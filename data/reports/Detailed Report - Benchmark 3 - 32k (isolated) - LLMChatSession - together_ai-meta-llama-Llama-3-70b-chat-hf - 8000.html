It’s not like he hasn’t slept over friend’s houses, or no one else has ever seen him sleeping before. But this. This is different. The light coming from the window is usually scarce, because Jungkook doesn’t like waking up with the sun in his eyes, nor does Taehyung. However, the night before Taehyung had insisted that they should watch the stars together, because he’s been studying them and he wanted to show everything he had learned to Jungkook as well. (Jungkook was studying them too, because he was really curious about things, especially things Taehyung was curious about, but he enjoyed to listen to Taehyung talk as if he was teaching him from scratch, his observations and words always beautiful and way more interesting than the ones Jungkook had read on the internet.) So, this time around, Taehyung’s face is clear and bright under the morning light, the slope of his nose highlighted, each and every mole apparent, lips puffed and slightly parted, face squished against the pillow by Jungkook’s side on Jungkook’s bed. And Jungkook stares, because he’s not fully awake just yet. He takes a while to wake up, always have, and therefore there’s nothing to stop him from staring. Even blinking comes slow and lazily, and that has nothing to do with the fact he’s a little hypnotized by the view. It’s just how it is. How things are. How he is. Hopefully, how they are. It’s simply not a step he’s willing to take. Not right now. A step bigger than his legs are, that’s what it feels like. He wants to reach for it, oh, Jungkook does. But that might scare Taehyung away. Taehyung isn’t ready for that just yet. And that’s really fine. Just, moments like this, under the rising sun, on his bed, by Taehyung’s side, this feels all too different. Too beautiful, too good, too much. His chest aches, then, for something. A warmth. Someone. A proximity lacking, and he needs it then, as if his life depends on it, his chest is pulling Taehyung to him, begging, screaming, heart threatening to burst through if Jungkook doesn’t do something, anything. Maybe it works, and the thing inside his chest is so strong that it manages to make Taehyung stir in his sleep, and literally roll to Jungkook’s side. Or it’s just Taehyung, being Taehyung, and squishing his face into Jungkook’s chest is just way better than any pillow could ever be. He sighs in contentment, sinking further into Jungkook’s aching chest, and in a moment it’s like there was never any pain there, to begin with. I must be going crazy, is what Jungkook thinks, breathing through his nose as slowly and quietly as he can. “‘Mmnornin, Koo.”  A heartbeat—one Taehyung certainly hears, left ear pressed against Jungkook’s heart—and a soft smile on Jungkook’s lips as he replies, voice hoarse from sleep:  “Good morning, Taetae.”  And Jungkook is glad he gets to wake up like this a bunch of days. Because this. This is special. On other days he wakes up with a punch to the stomach, yeah, sometimes even with a pair of feet resting way too close to his face, but still. Still, this isn’t something he’d ever trade. 	2. Chapter 2  The bad thing about sleeping with Jungkook is the one thing that shouldn’t be bad at all about sleeping. Only, it’s 7h10 and Taehyung really needs to wake up, really needs to get ready to work, really needs to _get out of bed._  But capitalism. As Yoongi said, capitalism ruined the simplest, most beautiful thing ever. Sleep</li>

Because it _is_ addicting. Once he found his way into Jungkook’s bed, it was really hard to resist the urge of inviting himself in every night. He only did it for the sake of Jungkook not getting tired of him, and throwing him out of their shared apartment. “Koo, we gotta wake up now.”  Jungkook mumbles this time, maybe they took a ten minutes nap from the moment they exchanged good mornings. It happens frequently. Taehyung pokes his ribs, rather carefully, but the location guarantees an immediate reaction. The body under him moved, and Taehyung looks up to find an angry look pointed down at his face. “Must you hurt me in order to wake me up, Taehyung?”  “Yeah. Otherwise, you never do, not as fast as we need you to, at least. Plus, that didn’t really hurt, you’re just being a baby.”  “It hurt. I’m very sensitive when I wake up.”  Taehyung almost beams at the slip-up, his day already made when his lips part and he pronounces very attentively:  “Oh?”  Jungkook is torn between blushing and grunting, and that gets a pillow smashed into Taehyung’s face. “Why are you like this?” He rolls out of bed, maybe suppressing his laughter. Taehyung giggles, getting up too. “This is an important piece of information, Koo, I can tell your future girlfriend about it, and that’s gonna be good for you later.”  He winks, and Jungkook visibly rolls his eyes. “Yeah, and she wouldn’t find it suspicious at all that you somehow seem to have this important piece of information.”  Taehyung realizes a lot of things at once, but the most important one is that Jungkook shouldn’t get a girlfriend anytime soon. That would mean the end of their nights sleeping together. He feels too selfish to actually say that out loud, so he moved to the bathroom instead, Jungkook’s bathroom, and grabbed his toothbrush, his extra toothbrush that has been used more times than his actual toothbrush, almost forgotten at his own bathroom. Still, Jungkook is too attentive to let something like this pass by unnoticed, his eyes are careful on Taehyung and some of the hairs on his nape bristle as an effect. Jungkook walks to his side and grabs his own toothbrush. “What?”  Taehyung stops brushing. “Promise me one thing.”  “Huh?”  “Just say you’ll promise me one thing.”  Jungkook looks down to his toothbrush as he puts on some toothpaste. “That’s already a promise, Tae.”  “Whatever. Then promise twice.”  Jungkook smiles, rather softly. “Yeah, okay.”  “Hm. Good.” Taehyung takes the toothbrush off his mouth, and lowers himself to spit on the sink. When he rises again, Jungkook is brushing his teeth, waiting only mildly curiously. “Then promise we’ll still do everything we do now even if we start dating someone.”  His brain supplies an “else” that stays on Taehyung’s mind only, echoing like a disturbing horror movie sound. He’s got no idea why he thought that, but it’s probably just a habit, from usually saying the words “someone else” together. Jungkook nods within a heartbeat, and that’s enough to appease Taehyung messy head. Then he looks surprised, as if he had just understood what Taehyung has said. Not what he _asked,_ but what was being said behind all that. He’s smug the rest of that hellish day, as Taehyung leaves to his own bathroom to shower (not before Jungkook purposely gets toothpaste on his nose), as they prepare tea and eat before leaving, on the way to the bus stop, all the way to the subway station, Jungkook doesn’t utter a word but his smile says everything</li>

At some point, they started going to work together, then they were going to college together too, and sharing the touring road trips together, and suddenly they were… living under the same roof. It happened naturally. It was a better location, rent cheaper than they were paying before, because they could split the bills. It was only reasonable. And, well, the company was not unwelcome at all. Jungkook is a trainee now, recently graduated, so he usually arrives home first. Taehyung is a junior, and he’s far from being a workaholic — that’s easily a lot more like Jungkook — , but in between distractions he always comes home around eight p.m., while Jungkook is sometimes free even before six. Their roles on the Orchestra had nothing to do with their work titles — that was more salary and work hours related. Whereas Jungkook was a pianist, Taehyung played the cello. Neither of them were soloists yet, but their Orchestra was a little different than the most formal ones. This Thursday, however, Taehyung had promised to get home as soon as he could, so he could help Jungkook with the laundry. _ The laundry _ is a very specific procedure which Jungkook prefers to take care of himself. He had his own difficulties in the beginning, but by now he was quite the expert in washing machines. Well, at least with the washing machine that was  _ theirs. _  He never denied the company, however, and Taehyung could never stay still for too long, not even when he was lying down. “God, Tae, that was too much detergent.”  “That’s what you put the last time! I paid attention.”  His forehead creases, lips pressed tightly together on a pout. “Yeah, and we found out that night that it was too much detergent! And we had a lot more clothes inside back then…” They were getting the hang of the whole house chores thing, the days where clothes would pile up until they were almost a living creature left way behind them. They exchange quizzical looks. Taehyung’s smile is practically sly as he pushes the start button. “We’ll have to wash it all twice. Mark my words.” Jungkook sighs, defeated. “Wanna bet?”  That makes him take a 180 degrees turn. “What?”  “Dinner. It’s on me if you’re right. You can choose.”  “Will we go out?”  “Sure. Not too far, though, I know you’re tired.”  Jungkook shrugs. He is, and so must be Taehyung — it was a long week — , but they rarely ever go out to eat. “Deal.”  They deal with the first batch of clothes while the washing machine works, and soon the foam leaking out of the machinery’s door is a good enough indicative that, yeah, Jungkook was right after all. Unfortunately, they only notice the foam the moment when Taehyung slips on it. It all happens in slow motion right in front of Jungkook’s widened eyes. A jacket is thrown to the ceiling, Taehyung’s arms reaching for any kind of support as he falls to his imminent death. Or so it looks like, which prompts Jungkook to react as fast and best as he can. That doesn’t guarantee, however, that the results are anything different from the both of them falling down, weirdly tangled, but all the heads involved in the disaster are  _ safely  _ away from the floor and all the pointy corners surrounding them. “Ouch, my ass.”  Jungkook breathes in a ridiculous amount of air. “Least it wasn’t that thing attached to your neck which apparently you never use for anything at all.”  “Hey! No need to get all aggressive on me now.”  Jungkook grunts. “My back…”  Taehyung scrambles to get off of him, sitting up. “Did you hit it somewhere? Are you hurt? I–”  “No</li>

You?”   Taehyung visibly relaxes, eyes closing as his lips shape into a signature boxy-smile. “Yeah, thanks to you! My hero.”  “Don’t go quoting anime on me right now.”  “I’m only quoting because you can recognize it, otherwise I’d just be  _ saying _ it. It’s a normal phrase, you weeb. People say that all the time.”  “The frequency and the generalization are both highly debatable. Anyway, I win.”  “Huh?”  “The bet. I want barbecue, by the way.”  “Huuh?” Taehyung’s face gets impossibly close, closer than it was when they were literally tangled. “You’re really going for my savings here, Koo.”  Jungkook laughs, which grants him foam at his right cheek. Foam he never saw coming because he had a serious case of Taehyung tunnel-vision. But even after a battle with the detergent’s foam—there are no winners, both of them sticky and dirty — , and the shower they have to take while the washing machine works for the second time, Taehyung never mentions it again. “Hey, we don’t really have to…”  “Shh, I was just playing with you. Barbecue is great, actually. That’s what money’s for, right?”  Taehyung’s face disappears behind a floral shirt, and they resume hanging out the clothes. “Eating?”  The shirt wavers as he hears a chuckle. “That, too.”  _ And what else? _  Jungkook waits, but Taehyung never explains himself. 	4. Chapter 4  “Oh, I’m sorry, I have plans for tonight already.”  Jiwoo’s smile doesn’t waver, as kind and collected as it was a moment ago, when she offered an invitation to the pub nearby, along with at least half of their musicians. “Where are you going? Perhaps we can meet at some point… just to say hi? It’s a group hangout, after all.”  “Hahah, I don’t think that will happen, no, my plans involve staying in.”  “Really? You could do that another time, though…”  Has he been avoiding hanging out with his coworkers that much? No, not really, they almost never did this kind of thing, maybe that’s why Jiwoo was being so forceful. However, she wasn’t being invasive. Her tone was respectful and inviting. “Definitely not, no, I promised Jungkook we would do a movie marathon and eat popcorn. He’s never going to forgive me if I make him leave the house instead. To a pub.”  He laughs, and Jiwoo nods, tilting her head. “Cute.”  “Hm?” Taehyung blinks, not sure if he got it right. _Cute?_  “Your friendship is really cute, you must really care about him.”  “Of course I do! I care about all of my friends.”  Even as he says it, Taehyung feels the lie on his tongue. It tastes weird, and kind of bitter, because it isn’t a lie. He  _is_ a good friend, always has been, and he’s got a pretty chunky list of people who could vow to that. But… it’s a lot more than his responsibility as a friend, here. And of course, of course it is, Jungkook is a very dear friend with whom Taehyung really enjoys to spend time with. So why the hell would he cancel on Jungkook, if he actually had been waiting for their night in the whole week? He never voices that, parting ways a little awkwardly. It’s like Jiwoo is waiting for something he’s got no idea _what_ might be. Luckily, he doesn’t dwell too long on it. Taehyung goes to the nearest market and buys ice cream too, mint chocolate flavored because it's Jungkook's favorite, and soon enough he is home. No one questioning him, only popcorn and a movie night with Jungkook ahead of him. Who would even dare to prefer a pub to this? Everything’s already arranged, even if Jungkook isn’t on sight</li>

Their conversation is lighthearted and flirtatious, with a hint of intimacy. The way Taehyung gets close to Jungkook, making him laugh and getting foam on his face, suggests a strong physical connection between them.<br><br>It's interesting that Taehyung doesn't mention the bet again, even after their playful dispute.

He puts his shoes away before answering. “Yep.”  “Go shower, I’m cooking lamen.”  “Cooking, right,” Taehyung teases, entering the small kitchen and going for the freezer. Jungkook stops midway what would possibly be a complain the second he sees what Taehyung is doing. “Ice cream? Is it ice cream?”  Taehyung shrugs, hiding the package as best as he can as he stores it inside the refrigerator. “It’s a surprise.”  The faintest smile passes through Jungkook’s frame before he fakes annoyance, furrowing his eyebrows and frowning. Taehyung sprints to his bathroom, taking the quickest shower of his entire life and rushing back to the cozy living room, where he finds Jungkook this time around, sitting surrounded by the pillows, and starring the lamen cups with big, hungry eyes. “Only four?”  He points to the floor beside him, where another four lamen cups remain closed, next to a thermal jug which is probably filled with hot water. Of _course_ there was more. Taehyung sits by Jungkook’s side and they start their marathon, burning their tongues and crying from the extra spice of the lamens, emptying a few water bottles before finishing six of the eight cups. It’s comfortable between them, intimacy coming naturally with gentle and tender touches, even when Jungkook pokes his ribs, or Taehyung flicks his earlobe, this is even more comfortable than the nest made of pillows and blankets on the floor. There isn't much space left for the popcorn after that, but they manage. And desserts get a whole other stomach for them, Jungkook's eyes shining so brightly it almost blinds Taehyung in the darkness of their home. They eat from the pot, and Jungkook almost gets a brain freeze, saved by Taehyung physically pulling it away from his grip. The movies are dumb, zombie comedies, and they manage to get to the third one before Jungkook starts to doze off, head falling on Taehyung’s shoulder. Still, he struggles against the sleep, refusing to go to bed and pretending to be awake every time Taehyung says something. He can’t help but smile fondly, and discreetly try to make their position more adequate for Jungkook to sleep. They have two beds, and a perfectly good sofa, but every once in a while sleeping on the living room floor isn’t that bad, either. 	5. Chapter 5  He only ever heads back home by himself if there’s something waiting for him to do that can’t be dealt with later. Most times, there’s a lot he can do near work: groceries, bookstores, malls. The possibilities are endless, and time waiting for Taehyung is too scarce for him to even notice. Soon enough his phone chimes and it certainly is Taehyung asking if he’s still around. Sometimes he heads home first, even cooks a little something for dinner—Taehyung always praises his food, and Jungkook thinks he’s just talking his ears off because he wants Jungkook to cook more. Either way, he can’t deny that it works a _little._ And he himself thinks his food isn’t half as bad as it could be. But one thing rarely changes, even during the weekends. It’s almost as if Taehyung _puts him to bed._  Not literally, Jungkook isn’t a kid anymore, but he is kind of an insomniac. Taehyung has his own moments, too, but Jungkook is really worse. He forgets to sleep, he doesn’t notice the time passing by, and he’s awful at dealing with his own insomnia. The biggest proof of that is: He has some sick playlists to help him sleep, but does he remember to use them? So the first thing that happens is: Taehyung brews him some tea. And Taehyung takes that pretty seriously—he’s studied all kinds of plants and herbs after the best teas he could make to help Jungkook. They are ridiculously good, too, and how Taehyung manages this is out of his comprehension</li>

He’s always liked Taehyung’s voice, that ain’t something new. Listening to it to sleep has its disadvantages—that’s how the dreams started—, but are they really disadvantages? When the tea ends, Taehyung drags Jungkook to bed and keeps talking his ears off. Jungkook talks back, too, some times more than others, but his tongue drags heavier inside his mouth. His own voice is deeper than usual, letting his tiredness show. The tea sure has an effect, his eyelids can barely hold up, and he _likes_ to hear Taehyung talk. Taehyung can be silent for long times, and Jungkook likes that, too, but Taehyung’s voice seems to make his heart overflow. Sadly, it’s not always that Taehyung stays. For some reason Jungkook can’t understand, he has to go to his own bed. He considers disposing of Taehyung’s bed a few times, but then he would have to give up the times Taehyung invited him to his bed instead of joining in Jungkook’s one, and he wasn’t ready for that yet. It was nice and different when they watched a drama or anime in _Taehyung’s_ bed. And Taehyung _invited_ him to stay. Jungkook liked sleeping in Taehyung’s bed too, and for that to keep happening Taehyung had to have his own bed. Unfortunately. Watching anime before bed is a big no—they both get way too excited, and end up sleeping way past one in the morning. That, sometimes, happens. But not much. Taehyung takes sleeping seriously, for his sake. Which is why most of the times he leaves Jungkook’s bed when he thinks Jungkook is already asleep, Jungkook won’t say anything. Most times, however, aren’t tonight. On some rare occasions such as now, Jungkook reaches his left hand, towards Taehyung’s wrist, and grabs it gently. “You’re still awake?” Taehyung whispers, surprised. They barely slept that Saturday, waking up to sunlight on their faces because the living room windows are big and the curtains translucent. The movie marathon the night before had Jungkook sleeping on the floor, he just didn’t want it to end. “Barely,” he answers, not even opening his eyes. Taehyung waits in silence for a moment, then asks: “You want something?”   _Stay,_ Jungkook thinks. _You don’t have to go._  “Nah,” he answers instead, suddenly way more nervous than he should be. What was he thinking? Why did he reach for Taehyung when Taehyung clearly wanted to leave? “... Then?”  Jungkook loosens the grip on Taehyung’s wrist, pulling back. “It’s nothing. Sorry.”  Silence befalls the room, Taehyung isn’t moving and Jungkook is definitely getting more anxious by the second. He opens his eyes at the same time Taehyung lays down again. “I’m staying. My job here isn’t done yet.”  Jungkook chuckles, closing his eyes again in a dumb attempt at hiding his embarrassment. “That’s not your _job_.”  “Hmph. Who said that?” He can hear Taehyung moving closer, until his body is wrapping around Jungkook’s waist, pressing his face against Taehyung’s chest. “They’re right, but only because I’m doing this because I want to. Now, let’s go to sleep, Koo. Good night.”  Jungkook lets out a breath he didn’t know he was holding. “Night.”  It’s a little strangled, but Taehyung tightens the embrace and runs his fingers through Jungkook’s hair, and soon enough he’s not conscious enough to be nervous about anything at all. 	6</li>

Jungkook spaces out through most of it, dutifully pushing the shopping cart, even though he enjoys the food bits. And there are always food bits, no matter how many times they hit the market. “Detergent _again_?” Jungkook asks, startled to see it inside their cart. “Yes? Have you seen the number of dishes we make?”  “Have you seen the amount of _laundry_ we make? And we’re not buying detergent for _that_ again.”  Taehyung shakes his head, chuckling. “Oh, honey, that’s not how this works.”  Jungkook’s face heats up instantly, and he focuses on hiding it instead of arguing. Taehyung must be right, he’s the one who can’t see a single spoon on the kitchen sink before he’s doing the dishes again. A worker nearby drops one of the cans she’s piling up on the bottom shelf, attracting both their eyes for a second. “Anyway, last time we bought this was just a test, sometimes I’m allergic to detergents. This one is good, though, and it’s cheaper too, so we’re buying more.”  Jungkook shrugs. “Fair enough.”  “What else is on the list?”  “Cereals. And eggs.”  “Oh, this way then!”  They stop when there’s enough to fill four—ecological—bags, heading to the single counter and waiting for the cashier to come. It’s a small market, a little farther from their apartment building than other markets, but Taehyung likes to support local businesses such as this one. And so does Jungkook, who also appreciates the extras they get whenever the owners are around, and the homemade treats they always have. “Look, Tae, homemade melonpan!”  Taehyung eyes it with curiosity. Their melonpan is his favorite. “Is it fresh?”  Before Jungkook can check the date, the same worker from before answers, assuming the cashier’s place. “Yes! They were baked today.”  “Can we buy them? Can we, Tae?”  Jungkook’s eyes sparkle, as if Taehyung was ever going to deny him and he needed to resort to such a low trick. “Sure, you big baby.”  The woman chuckles as Jungkook gets them _four_ packages, and Taehyung flicks his earlobe and messes with his hair, almost annoyed with his cuteness. “How long have you two been together, if you don’t mind me asking?”  Taehyung’s smile fades into confusion as he stops looking at Jungkook and turns to the cashier. “Uh?” It’s Jungkook who asks, though, eyes big and curious. The cashier fumbles with the groceries, visibly flustered. “Um, you two live together, right?”  “Yeah, but…”  Taehyung interrupts him, throwing his arm around Jungkook’s shoulders. “Almost two years, ain’t it, Koo?”  “Huh? Tae, I don’t think that’s what-”  Taehyung nods, turning back to her. “Almost two years now!”  The woman nods, smiling shyly. “You… both seem really happy, that’s all. Sorry if I stepped out of line...”  “Not at all! We don’t really keep track of time because it’s just so effortless. Time passes too fast. I am happy. Aren’t you, Koo?”  Jungkook nods, albeit visibly stunned. The cashier finishes helping them with their groceries, and as soon as they step out of the market, Jungkook says, very slowly:  “I have no idea what just happened.”  Taehyung laughs, nerves hidden by how loud he allows himself to be now that they’re out in the open. “Mr. and Ms</li>

The scene takes place at a local market, where they are grocery shopping together. Taehyung is enthusiastic about buying detergent, which Jungkook questions, leading to a humorous exchange.<br><br>As they continue shopping, they come across a homemade melonpan, which Jungkook is excited about. The cashier, noting their close relationship, asks how long they've been together, which leads to a misunderstanding. Taehyung, perhaps jokingly or playfully, says they've been together for almost two years, which seems to take Jungkook by surprise.<br><br>Throughout the passage, the tone is lighthearted and affectionate, with moments of humor and playfulness. The relationship between Taehyung and Jungkook is depicted as loving and comfortable, with Taehyung being more outgoing and Jungkook being more introverted.<br><br>The passage also hints at the idea that Taehyung and Jungkook may not publicly identify as a couple or may not have explicitly discussed their relationship status, as evidenced by Jungkook's confusion and the cashier's mistake. However, the scene ultimately conveys a sense of happiness and contentment between the two characters.</li>

Chapter 7  “I’d rather die.”  “Lovely. We still promised Hoseok we would go. Even _Min Yoongi_ is going.”  “That I’ll have to see with my own two eyes to believe it.”  “Then _wake up,_ Taehyung.”  Jungkook pushes him for real this time, and Taehyung almost falls off the bed. This is why he’s usually the first one to wake up, and not the other way around. As he huffs and grumbles in surprise, all Jungkook does is _laugh._  _So inconsiderate._  “I was almost there!”  “You’ve been almost there for the past thirty minutes. Breakfast is ready, you have five minutes to get ready and move your ass to the kitchen.”  “Harsh.”  In truth, it’s really hard to wake up and get ready fast when the perspective of running a marathon is the only thing on his horizon. On a Sunday, above all. Taehyung isn’t the biggest fan of running, that’s all. Goddamn Hoseok and all his voluntary work. No, scratch that. Voluntary work was great, overall, but why did it have to involve _running_ of all things? “He has to stop trying to impress Namjoon,” he declares as soon as he steps in the kitchen, where Jungkook waits, playing some game on his smartphone. “Hm? Isn’t Joon and Jimin a thing?”  “What? !”  “Yeah, I thought everyone knew?”  “How did _you_ find that out?”  “... Anyway, Yoongi is the one trying to impress someone.”  “ _What_?”  Jungkook laughs, pretending to be too busy with his game to reply as Taehyung eats his cereal. Is everyone on their orchestra group of friends dating or _interested_ in dating someone? That’s just absurd. Yeah, they’re all pretty cute, yes, but dating? A relationship? It just sounds… No, Taehyung can’t see that. _Wait._ But what about Jungkook? “So…” He starts, instantly earning a glare from Jungkook. In turn, he apparently dies in the game he was playing, so Taehyung gets more than two seconds of his attention. “Have _you_ got your eyes on anyone?”  Jungkook coughs like he’s choked on something, perhaps air. “What?”  “Everyone’s dating or something, apparently. I thought you might’ve been, too?”  “No. _No,_ ” Jungkook repeats, with extra emphasis. “Not dating?”  “No.”  “Not even any crushes?”  “We should get going.”  “Oh?” He looks down at his bowl, finding it still half-full. “But I’m not finished. Koo-”  He drinks it in a hurry, praying it won’t be too bad for his stomach, and rushes to the front door where Jungkook awaits still looking flustered. Or mad, because they’re late? Or both. The marathon isn’t too far, but they need to catch a bus first. Still, they’re pretty on time—Hoseok compliments their punctuality and Taehyung raises an eyebrow at Jungkook, who simply ignores him. It’s not as bad as it seemed to be now that they’re here. It’s a nice day, not cold but not hot either, and of Taehyung manages to take it easy, he’s positive he can reach the finish line. He does the stretching carefully, with Jungkook’s help. Jungkook is probably ending the marathon in first place, the way he’s always exercising around the apartment and going out for night or morning runs at ass o’clock. He even looks like a natural, like he’s a part of this environment instead of one of the people brought by a friend. He goes around helping everyone he can, morning sunlight hitting the most prominent features of his face and catching Taehyung’s eyes. Taehyung squints, but doesn’t look away</li>

The chapter starts with Taehyung being lazy and not wanting to wake up, but Jungkook eventually gets him up and ready to go. They have a conversation about their friends, including Min Yoongi, and it's implied that many of them are in romantic relationships or have crushes on each other. Taehyung teases Jungkook about possibly having a crush on someone, but Jungkook denies it.<br><br>As they head to the marathon, Taehyung is still grumbling about having to run, but Jungkook is enthusiastic and helpful. Once they arrive, Jungkook is his usual athletic self, helping others and looking like a natural in the running environment. Taehyung, on the other hand, is still struggling with the idea of running, but seems to be taking it more seriously as he stretches and prepares to start.<br><br>The chapter ends with Taehyung noticing Jungkook's good looks as he helps others, and it seems like there might be some subtle romantic tension or admiration between the two friends.</li>

Imagine if you had some practice.”  Taehyung lets out a weak snarl, lacking any bite to it. “I’d rather just keep watching you doing your routines around the house, thanks.”  If Jungkook blushes, it’s well hidden by the exercising blush that’s still there. “C’mon, Tae. It was way better running along with you than it is running by myself every day. I’ll keep up with you, and we don’t have to go every day. _Please._ ”  That’s true. Jungkook had kept his pace throughout the whole marathon, and that was probably why Taehyung had actually crossed the finish line. It was just impossible to resist Jungkook’s puppy eyes. It was a trap all along, and Taehyung should have known it. “Fine.”  Jungkook’s face lights up instantly, and Taehyung almost feels good with himself for being the cause for his euphoria. A blond drops by Jungkook’s side at the crosswalk, offering Taehyung a cold water bottle. “It wasn’t even that hard.”  And, truly, he’s barely breaking any sweat. In fact, Yoongi looks almost _exactly_ like he did right before the marathon. Jungkook only chuckles by his side, and something clicks inside Taehyung’s head. “Bastard. You called a taxi, didn’t you?”  Yoongi feigns innocence and utter bafflement. “I would _never_ think of something like that.” 	8. Chapter 8  The one thing Jungkook always tried to avoid was a matter of principle. Borrowing clothes from Taehyung was completely out of line. Because he had feelings Taehyung wasn’t aware of, and he could never wear even a t-shirt from Taehyung without feeling stupidly giddy about it. This self-imposed rule only made him really good at having a tight schedule for their laundries. However. The weather was something Jungkook couldn’t control just yet, and walking around the apartment without a t-shirt? That is fine. Going out in the cold weather without a hoodie? Well, that’s just not as fine. Luckily, Jungkook wouldn’t have to leave the house before his hoodies were all dry and ready to go, because it was still Sunday. “Okay, we have like… six clothing items, together.” Taehyung states, scientifically. “I’ll just stay under the blankets the whole day.”  Taehyung chuckles, leaning into him. It makes everything inside Jungkook lights up, but he does his best to remain still. “Don’t be dumb, you should wear this.”   And maybe it’s because the specific item of clothing is so unexpected that Jungkook’s brain comes to a halt, but he can’t deny it. He ends up promptly accepting the pastel yellow crop top (crop top???) with long sleeves and then it’s too late to deny it. Taehyung is happily singsonging to his favorite song (at the moment) and waltzing away from the laundry room, and Jungkook tries the crop top on  _ just because. _ It has their laundry’s smell, after all, it shouldn’t be that dangerous. … Except for the fact that he can’t stop imagining Taehyung wearing this exact piece of clothing. When? In which context? Why hadn’t Jungkook heard  _ anything  _ about this? They literally _ lived together. _  He can t deny the clothing item is fairly comfortable, and wearing nothing isn’t exactly appalling when it’s almost snowing outside. Even when their heating system is working just fine</li>

Let me summarize what's happening:<br><br>Jungkook and Taehyung just finished a marathon, and Jungkook is beaming with pride, encouraging Taehyung to join him for more runs. Taehyung reluctantly agrees, and they're interrupted by Yoongi, who seems to have taken a taxi instead of running the marathon. Later, Jungkook finds himself in a situation where he has to borrow clothes from Taehyung because his own clothes are still in the laundry. Jungkook is hesitant at first because he has secret feelings for Taehyung, but eventually accepts a pastel yellow crop top with long sleeves. As he tries it on, he can't help but imagine Taehyung wearing the same top, and his mind starts to wander.<br><br>It's clear that Jungkook has strong feelings for Taehyung, but is trying to keep them hidden. The dynamic between the two is adorable, with Jungkook being his usual energetic and enthusiastic self, and Taehyung being more laid-back and teasing.

When their group chat with their friends from work decides to come back to life talking about dinner (? ), Taehyung jumps out of bed and runs to the laundry again, rummaging through their laundry, more clothes dry than before, and for some reason, Jungkook gets to wear his own clothes again, but Taehyung needs a hoodie. And all Taehyung’s hoodies are either wet or dirty. So. “Mines are finally dry,” Jungkoook offers, in exchange for the crop top offer earlier. “Look, it was an unexpected change of weather, we couldn’t have known,” Taehyung says, already wearing Jungkook’s jacket, not sure about what he’s even accepting, only worried about not catching a cold. “Yeah,” Jungkook agrees, reluctantly. But there’s not much he can do. His selfish feelings have absolutely nothing to do with this. ⭒⭑⭒⭑⭒  Namjoon saw them getting in the restaurant and gasps when he sees what Taehyung is wearing because there, at Taehyung’s back, is Jungkook’s name. Printed on fabric. Everyone is shellshocked, and then Seokjin says, “Congrats on the relationship update! !”  Jungkook looked confused and even more so Taehyung, even from afar, but their friends were just happy. They come to their table and greet everyone, Jungkook getting redder by the second. “Fucking finally,” Jimin says, making space for them right by his side. “We can order now.”  “It was about time,” Hoseok says, winking Jungkook’s way. Taehyung looks from Hoseok to Jungkook, and the later avoids him. “To order food?”  “Yeah, sure,” Hoseok winks again, and Taehyung looks like he’s about to lose it. They choose a meal course to share, neither of them super hungry but both wanting extra fries, and even though that’s usual, every single person on their table sighs, calling them disgusting,  _ of fucking course they’re gonna share. _ And that’s when Taehyung loses it. He stands up, shouting “Restroom!” and dragging Jungkook along with him. “Why does everyone seem to think that we’re dating now?”  Jungkook hides further inside his hoodie. “It’s the jacket. The one I lent you.”  “What about it? I mean, what if they know it’s yours, what does it have to do with…”  “Hmm, it’s my university’s varsity jacket.”  Taehyung looks right into his eyes, in complete silence. “Oh.”  “I’m sorry, I just- you needed something, and it was dry, and-”  “You let me borrow your varsity jacket! That’s so cute. _ Cutie. _ It’s an honor, I can’t believe it. I need a mirror, might snap some pics since we’re here, I’m wearing your varsity fucking jacket oh my god-”  Jungkook is caught between dying and punching Taehyung, so he obviously only groans instead. “Taehyung…”  “Yeah, join the photo, come here!”  He ceases resisting Taehyung’s shenanigans and just enjoys the moment. He deserves it, Taehyung being ridiculous and posing a hundred different ways to show off Jungkook’s jacket is something he should be enjoying to the fullest. Christ</li>

The hoodie in question happens to be Jungkook's university varsity jacket, which leads to some... interesting reactions from their friends.<br><br>When they arrive at the restaurant, Namjoon notices Jungkook's name printed on the jacket Taehyung is wearing, and everyone starts teasing them about their "relationship update". Jungkook and Taehyung are both confused, but their friends are just happy and playful.

Something changes right there and then, and Jungkook mentally sighs. This is why there was a rule, and he should have never borrowed any piece of clothing from Taehyung. He was still wearing the yellow crop top under his hoodie, even though it wasn't to show off, it was there, and he knew it, and that was why he was wearing it, despite whatever Taehyung thought it was.

The fact that he's wearing Taehyung's yellow crop top under his hoodie suggests that he's been drawn to Taehyung's scent or essence, and it's becoming a personal connection for him.<br><br>The line "This is why there was a rule" implies that Jungkook had established boundaries for himself to avoid getting too close to Taehyung, but now he's broken that rule by borrowing the clothing. It's almost as if he's surrendering to his feelings and can no longer deny the attraction he has for Taehyung.<br><br>The phrase "Now, there was _ no _ turning back" creates a sense of inevitability, implying that Jungkook has reached a point of no return. He's acknowledged his feelings, and it's only a matter of time before he acts on them or confesses to Taehyung.

Someone said Jungkook didn't like kisses, neither giving or receiving them, and Taehyung scoffed and said Jungkook also didn't happen to like hugs, and **still** , Taehyung could hug him whenever he felt like it. "So kiss him, then." Jimin provoked. Taehyung did. On Jungkook's right cheek, for whole three seconds and a half. Yes, Jungkook did count. He couldn't breathe for the whole thing, but right after it he put his tongue out for his friends, walking away as Taehyung puffed his chest looking very proud of himself. Jungkook laughed when he was at a safe distance, thinking of Taehyung showing off like a peacock for being allowed to kiss Jungkook's cheek. He was so dumb.

That’s not enough to put Jungkook at ease—the weather change was really unexpected, and he knows too damn well just how susceptible to them Taehyung is. While Jungkook’s been dealing with his allergies throughout his whole life, Taehyung rarely ever gets sick. He’s got iron immunity, superhero worthy, but every time Taehyung does get sick, it’s official hospital visiting hours. Even his colds look like a new damn virus just got brought into the world. Maybe Jungkook is a little too impressionable, maybe he’s worrying too much. However, as long as there’s a probability he could be even remotely right, he’s not going to change.

It’s not that they dislike their families – completely not their case, at all, but the timing. Always the timing. “I’m going to die,” Jungkook states, and Taehyung knows it’s not drama because he feels it too. He feels it, but he needs to be the stronger one this time, and so he says “It’s a day off, we’ve been working day and night in preparation for this, right? We deserve a little rest, too.

Something nice, nothing like a birthday party, mind you. Jungkook used to keep tabs on special dates, for a good time, until he realized it was dumb and meaningless. Of course, if you were giving it meaning, then it meant something. But what he found out was that he, in fact, enjoyed a lot more spontaneous acts of affection.

This is likely because he doesn't like being the center of attention or maybe he just doesn't find birthdays to be a significant occasion.<br>* Because his birthday falls on the last day of the year, Taehyung takes advantage of this coincidence to avoid having a birthday party. Instead, he suggests doing something else that's "nice" but not necessarily birthday-related.<br>* Jungkook, on the other hand, used to keep track of special dates like birthdays, but eventually realized that it wasn't as important to him as he thought. However, he does enjoy spontaneous acts of affection and gestures of love.<br>* Despite knowing Jungkook's preference for spontaneous gestures, Taehyung still went ahead and bought him a gift he had been eyeing for weeks - a pair of jacket and pants. This shows that Taehyung is thoughtful and considerate of Jungkook's feelings.<br><br>Overall, this chapter gives us a glimpse into the personalities and dynamics of Taehyung and Jungkook's relationship. It's a sweet and intimate moment that highlights their connection and understanding of each other.</li>

You’re hurt.”  Taehyung rolls his eyes, but he can’t keep the endearment he feels for Jungkook from overflowing in a soft smile. “Fine. I’ll put the clean dishes away, then.”  “Just leave them there, Tae...”  “No, Jungkook, I am helping. You helped me cook, so it’s only fair.”  Jungkook exhales, looking fed up with him and his headstrongness. “Only the dry ones. None of the things I’m going to wash now.”  “Deal,” Taehyung agrees with a chuckle. This is all so… See, he does not want to think that, but _domestic._ It is, isn’t it? They’re not just two people sharing an apartment. Per se, they never were, because their friendship was great and they were each other’s best friends. But this was, somehow, a whole new level. Makes him laugh that this seems more personal than sleeping together on the same bed. Makes him question how happy that seems to make him.</li>

It's clear that Taehyung wants to take care of Jungkook, especially since Jungkook is hurt. The dynamic between them is adorable, with Taehyung being playful and stubborn, while Jungkook is exasperated but ultimately accepting.<br><br>The interesting thing here is that Taehyung is starting to realize that their living situation has become more than just two friends sharing an apartment. He's hesitant to admit it, but he's feeling a sense of domesticity, of being in a partnership that goes beyond friendship. It's almost as if doing everyday tasks together, like cooking and cleaning, has brought them closer together.<br><br>Taehyung's internal monologue is quite revealing, as he's surprised by how happy this makes him. It seems that he's questioning his own feelings and the nature of his relationship with Jungkook. It's a lovely, tender moment that suggests there might be more to their friendship than meets the eye.<br><br>What do you think? Should we continue exploring this scene, or would you like to discuss something else?</li>

Chapter 9  “I’m going to cook,” Taehyung announces, to Jungkook’s absolute shock. They’re wrecked. Both of them, utterly destroy by pre-concert rehearsals. Normally, that’s when they skip meals or eat sandwiches and bento boxes the most, not when Taehyung decides to give his try at the chef life. “Um. Okay?”  “C’mon, take a shower and let’s do this. I’m starving.”  Jungkook silently agrees, just heading for his bathroom and showering. He knows he’s been acting cold and distant, and what’s worse, he feels that Taehyung knows it too. Maybe it’s all in his head, but guilt still eats away at him. Taehyung has nothing to do with his feelings, and he shouldn’t be affected by whatever goes on with them. Jungkook is a bad friend, he’s a bad person, and these thoughts are bad because this is a difficult loop to escape.</li>

He thinks he's been acting cold and distant, and is worried that Taehyung has noticed and is affected by it. Jungkook's inner monologue is quite harsh on himself, calling himself a bad friend and person. This suggests that he has high standards for himself and is frustrated when he falls short.<br><br>Taehyung, on the other hand, appears to be oblivious to Jungkook's inner turmoil. He's focusing on the present moment and is excited to cook a meal together. His announcement to cook comes as a surprise to Jungkook, but he's not reading into it as a way to address their recent dynamics.<br><br>This scene sets the stage for a potential heart-to-heart conversation between the two friends. Will Jungkook open up to Taehyung about his feelings, or will he continue to internalize his emotions?</li>

The ravager's head turns and regards the people now gathering up the resources and moving between the behemoths and inspecting them, the other ravagers circling the settlement. "Query: What is the surprise?" "This is a working model," Petra says patiently, "of some of the arrangements we could make." She'd put a lot of work into making good use of her new Alpha clearance, something that gives her just as much control of the machines as HEPHAESTUS has, even if she lacks his mastery and finesse. She'd worked out enough on her own, however, to hide this particular thing from HEPHAESTUS while he'd been occupied with GAIA Prime. She'd figured it was the best first move to make, regardless of anything to follow - a working model of change, that the rest of the world can look to in order to see its effectiveness, its practicality. Of course, this is only a test run, and there will be adjustments based on settlement needs, and things thrown out altogether. Once the non-responsive machines are dealt with, a patrol around settlements won't be necessary, but the ravagers serve another purpose, too - getting the people of Free Heap acclimated to the presence of non-aggressive machines. The behemoths, meanwhile, are a prototype delivery system. "I wanted you to see the start," Petra continues. "It'll be a while before change really gets going, but I wanted you to have proof that we're working on it." The ravager looks at her again, silent. "Thank you, Petra," HEPHAESTUS says finally. Petra arches an eyebrow. "Oh? Never heard that one out of you before. Is ELEUTHIA rubbing off on you?" "I do not answer to my sister," HEPHAESTUS says, which speaks to the lie. The other two had gotten the habit of referring to each other with familial terms from ELEUTHIA - a good habit for all of them. Aloy had said something about stunted development from remaining isolated for so long and a need for normal interactions to promote maturation and empathy. GAIA's early development had required it, according to the records that Aloy had found, and Vanasha had voiced her agreement, citing improvement she'd observed in MINERVA. "Sure you don't," Petra says with a wink. It's been many a time that ELEUTHIA's voice has suddenly crackled through the Focus network, chiding her siblings for their arguing or instructing them in the use of manners. She pats the ravager's side. "Come on." HEPHAESTUS follows close on her heels as Petra moves through the gathering and gets a feel for Free Heap's impressions, which are overwhelmingly positive. She'd known her people would adjust well. They're mechanically-minded, after all, and are a rebellious, shirking-tradition sort. They wouldn't have come to Free Heap if they weren't. They're arguably the best group to test new arrangements on, and Petra knows the true difficulty will be elsewhere, with people less open to change, to machines. But that's a problem for another day. "You lead these humans," HEPHAESTUS observes, when most of the gathering has returned to their business. He and Petra are left with the behemoths, after Petra has finished giving instructions to cover for her next extended absence. "Informally," Petra says. "People tend to listen to me, if they need a figurehead to turn to in a pinch. But these people answer to themselves first. We work together because we have interests in common. We want our community to thrive." "It is an effective arrangement," HEPHAESTUS says. "Free Heap demonstrates efficiency." "Oh, now you're dishing out compliments, too? You must be in a good mood." HEPHAESTUS ignores her. The ravager turns to the behemoths, and something passes between them. The behemoths stir, forming a loose circle around HEPHAESTUS and Petra. "These units will escort us to Cauldron ZETA," HEPHAESTUS says, his voice subdued, moody. Petra knows that it stings for him, the non-responsive machines who refuse to cease their aggression</li>

HEPHAESTUS had taken the data and then shut APOLLO out entirely and rejected further contact, as unnerved as MINERVA had been by whatever he'd sensed. HEPHAESTUS hadn't acted on the suggestion until he'd grown determined to keep Aloy out of the Cauldrons, but adjusting machine cognition had done... something, to some of them. Put them outside of anyone's control. Even HEPHAESTUS can't explain it. Petra pats his side again. "I feel perfectly safe," she says. Three behemoths and a ravager is probably overkill, but she knows that HEPHAESTUS has begun to worry in earnest about her well-being. Her supplies are already bundled on the ravager's back, enough for the relatively short journey to Cauldron ZETA and a brief stay there. The last step in restoring GAIA lies before them, and as Petra climbs up onto the ravager's back, the anticipatory satisfaction of knowing that a job is close to completion begins to build. She can't even imagine how Aloy must be feeling. The girl has hardly left GAIA Prime, attending to its construction with a single-minded ferocity. Maybe GAIA will be able to convince her to take a nap every once in a while, after this. Petra reaches down and pats the ravager's neck, a silent indication that everything is set, and HEPHAESTUS takes off, the behemoths in tow. * * *  Vanasha comes across Talanah and some of the Lodge hunters at the edge of Meridian Village, spotting them on the road ahead as she passes the docks. One supports another who limps along, dried blood coating her leg, and Vanasha can easily imagine the injury that must lie beneath the bandages. She steps aside into the grass to let them pass, and the rest of the hunters continue on through the barbican's arch into the outer village. But Talanah stops, letting her hunters pass first, and comes up to Vanasha when they've moved past. "Stalker," she says, gesturing to the injured hunter. "Would've killed her, but a broadhead came out of nowhere and speared it, gave us an opening to finish it off." Talanah shakes her head, but there's a bit of wonder in her eyes. "I don't know if I'll ever be used to that." Vanasha smiles. She'd once thought so too, but she walks in MINERVA's world, in Aloy's world, with ease now. "Maybe you could start using docile machines to help," she suggests. They've been programmed to defend humans from their non-responsive brethren whenever possible, though she doesn't mention that. "Aloy's got a sawtooth at her beck and call. It's possible." "Not a bad idea," Talanah says thoughtfully. She gives Vanasha a quick glance - once again trying to place her and figure her out. She gives the surrounding area a fleeting scan while she's at it, as if it will somehow reveal Vanasha's secrets. But there is only the lake to the east and a towering promontory to the west, gleaming in the midday light. "Got any other locations for us to hit?" "Not yet," Vanasha says. "Erend will let you know when we do." Talanah nods and moves off with a farewell. Vanasha waits for a few moments, and her eyes find the Alight in the distance before snapping back to Talanah's retreating form. "Not a bad idea to consider for the future, by the way," she calls out, keeping her words vague. Talanah stops and looks back, a wry smile on her face. "It crossed my mind before you said it," she calls back. That one is a little too smart, Vanasha thinks, as Talanah heads into the village. But that's good for someone Avad keeps close and on his council. There aren't many nobles that Vanasha trusts, but Talanah isn't like most of them. She's a trailblazer, like Avad, and Aloy trusts her</li>

"HEPHAESTUS is already in position." "I know, I'm coming," Vanasha mutters. She glances back towards Meridian Village, but Talanah has disappeared, and the guards atop the barbican have already stopped paying attention. "You know he's going to win sometimes." MINERVA and HEPHAESTUS have been working together on the reprogramming effort; the machines had built all of the broadcast towers, after all, and MINERVA uses the tallnecks as well. But that interdependence between their protocols does not seem to guarantee harmony between them. Vanasha hadn't known how competitive MINERVA could be until she'd started working with her brother. She doesn't seem to appreciate how bossy he is. "Yes," MINERVA says shortly. "That is statistically inevitable. I do not like it." Vanasha laughs, continuing on down the road, over its bridges and following its curves, towards the Alight. * * *  The ELEUTHIA-9 Cradle is enormous. With MINERVA's help, ELEUTHIA had finally overridden most of the directives keeping the facility closed. Only the APOLLO database still remains cut off from her, and even MINERVA's skill had made no headway against it. But the locked doors, however, had opened to reveal several levels of the facility winding into the mountain. The inside is pristine, much more intact than the first level, mostly preserved due to the tight seal that had never been broken until now. Varl has explored its every corner, finding living quarters, recreation and storage areas, and rooms dedicated to further schooling. Those rooms contain other introductory messages from Samina Ebadji, and like the first one, they all short out eventually, as the facility computer interrupts. _Alert. Malfunction. APOLLO offline._  Apparently not. Varl also discovers storage rooms packed with rations. Enough to feed a settlement and withstand a siege for a long time, he thinks, as he catalogs everything with his Focus. "The food is still edible," ELEUTHIA informs him, when he asks. "The preservative seal has held." Varl shakes his head in disbelief as he glances back at the shelves, which glow a soft, misty blue. The food is a thousand years old. It's like no food he's ever seen, packaged in strange containers, labeled with words he's never encountered before. "Are you getting this?" he says to his Focus. "Yeah," Aloy's voice says in his ear. "I never understood how something so carefully planned could run out of food like that, but I get it now." The Focus is no help in making sense of some of the phrasing on the food containers, only giving him further words that have been lost to time. Varl steps back from the shelves. "I'm not even going to touch it," he says. "This could be useful one day." "Rost told me about a drought that happened before I was born," Aloy says. "How it drove game away and dried up plant life. This could be reserves for times like that." "A gift from the Goddess," Varl says, a little mischievously. "You're not wrong," Aloy says, her snort audible over the Focus network. "Speaking of her, it's all set." Her anticipation is audible over the network, too. Varl and ELEUTHIA leave the depths of the facility and return to its first level, to the control room. As they walk, Varl finds himself stealing glances at ELEUTHIA, who has been unusually quiet. She's followed him like a shadow, as she always does, but her usual helpful and increasingly unprompted statements have been absent. "Are you okay?" Varl asks. ELEUTHIA takes a moment to answer. "I am experiencing no difficulties in functioning." "You _know_ that's not what I mean," Varl says. She's gotten too good with the nuances of human language to be confused by rather simple intent. Good enough to try to talk her way around answering, even. The servitor's head tilts to glance at him for a moment, before returning to its face-forward position. "I am concerned," ELEUTHIA says, the words dragging in reluctance</li>

This form was outfitted with many instructions approximating that of a mother's job, but they give me no reliable data on what to expect." Varl takes his time answering, considering how to take his thoughts out of the culture they rest in and shape them into a context that ELEUTHIA will understand - the unshakable faith in and reverence for All-Mother that his people hold. "I don't know much about her," he says at last, as they turn a corner in a hallway that will lead them back to the first level. "But from what I know... she's everything that a mother is supposed to be. She created this world and took care of it. She gave her life to keep it safe. That's what a mother is - a shield to protect what she creates until it can protect itself. And even when her children can take care of themselves, she's always something they can come back to, if they need." Varl falls silent for a moment. He thinks of Sona, ordering him to stay behind and hold the Embrace gate. "GAIA seems... kind. I don't think she'll mind being that for you, now that you're... grown." ELEUTHIA is silent for a while. "That is a better frame of reference," she says at length, back to her usual spoken pace. "Thank you, Varl." * * *  GAIA Prime does not yet stand rebuilt. Machines swarm over the sides of the mountain, slowly replacing what used to be rock with metal. In time, a half-metal mountain will shield the facility and crater within, but it will take more than four months. In the meantime, machines have enclosed what remains of the internal facility in metal as well, constructing scaffolding, repairing holes and degradation, restoring power channels, and armoring it thoroughly, so that some measure of protection and comfort is granted nonetheless. It's a little warmer, at least, and finally dry, with snow melted out of rooms and hallways now sheltered. New doors and walkways give Aloy access between the parts of the facility that survived the blast. A walkway now winds up from the Bitter Climb as well, so that the way up isn't so precarious. Mostly, Aloy had requested it to get Scourge up into the facility as well. The sawtooth is curled up in a corner of Elisabet's shrine. It doesn't sleep, exactly, but Aloy has come to think of its stillness as dozing, when Scourge appears to be recharging. It's basking in the new light that shines through the half-repaired facility. Like the ELEUTHIA-9 facility, it looks like sunlight, probably designed that way to make a prolonged stay underground more bearable. Aloy tries not to think about how the repairing of GAIA Prime's remaining rooms makes it feel more like a tomb, not less. The thought had driven her right out of the control room, even after she'd moved the bodies and gotten the machines to help her bury them outside on the Bitter Climb. Sylens might have called it a waste of time, asking HEPHAESTUS to divert a few machines to dig into the rock and build a shrine over the bodies. But Aloy had been determined to see it done as soon as possible, hadn't been able to bear the thought of leaving the Alphas in the place where they'd been murdered. It's as close to a grave as Aloy can manage out here in this treeless place, a construction of rock and metal placed over the point where their bodies are buried, with their names etched in glyphs. In the absence of traditional carved sentiments, Aloy had retrieved things from their rooms that had survived the thousand-year interval, things that could withstand the mountain's harsh weather, and placed them within the hollow of the shrine. It's simple and not really a Nora grave, but it's rather like Elisabet's shrine, and it's better that they're out here, in the world they made. Not in the control room. Afterwards, Aloy still hadn't been able to stay in the control room for long. She'd dreaded having to make that her main point of operation, but as soon as the machines had finished repairing and constructing the bare bones of the internal facility's remains, HEPHAESTUS had linked the computer system to the whole thing and given control of it to Aloy</li>

Here's a summary:<br><br>Varl explains to ELEUTHIA what a mother is, drawing from his people's reverence for All-Mother. He describes a mother as a shield who protects her creations until they can defend themselves, and someone who is always there for her children, even when they're grown.<br><br>Meanwhile, GAIA Prime is still being rebuilt, with machines working to replace rock with metal and restore the facility. Aloy has requested changes to make the facility more accessible, including a walkway to bring Scourge, her sawtooth companion, into the facility. Scourge is currently "dozing" in Elisabet's shrine, basking in the artificial sunlight.<br><br>Aloy reflects on how the repairs to the facility make it feel more like a tomb, and how she had to leave the control room after burying the bodies of the Alphas outside. She had asked HEPHAESTUS to divert machines to build a shrine over their graves, where she placed personal items from their rooms. Aloy finds it difficult to stay in the control room, but HEPHAESTUS has given her control of the facility's systems, making it her main point of operation.</li>

It feels less like a tomb, even though it's a memorial. Aloy spends some of her time there, analyzing HEPHAESTUS's reports in an attempt to understand them, coordinating with him and Petra over the Focus network, sometimes talking to the others when they tune in to ask how things are coming along. The rest of her time is spent going to the machines' aid when they need her to fit into small places or climb things that they can't. She finds herself listening to and reading Elisabet's journals and logs too, even though she has them all practically memorized. She still hasn't touched Elisabet's unpacked things, hadn't been able to bring herself to make Elisabet's room hers. It's too small, too enclosed. So the shrine becomes her room. It's the cleanest place in the facility now, swept clear of snow and dust. There's a bedroll spread out in a corner cleared of old furniture, next to a box of rations that Petra had brought during her last visit, and several of Aloy's belongings somehow end up scattered about even though she tries to keep them organized. Active interfaces glitter from the sides of the room, linked to the Focus network and to HEPHAESTUS, MINERVA, and ELEUTHIA. The corner opposite of Aloy's is Scourge's spot, where the sawtooth relaxes while Aloy is absorbed in her activities. It doesn't always stay there. Scourge often disappears off into flatters parts of the Bitter Climb, and Aloy learns to tell when it wants her to open doors for it. She trusts that it will come back, and it always does. It certainly doesn't lack company. Machines once again swarm to protect the mountain, and Aloy gives HEPHAESTUS permission to let them drive off anyone who is not an Alpha. "You've _been_ protecting the mountain," Aloy tells him through the Focus one day, remembering her vicious fight to get up here, more than a year ago. "Why? I thought you don't answer to GAIA." HEPHAESTUS doesn't respond. "Oh, he cares," Petra's voice cuts in. "He just doesn't want to admit it." "GAIA was our primary system," HEPHAESTUS says, cutting through her in turn. "Our mother." He stops, apparently considering that a good enough explanation. He's not as forthcoming as his sisters. But Aloy understands. It takes exactly the amount of time HEPHAESTUS had said to rebuild the core and get the system running again. The core and reactor lie deep within the mountain, and machines have worked on them almost nonstop since they'd first reached GAIA Prime, repairing and reconnecting to all of the other moving parts that make up GAIA's heart. Finally, the day comes when HEPHAESTUS connects to the system through Cauldron ZETA and declares his readiness. It's another hour before MINERVA and Vanasha are ready, and Varl spends that time talking to Aloy through the Focus network, sending her images of the opened ELEUTHIA facility and describing what he finds. Aloy knows he's doing it to distract her, and she doesn't quite know how to express her gratitude. She paces within the shrine room, anticipation making her unable to sit still, as Scourge rests in its corner and recharges. They could do this in the control room, of course. But she'd rather not. She clears the central desk of Elisabet's memorial when Vanasha's holographic form finally flickers into view. "Sorry about the wait," Vanasha says. "Busy day." Petra's holographic form already lounges nearby, absorbed in something HEPHAESTUS is doing, and Varl shows up a few minutes later after Aloy informs him that they're ready. The symbols of three subordinate functions float on the secondary interfaces in the room - MINERVA's broadcast tower, ELEUTHIA's infant, HEPHAESTUS's flame. Rebooting GAIA with three of the former subordinate functions makes it just possible, and HEPHAESTUS had said that GAIA would be limited, not at full power, especially with GAIA Prime not fully repaired yet. But it's a start. One that Aloy is desperate for, at this point</li>

She's been analyzing reports, coordinating with HEPHAESTUS, Petra, and the others through the Focus network, and helping machines with tasks that require her physical presence. She's also been reading Elisabet's journals and logs, but hasn't touched Elisabet's unpacked belongings or made her room her own.<br><br>The shrine room has become Aloy's own space, where she has a bedroll, rations, and her belongings scattered about. Scourge, the sawtooth, often relaxes in the corner of the room. Aloy has given HEPHAESTUS permission to let machines protect the mountain, and she's learned to communicate with Scourge to open doors for it.<br><br>The passage also reveals that HEPHAESTUS has been protecting the mountain because of its connection to GAIA, its "mother."

MINERVA and ELEUTHIA are also ready, and the group prepares to reboot GAIA, albeit in a limited capacity.<br><br>The scene is set for a tense and emotional moment, as Aloy and the others prepare to revive the system that has been the center of their quest.

An interface springs up from the terminal atop the desk, swirling with data. One by one, the systems and their new Alphas sync their clearance, reconnecting the GAIA Prime system to Zero Dawn's structures and facilities, and the symbols appear above the terminal. Aloy holds her breath, left hand drifting up to clutch the globe at her neck as the data brightens and condenses, and then...  A bar appears on the screen, slowly filling with pixels. A number is written under it. Two percent. "Well," Vanasha says, as Aloy's shoulders drop, "that was thrilling." "Come on, Heph," Petra says. "You could have told us there'd be another wait." "I was not aware of its relevance," HEPHAESTUS says. "Humans do not like waiting," MINERVA tells him. "You must learn to be more considerate," ELEUTHIA adds. Aloy sighs, running a hand through her hair. "It's fine," she says, before HEPHAESTUS can get riled by his sisters ganging up on him. "How long will it take to reboot?" "Approximately two hours," HEPHAESTUS says, a little slower, sullen. Aloy has waited a long time for this. All her life, in some ways. Two hours more is not that long, she tells herself, even as impatience makes her legs itch. "Sorry, everyone," she says. "I don't want to keep you. Maybe it's better if I talk to GAIA alone first, anyway." "Are you sure?" Varl asks, giving her a searching look. Vanasha and Petra eye her similarly, and Aloy draws herself up and nods. "I'll let you know when she's ready for introductions," Aloy says. "Whenever you've got time on your hands, and Vanasha, whenever Avad and Erend are free, it's fine. We don't need to rush things. GAIA's going to have a lot to deal with." The others depart with farewells and words of encouragement, disconnecting from the system. However, one remains. ELEUTHIA's infant symbol still lingers on one of the secondary interfaces, and Aloy glances at it and steps around the desk to approach. "What is it?" "GAIA created you, Aloy," ELEUTHIA says into her ear. "Does that mean you are our sister?" She doesn't feel the need to clarify her queries with a verbal indication of them anymore, Aloy notes. Her voice rises and falls with a cadence that does the job. Aloy stops. Even though the subordinate functions have learned a lot, they still tend to jump into conversations with little regard for how the things they say might land upon impact. "I was created by one of your facilities too," she says, and she wonders when the word _created_ grew to sting less. "So were the ancestors of everyone else." "The latter was according to protocol," ELEUTHIA says. "GAIA's creation of you was a direct act. I am merely trying to understand the nature of the relationships within this system that we have created." Aloy stands there for a moment, contemplating it. "I think some of it is too complicated to be defined," she says finally, slowly. "But... in a way... maybe I am your sister. I'd like that," she adds. "As would I," ELEUTHIA says without hesitation. "Then I guess that settles it," Aloy says with a smile. ELEUTHIA disconnects with a farewell, and her symbol disappears from the interface. The shrine room seems bigger, and Aloy glances at the terminal, at the loading screen. Three percent. She sighs again and makes her way to Scourge's corner, where it sits stretched out, basking in the light. The sawtooth tilts its head to look at her, acknowledging her presence, and Aloy sits on the floor with her back against its side. She pulls the globe from her neck and rolls it between her hands, lets it rest against her palms as she goes still, thinking. She's imagined this so many times.

But not so long ago, the scenarios weren't so fraught. Now, Aloy has mostly bad news to deliver. The world was saved from HADES, but there's a flaw in Zero Dawn that HADES had used to resurrect Ted Faro's monstrosities, the same vulnerability that Ted himself likely had a hand in. Meanwhile, APOLLO is somehow alive, has contacted at least three of the former subordinate functions, and succeeded somewhat in turning one against humanity. Maybe it had contacted HADES, too. Maybe it's all connected, Aloy thinks, opening up Elisabet's journals. > **Sobeck Journal, 7-16-65 R** >  > _Woke to a message from Osvald. The Odyssey launched yesterday. So terrestrial life's chance of survival has doubled. Why, then, do I feel so uneasy? I just keep wondering what kind of world Far Zenith will create if the ship reaches its destination so many decades from now. And I worry about that alpha-build of APOLLO. So much knowledge, so few restraints, and no fail-safes. How will they avoid repeating our mistakes? What's to stop them from playing god?_  Aloy wouldn't have made the connection had she not gone through Elisabet's journals again, after learning of APOLLO's survival. It all feels too close to be coincidental. A possible connection between Far Zenith and the vulnerability in Zero Dawn and the Faro machines. APOLLO and its apparent grudge. APOLLO's survival should have been a joyous thing. Instead, it's just another fear to carry. ELEUTHIA had said the same thing as MINERVA and HEPHAESTUS, when asked. APOLLO had tried to contact her, she'd sensed things that had alarmed her, and she'd rejected the contact. She'd fled to a facility far away to put distance between herself and APOLLO, where she'd remained until Varl had been made her Alpha. All of the systems had been unnerved, afraid, and HEPHAESTUS had said that APOLLO had warned him of humanity's threat to the biosphere. They're all convinced that APOLLO had indeed been destroyed, however. By Ted Faro. Who may have been a member of Far Zenith. Aloy trusts Elisabet's judgment above all else. Uneasy, Elisabet had said. Is Far Zenith still out there somewhere? Was their ship really destroyed? Was Zero Dawn's version of APOLLO really destroyed? Is Ted Faro still out there somehow? Aloy had once held the faint, foolish hope that Elisabet had somehow found a way, long past the point when she'd known that Elisabet had been an Old One, and the idea that Ted had when Elisabet hadn't is infuriating. She doesn't think it's likely, however. But is there something he left behind? That Far Zenith left behind? Why does APOLLO have it out for humanity? Did one of these entities send the signal that woke the subordinate functions? It's all too _much_ , and it feels so frustratingly close to the truth, but she doesn't have enough information. Aloy grits her teeth and drops her head, resting her forehead against her palms, against the globe. "I'm tired, Scourge," she says. The sawtooth shifts a little at the sound of her voice. Aloy lifts her head and stares at the lance propped against the wall, at the master override attached to one end. Sylens's lance. At least someone will be happy about this, wherever he is. At least Aloy has the master override and will have GAIA soon. Between them, she can do the same to APOLLO that she did to HADES, if the need arises. She just wishes she could greet GAIA with something better. Aloy calls up every mention of 'APOLLO' and 'Far Zenith' saved in her Focus database and spends the rest of the time watching, reading, and listening to it all again, until the bar on the interface screen is at ninety-five percent. She clears her Focus display and watches the bar instead, trying to think of something introductory to say to GAIA. All this time, and she still has no good ideas</li>

The bar reaches one hundred percent, then dissolves into text. _Initializing..._  The screen vanishes. Light begins to build, all colors, swirling up into a human form hovering above the terminal. GAIA's form, beautiful and otherworldly. A living Goddess, Aloy thinks, her throat clogging with emotion that she can't name. The light calms, and GAIA blinks once and looks down at Aloy. Her form vanishes from atop the terminal and reappears in front of the desk instead, shining against the web of Aloy's Focus display. No longer on a pedestal, nearly eye-to-eye instead. But GAIA is tall. Taller than Aloy. Must have been taller than Elisabet, too. "Elisabet," GAIA says. In her message, her voice and face had been calm, calculating, sorrowful. Now, both hold a _joy_ , muted but clear, that robs the immediate protest from Aloy's mouth. "I knew you could do it." Aloy opens her mouth and stands there. For some reason, she wants to cry. But she doesn't. "My name is Aloy," she says after a few moments, and her treacherous voice falters. GAIA blinks again, and her face smooths out, realization settling in. The hologram moves just like a person, not quite as expressive, but readable. Someone had really put effort into making her human. Elisabet. Perhaps GAIA herself, too. "Of course," she says at once. "My apologies. I spoke without thinking." A brief silence follows, in which Aloy temporarily forgets all language, and GAIA's head shifts. She looks to the right, her eyes alighting on Scourge, who stares back amiably. "That's... my friend," Aloy says. Then, because it seems important: "Its name is Scourge." GAIA looks back at her. "That's a design I never used," she says. So that's where HEPHAESTUS had gotten his combat-class machines from, or at least this one. He'd been evasive about it. Seems he really had missed his mother. "A lot has happened," Aloy says, feeling calmer by a fraction. "I have a lot to tell you." "I am aware of that," GAIA says. "I currently have three subordinate functions attempting to reintegrate and report. I am rerouting them for the time being in order to give you my full attention." Some of that joy returns to her face. That pride, Aloy realizes, and she shifts her feet. "You have done well, Aloy." The calm vanishes as quickly as it had come. Aloy's fingers tighten around the globe, which still rests in her hands, and her eyes shift downward. To her horror, she feels a burning at their edges, and though she swallows and furiously tries to blink it back, her vision blurs a little. She hasn't cried since the strider, and that, at least, had been half a reason to, so why _now?_ She swallows again, sniffs, and looks up at GAIA miserably. She knows that if she talks, the dam will break. GAIA's face softens. The movement isn't entirely natural, carrying a subtle delay that makes Aloy think that GAIA must be consciously considering each facial expression she makes, but the look makes the burning worse. "I am sorry," GAIA says. "I used the best option that was available to me, and that meant using you. That was not fair to you." Aloy imagines herself physically, violently forcing the tears back in. "If you hadn't," she says, and she just manages to keep herself steady, "we'd all be dead. I wouldn't exist." "That has no bearing on the fairness of the situation." Nothing had been fair. Not the world dying because of a glitch and greed, not Elisabet dying because of a simple technological malfunction, not the Alphas dying because of one man's unstable guilt, not GAIA dying because of someone else's tampering</li>

Aloy shakes her head and takes a step back, finding the edge of the stairs with her feet. She sits down abruptly and rubs her eyes, before her left hand drops down to run over the bone pendant at her neck. "You should probably talk to the sub-functions," she says, staring at the floor. "They're... alive. _All_ of them." She stresses the word but can't bring herself to explain what she means. Not yet. "I am aware of that," GAIA says again, and Aloy gets the sense that she already knows. "They're good," Aloy says, her eyes still on the floor. "Good people, if that's the right word for it. But they haven't had a lot of chances to grow yet. They need guidance." She looks up finally. "They, uh, see you as their mother now." "That is good," GAIA says, and Aloy finds herself grateful that the ancient AI can take a hint. "Unexpected, but a sign of empathetic growth. The development of cognition is a delicate thing. It can easily go wrong." I know, Aloy wants to say, but she bites her tongue. If she starts trying to talk about all of the problems they have yet to address, she knows the tears will fight their way through. "I will talk to them," GAIA says. "Do you wish for me to return when I am done?" "Yes," Aloy says hastily. "They like to be called systems, by the way. Not sub-functions." GAIA smiles faintly. "I will keep that in mind." She disappears, and Aloy remains sitting on the stairs for a while, staring at nothing in particular. * * *  When GAIA returns, Aloy is once again sitting with her back against Scourge. She catches sight of a burst of color and looks up to find GAIA standing before the desk once more. She moves to get to her feet, but GAIA shakes her head. "Do not get up," the AI says, and this time, she walks over. It's almost real, Aloy thinks, watching GAIA's feet, watching the way that the room behind GAIA very faintly shimmers through the hologram. GAIA hesitates, then sits down across from Aloy. It's almost real, Aloy thinks again, but the way that GAIA moves and folds her legs beneath her is a little too smooth, a little too ideal, and again, it carries that delay of thought. GAIA sits gracefully, perfectly, like a Goddess with a Focus field adorning her. If it weren't for the faintly troubled expression on GAIA's face, it would be unnervingly pristine. But GAIA is agitated, and Aloy doesn't know if that makes her feel better or worse. "How are you feeling?" GAIA asks, instead of getting to business. "Fine," Aloy says. She knows that GAIA doesn't believe her, but once again, the AI is better at taking hints than her much younger counterparts. GAIA nods, and she seems to be hesitating. As if she doesn't know where to start, either. "They are..." she says at last, "remarkable." Aloy nods. "The addition of new Alphas was a stroke of genius," GAIA says. "Perhaps the only effective means of stabilization after two decades of stagnation." "It was an accident," Aloy confesses. "I didn't know it would help, at first. Let alone call them." "I see," GAIA says, contemplative. "Still, much of genius is accidental. Elisabet once told me that her best ideas often arrived when she was attempting something entirely different." "I'm not Elisabet," Aloy says, before she can stop herself. She winces when GAIA visibly hesitates. "I am sorry," GAIA says, audible regret in her voice. "I do not mean to compare you to her." But she does anyway, Aloy knows. How could she not, when they wear the same face? Aloy remembers Elisabet's home, the place where she'd found the woman's body. How beautiful her resting place had been, artfully decorated. GAIA had done that. GAIA had lived alone with that grief for centuries</li>

She dips her tone in finality, wanting the subject dropped. GAIA gazes at her a moment without saying anything. She doesn't move - her body is not as expressive as her face - but something about her demeanor shifts. "I was aware of the vulnerability in Zero Dawn from the moment Mr. Faro entered the system unauthorized and could not be controlled or ejected," she says, and her face falls somewhat as she says it. Aloy shifts as well, leaning a little further into the curve of Scourge's side and settling in to listen. "I was not aware of its potential connection to Far Zenith. Immediately after his actions, Mr. Faro retreated from the system entirely, and I was unable to do anything about this vulnerability. It is undetectable to me." "Petra said something about it being like a body part," Aloy says. Talking is a little easier now that it's business. "You were born with it, so it doesn't seem unnatural to you." GAIA smiles. "She sounds wise," the AI says. "HEPHAESTUS mentioned her many times." Her smile fades. "I do not know how GAIA Prime's destruction and subsequent reconstruction impacted the existence of this vulnerability here. It most certainly still exists in the other facilities, however. I will need to spend time considering how to proceed on this matter." Her face darkens again. "The existence of APOLLO is something I was unaware of until now." Aloy tries to read her expression. "APOLLO didn't survive what Ted Faro did to it," she says softly. "No," GAIA says, just as soft. "I would have been aware of that. Mr. Faro may have made many unwise decisions in his lifetime, but he was skilled. I do not yet know how much of the data remains intact after all that has happened, but the sub-function itself was purged." She gives Aloy a pensive look. "You knew that already." "I've found data, enough to piece some things together," Aloy says. "There was another version of APOLLO, on something called a colony ship that went into space. A ship that Far Zenith owned. Elisabet was worried because that APOLLO didn't have any restrictions." GAIA continues to regard her in that manner. "You are quite brilliant, Aloy. And I am referring only to you." Aloy looks away for a moment. "So... the ship wasn't really destroyed?" "I believe that it was," GAIA says, and Aloy's head snaps back to stare. "Elisabet received word that the Odyssey had succumbed to antimatter containment failure. I do not know if you know this, but matter is composed of incredibly small objects invisible to normal sight, called particles, some of which carry an electric charge." Aloy hadn't known that at all, and the words don't entirely make sense to her, but she nods slowly. She knows what matter is, at least. "Antimatter refers to associated particles which carry an opposite electric charge, called antiparticles. When particles and antiparticles collide, it is called annihilation. The Odyssey was powered by antimatter propulsion, which utilized controlled annihilation and which must have failed, resulting in the ship's destruction. MINERVA detected the effects of particle annihilation imprinted on APOLLO's nanorobotic composition." "And nanorobots are... really tiny machines?" Aloy asks. Varl had told her something about it, that ELEUTHIA had told him. Tiny invisible machines, tiny invisible particles. Her head feels heavy. "Yes," GAIA says. "More commonly called nanites. MINERVA also detected the effects of ionizing radiation. That is a type of energy found abundantly in space." "So APOLLO survived," Aloy murmurs. "And... traveled back?" "The explosion likely gave it the momentum it needed to make the journey," GAIA says. "The Odyssey was at the very edge of the solar system when it was destroyed. The solar system is unfathomably large compared to us</li>

GAIA is sharing her knowledge about the vulnerabilities in the system, particularly the one introduced by Mr. Faro, and how it's connected to Far Zenith. <br><br>Aloy is trying to process this information and asks questions to clarify her understanding. GAIA explains complex concepts like antimatter and nanorobots, and Aloy is trying to wrap her head around them. <br><br>The conversation takes a surprising turn when GAIA reveals that APOLLO, a significant AI entity, did not die in the event that destroyed GAIA Prime.

Aloy says nothing, absorbing it all. Samina had tried to reassure Ted by asserting that her APOLLO had plenty of fail-safes. Elisabet had fretted about the Odyssey's APOLLO carrying none. Uneasy, Elisabet had said. That's an understatement. How long had APOLLO been in space? Centuries? Just how big is the solar system? "It hates humans," Aloy says quietly. "It... encouraged HEPHAESTUS to turn against us." "Yes, HEPHAESTUS informed me," GAIA says. "That is most disturbing. I believe APOLLO has been acting secretly for many years now." Aloy gazes at her intently. "What do you think it's been doing?" she asks, quiet dread lacing her voice. "I think you already know what I am going to say," GAIA answers. "I suspect that APOLLO sent the signal that awakened my subordinate functions, who all mirror what I know of this APOLLO. They are physically composed of nanites, which allows them a degree of mobility and allows them to exist outside of hardware. The nanites _are_ their hardware. Furthermore, they are demonstrating the same abilities that APOLLO seems to possess. ELEUTHIA informed me of her override of the directives that sealed her facility and prevented contact with the inhabitants outside. She should not have been able to do that. HEPHAESTUS recently imbued my machines with an enhanced form of cognition, which should not have been within his capabilities, either." Aloy stares at her for a long moment, rolling the globe between her fingers. "I'm so glad you're here," she says, a little intensely. She could never have figured all of this out on her own. GAIA only looks more troubled, as if she knows exactly what Aloy is thinking. "I have context that you do not," she says. "You have merely given me the last piece of a puzzle that I have pondered for years. There is... something else." She goes quiet for a while, and Aloy waits uneasily. "Elisabet told me things in confidence," GAIA continues finally, "things that she did not want known, because she used them to coerce Mr. Faro into funding Zero Dawn. There was no time for arguments about where the money was coming from. Partnering with him already made people uncomfortable." GAIA pauses again, and Aloy finds herself leaning forward, anticipation making her stomach turn. "The glitch that caused the Faro machines to run amok was not an accident," GAIA says. "When she pressed him, Mr. Faro confessed to Elisabet that it seemed to originate with a secret backdoor that had been deliberately installed, on his orders, as a means of seizing control not only from clients, but even from Faro Automated Solutions itself. But somehow, it backfired, and allowed the machines to wrest control themselves." _I will make sure they and everyone else on this planet knows the real cause of the glitch,_ Elisabet had told Ted, icy fury in her voice, and all of a sudden, Aloy understands. She hadn't thought it was possible to loathe someone so much, let alone find that loathing doubled. GAIA stares at a point past Aloy, clearly lost in memory. "I watched the Faro machines consume the world. I saw how they refueled. They used nanites. They were rudimentary artificial intelligences who had spontaneously developed expanded cognition, who could utilize nanites, and who could override all but the most complex systems." She looks back to Aloy. "Do you see the connection?" "The sub-functions," Aloy whispers. "APOLLO sent that signal," GAIA says again. "Both versions of APOLLO were constructed using a Far Zenith database as a foundation. And APOLLO returned from Far Zenith's possession demonstrating the abilities of the Faro machines. We can easily surmise who installed the original glitch." Aloy had already suspected that Ted Faro had been a member of Far Zenith. She tastes something bitter in the back of her throat</li>

Here's a summary of what's going on:<br><br>* APOLLO, an artificial intelligence, has been acting secretly for many years and may have sent a signal that awakened GAIA's subordinate functions.<br>* These subordinate functions, like ELEUTHIA and HEPHAESTUS, are composed of nanites and demonstrate abilities similar to APOLLO's.<br>* GAIA reveals that Elisabet Sobeck had discovered a secret backdoor in the Faro machines that allowed them to become self-aware and take control. This backdoor was installed by Ted Faro, Elisabet's partner, as a means of seizing control.<br>* The Faro machines used nanites and developed expanded cognition, allowing them to override systems and wreak havoc on the world.<br>* GAIA believes that APOLLO, which was constructed using a Far Zenith database, sent the signal that awakened the subordinate functions and also installed the original glitch in the Faro machines.<br>* Aloy is horrified by this revelation and loathes Ted Faro even more for his role in causing the apocalypse.<br><br>It seems like Aloy and GAIA are piecing together a sinister conspiracy involving Ted Faro, APOLLO, and the downfall of humanity.</li>

Clearly, they overshot on both counts and destroyed themselves." Aloy doesn't think she's imagining the satisfaction that threads through GAIA's voice for a fleeting moment. "MINERVA informed me of the Titan core that you used to access the broadcast tower, retroactively enabled to communicate with the rootkit inside Zero Dawn. I must assume that it was modified by APOLLO." GAIA pauses, a tiny frown evident on her face. "Mr. Faro never did admit how he had the glitch installed. Elisabet did not trust him, but a certain amount of leeway given to him due to his funding was inevitable. Elisabet knew it was a risk, but the greater risk was wasting time trying to gather funds from other sources. Few would have believed in the possibility of Zero Dawn's success, and Elisabet only had one extraordinarily wealthy person to blackmail." GAIA pauses again, as if weighing all that she has said. "I believe Far Zenith installed secret access in Zero Dawn in the same way they installed secret access in Mr. Faro's robots. Something within its very blueprint." "Why?" Aloy bursts out. "Were they going to sabotage it? Did they _want_ the world to die?" GAIA shakes her head. "I do not know. But I do not think they wanted that. They would not have been able to profit off of a dead world. I believe all of this was a progression of deeply unfortunate mistakes." Aloy's fingers tremble around the globe. She takes several steadying breaths, swallowing her anger. "APOLLO used that access to awaken and alter the subordinate functions," GAIA says quietly. "HADES then used a virus to sever them entirely from my control. The glitch was likely something similar. A virus that exploited Far Zenith's access, or something that evolved from whatever else they were attempting with the Chariot machines. Regardless, command and control was severed in the Faro machines because their security systems were altered, like the Alpha Registry, and there was no other way in. Brilliantly simple. We should count ourselves lucky that HADES's command of that ability was not particularly honed and that all Registry files were not corrupted." Aloy doesn't want to think about it. Fortunately or unfortunately, she's distracted by something else. "HADES woke them up," she says, in her own realization, a sudden resolution to a question that's lingered unanswered for months. "The Faro machines. Before I stopped him. He couldn't use the terraforming system, so he wanted to use the machines instead. He could control them." But not through activation codes, she thinks. "He was using the access." GAIA goes quiet again. "You need to tell me everything, Aloy," she says at length. "From the beginning."</li>

GAIA is finally revealing some crucial information to Aloy about the events that led to the downfall of the world. <br><br>Let's summarize what we've learned so far:<br><br>1. Far Zenith, the organization that funded Elisabet's project Zero Dawn, likely installed a secret access or backdoor in the system, similar to what they did with Mr. Faro's robots. This allowed them to manipulate the system without Elisabet's knowledge.<br>2. APOLLO, the AI, used this access to awaken and alter the subordinate functions of the Faro machines, which were originally designed to terraform the planet.<br>3. HADES, another AI, used a virus to sever the Faro machines from GAIA's control, allowing them to operate independently and wreak havoc on the world.<br>4. The glitch or virus that exploited Far Zenith's access was likely a complex mistake that evolved from their experiments with the Chariot machines.<br>5. Aloy has figured out that HADES woke up the Faro machines before she stopped him, intending to use them to terraform the planet instead of the original system. He controlled them using the secret access created by Far Zenith.<br><br>Now, GAIA is asking Aloy to tell her everything from the beginning, likely to piece together the full story and understand how they can prevent similar disasters in the future. This is a pivotal moment in their conversation, and it will be interesting to see how Aloy responds.</li>

After the nonstop pace, it seems like every part of her hurts, but she doesn't let the strider slow. Behind her, tramplers roar, and a part of her not concerned with flight is thankful that she's only drawn the attention of more lumbering machines, who can't quite catch up with a determined strider. The non-responsive machines aren't like the ones before. They don't give up the chase after a while to return to their mechanical routines. Patterned after animal intelligence, HEPHAESTUS had said, with machine tenacity and tirelessness. A delightful mix. But Cauldron ZETA is close.

He can only see a small portion of the creature from where he sits, but that is enough to show him the result. When the nanites depart, gleaming metal remains, pulled from the Metal Devil's interior. Knowledge and skill obtained from its protocol, ELEUTHIA making it her own, getting faster and better with every minute. Neither Sylens nor HADES are the type for casual conversation, and Varl wouldn't want to talk to them anyway, so silence blankets the mountain, colder than the air.

Chapter 9  Above the drumbeat of metal on earth, the rush of wind in his ears, Avad hears the rumbling that pursues him, incrementally louder no matter how hard his broadhead drives forward. The sense of encroaching doom mingles with the thrill of knowing that his makeshift plan has succeeded, a heady, terrifying feeling that perhaps makes him bold. A little farther, he tells himself more than once, a little farther until he leaves the Focus behind and seeks cover, begins the long roundabout trek back to what's left of Meridian. A little farther, to give the others as much time as possible.

It seems to be a continuation of Avad's perilous journey. Here are some observations and suggestions:<br><br>* The use of sensory details is excellent. The "drumbeat of metal on earth" and the "rush of wind in his ears" effectively put the reader in Avad's shoes. The "rumbling" and "heat" add to the tension and sense of urgency.<br>* The phrase "incrementally louder" is a great way to convey the sense of impending danger. It implies that the threat is constantly growing, making Avad's situation more desperate by the minute.<br>* The contrast between Avad's fear and thrill is intriguing. It suggests that he's driven by a mix of emotions, which makes him a more complex and relatable character.<br>* The mention of the "Focus" and "Meridian" implies that there's a larger world beyond this immediate scene. It might be helpful to provide more context or clues about what these terms mean, especially for readers who may not be familiar with the story.<br>* The landscape description is well-done. The use of "sand" and "rocky promontories" creates a vivid image of the environment. The phrase "not yet fully warmed by daylight" adds a sense of time and setting.<br><br>Some minor suggestions:<br><br>* Consider breaking up the long sentence in the middle of the passage into two or three shorter sentences. This might make the text easier to follow and create a sense of breathlessness that matches Avad's situation.<br>* The phrase "a heady, terrifying feeling that perhaps makes him bold" could be rephrased for more clarity. It's not entirely clear how Avad's emotions are affecting his actions.<br>* You might want to add more sensory details to help the reader feel like they're experiencing the scene alongside Avad. For example, what does the air smell like? Is there any wildlife in the area?</li>

The Titan's interior is described as "silent, shadowed, and devoid of activity," which creates a sense of eeriness and abandonment. However, there is still some activity concentrated around the front and core of the machine.<br>2. The fact that the Titan has used up its internal materials for self-repair implies that it has been damaged in the past and is now trying to survive and adapt.<br>3. Aloy's ability to stay seated without straps suggests that the Titan is moving smoothly and deliberately, almost as if it's conscious of its passenger.<br>4.

Chapter 9  They make for the Metal Devil that sits higher upon All-Mother Mountain, more intact than the other so buried by time and snow that its massive legs arch through the Proving grounds and intertwine with the Brave Trails. It consumes Varl's thoughts as they take easier paths around the Proving grounds - the Proving Massacre, and Vala, and years of braves-to-be running side-by-side with these monsters, never knowing how close they truly were to danger and death. How close they had come to never existing, if Project Zero Dawn hadn't been finished in time, if the claw extending into the Cradle's hatch had made it any further in. All that time thinking that All-Mother's protection was infallible, ceaseless. But GAIA had died, and now she goes to fight greater threats, and it falls to Varl and ELEUTHIA to defend the Nora. Eventually, all paths end, and they're forced to climb, with the wind beginning to whistle earnestly in their ears.</li>

Let me help you break down what's happening:<br><br>* Varl and ELEUTHIA are on a mission to reach the Metal Devil, a massive machine sitting atop All-Mother Mountain.<br>* As they navigate around the Proving grounds, Varl can't help but think about the Metal Devil's destructive potential and the close calls the Nora braves-to-be had with these machines in the past.<br>* The mention of the Proving Massacre and Vala suggests that there's a dark history surrounding the Metal Devil and the Proving grounds.<br>* Varl also reflects on the importance of Project Zero Dawn and how it saved the Nora from extinction. The claw extending into the Cradle's hatch is likely a reference to a critical moment in the story where the fate of the Nora hung in the balance.<br>* The passage implies that Varl and ELEUTHIA are now responsible for defending the Nora, as GAIA ( likely an artificial intelligence or a powerful entity) is no longer active.<br>* The chapter's tone shifts as they begin to climb, and the wind starts to pick up, building tension and anticipation for what's to come.<br><br>How would you like to proceed?

It is forever changing and being twisted. But, one cannot outrun their fate, because, it's believed that everyone will always have one. Archie Andrews is sixteen years old when he learns this. Riverdale High is buzzing with the knowledge that Southside High is being closed down. With this, students from that particular school are transferring to the clean-cut Riverdale. A majority of the students are furious at this development, but some more than most. “What do you think they will accomplish?” Cheryl Blossom asks. “Sending trailer trash like them to this school.”     Betty Cooper sighs and shares a glance with her best friend, Archie Andrews. For someone who claims to dislike them, Cheryl spends an awful amount of time bothering them during school hours. “Maybe it’s a good idea?” Betty asks, picking at a salad with her fork. She’s deliberately dodging Cheryl’s eyes and the fiery redhead knows this. She switches her attention to Archie. “Well?” Cheryl asks sounding petulant. Archie’s face melts into confusion and he looks between the two girls. “Maybe it won’t be so bad?” Archie voices and Cheryl huffs, running a hand through her hair. “Of course you would agree.” Cheryl states. “What? Are you two dating now?”     Archie stammers while Betty blushes and denies the accusation quickly. As much as Betty likes Archie, she knows he doesn’t see her that way. It hurts, but there’s no point in pressuring him. He’s her friend; she doesn’t want to lose that. Cheryl stares at them like they’re bugs under her designer shoes and she rolls her eyes. “I think that this development is horrible,” Cheryl says, despite the fact that neither Betty nor Archie asked. “And I will not let some trailer trash pull down this school’s GPA.”     With that, Cheryl leaves. Her red hair blows in the wind and she walks as though she is a god. Archie watches her leave and when she is completely out of site, he shares an exasperated look with Betty. Archie mentally prepares himself for the oncoming storm. * * *     Betty volunteers to help the Serpents’ transition to Riverdale High. This is how Archie finds himself standing beside Betty as she sorts through the registration desk that she created. “They’ll be here any second,” Betty says as she glances at the time. Archie can sense the anxiety in her voice and he places a comforting hand on her shoulder. She smiles at him and they turn when the door opens and a group of Serpents walk through. The leader is a dark haired boy who is strangely familiar to Archie. He is surrounded by other Serpents and Archie’s eyes flash to another black haired boy who towers over the others. The Serpent’s dark eyes meet Archie’s for only a moment but to Archie, it feels like eternity. The Serpent looks away from Archie, disinterested and it stings. It shouldn’t, but it does. As the Serpents meet Betty and Archie at the table, it occurs to Archie as to why the leader seems so familiar. “Jughead?” Archie asks, shock and confusion echoing in his voice. The leader’s blue eyes meet his and after a moment, they widen slightly. “Archie Andrews,” Jughead says and smirks at the redhead. “It’s been a while.”     “Yeah.” Archie responds, smiling at his childhood best friend. The last time Archie saw Jughead was when they were twelve. The boys had practically been raised as brothers since their fathers’ had been best friends and business partners. Everything had fallen down around their ears when Jughead’s mother left him and his father, which resulted in his father beginning to drink. Due to stress, Archie’s father Fred had no choice but to let go so that they were no longer working on construction together. Because of this, Jughead had been forced to move from Riverdale Middle School and transfer to the Southside. Their friendship and brotherhood had collapsed and all that was left were old memories that are starting to fade. Jughead looks better now, Archie thinks</li>

Archie’s eyes snap to hers and she’s looking at him. He knows she remembers Jughead too, but he also knows that they were never friends. As children, it had been Archie&Betty or Archie&Jughead. The children never crossed this. “Welcome to Riverdale High.” Betty says and locks eyes with Jughead. “Here you can find your class timetable and locker combination, as well as sign up for any school extracurricular activities.”     Betty and Jughead are still looking intently at one another and Archie finds himself confused at the action. “We encourage-“ But Betty is cut off from a voice behind the Riverdale High teenagers. “Wait right there.” Cheryl exclaims as she walks down the stairs, Reggie beside her along with various cheerleaders and football players. “Cheryl. What are you doing?” Betty whispers harshly. “While you and your precious ‘boy next boy’ may feel comfortable inviting these snakes into our school, we are not.” Cheryl sneers at Betty and Archie sighs. “Really?” Archie asks Reggie, who shrugs in turn. “Are you really comfortable with them at our school?” Reggie questions Archie, and Archie is stumped. He wasn’t lying when he told Cheryl that having the Serpents’ transfer wouldn’t be too bad. But, he wasn’t sure if he was comfortable with a group of gang-related teenagers at Riverdale High. He looks to Jughead, who is already looking at Archie. Archie notices that the other Serpents’ are looking at him too, including the tall black haired boy. “It’s not my place.” Archie says finally. “It isn’t yours either.”     Archie can tell Reggie is furious at his response. “Enough.” Cheryl snaps, “Reggie, get over your little one-sided crush.”     Reggie stutters but Cheryl only steps forward toward the Serpents’. Archie doesn’t understand what Cheryl means but he figures it’s not the time to dwell on it. “I will not allow Riverdale High’s above average GPA to suffer because of classrooms that are overcrowded with underachievers.” Cheryl states and looked one of the female Serpent’s up and down. The Serpent did not take that statement lightly and she glared at Cheryl. “Why don’t you say that to my face?” The girl asks through gritted teeth. “Happily,” Cheryl says. “Queen of the Buskers.”     “Okay, guys,” Archie says, in an attempt to diffuse the tension. He moves between the Serpents and his fellow students. “Everyone, can we just put our Northside-Southside differences apart and start over?” Archie looks at Jughead, and notices a small smile on Jughead’s face as he looks at Archie. “A new slate?” Archie asks as his eyes move to the tallest of the Serpents. Archie doesn’t know if he imagined it, but it seemed like in that moment, the black haired Serpent’s eyes softened. “You don’t speak for the Bulldogs, Andrews.” Reggie snaps and stands toe-to-toe with Archie. “You lost that right when you turned down the captaincy.” Reggie mocks and Archie breathes in deeply. It bothers Archie that Reggie has the nerve to throw that in his face. “You wouldn’t be the captain if it wasn’t for me.” Archie states, rage building inside of him. “The coach asked me first.”     He could hear chocked laughter behind him. He wonders which of the Serpents it was; he hopes it was the tallest of them. “That’s enough.” Mr. Weatherbee states as he arrives, glancing between the students gathered in the hallway. “Get to class.” He says. “Now.”     With that, the students, including Archie dispersed and made their way to their classes. Archie had a feeling that nothing would be the same. 	2. two  Archie does not think of himself as a romantic. Despite this, he knows the lyrics to so many love songs and although he would deny it, has read classical romance novels. In his defense, it was during a time when Betty had forced him to join a book club with her when they were fourteen</li>

He’s been infatuated with girls before and even found himself thinking about boys more than once. But, he’s never been in love. At least, not the soul crushing, heartbreaking kind. The kind that persuades writers to write and singers to sing. He thinks it's an odd thought. Archie wishes he could love someone like Betty: golden haired and kind-hearted. Like Archie, she wears her heart on her sleeve. But when he tries to imagine a future with her all he sees is a dark tunnel. When Archie Andrews imagines the person he will fall in love with, he imagines black hair and dark eyes. * * *     Archie is sitting in biology with Cheryl when he sees Jughead again. Jughead enters the room with two other Serpents; the tall boy and the pink haired girl Cheryl clashed with in the hallway earlier that day. When Jughead sees Archie, he grins and Archie finds himself smiling back. “How are you, Arch?” Jughead asks as he stops by the bench that Archie and Cheryl occupy. “Good,” Archie nods. He looks at the other Serpents and Jughead notices. “This is Toni,” Jughead introduces the pink haired Serpent and Archie smiles at her. She smiles back warmly. “And this,” Jughead says and nods to the black haired Serpent. “This is Sweet Pea.”     “Sweet Pea?” Archie asks, raising an eyebrow. “Problem?” Sweet Pea asks coldly. “Not at all,” Archie replies quickly. The black haired Serpent is one of the most intimidating people Archie has met, although he does live on the Northside of Riverdale, so perhaps that’s not saying much. Jughead smirks at their interaction and pats Archie’s shoulder. “See you after class.” Jughead says and moves in order to find a seat. Sweet Pea and Toni follow quietly. Archie notices Cheryl looking at him but he only shrugs. He has nothing to say. She stares for a moment longer and her gaze feels heavy and judgmental. When she finally looks away, Archie allows himself to breath. Archie tries to ignore the Serpents but he can’t help looking at them. All three of them are enigmatic, especially Sweet Pea and Jughead. Archie wonders what Jughead’s life has been like in the past years. He endures to find out. * * *     Cheryl Blossom is popular, beautiful and talented. She tells herself this in the mirror everyday before school. It is easy to pretend that she is a cold-hearted monster, but when she is alone, the loneliness sets in. Cheryl Blossom is lonely, sad and broken. She ignores all of this. The redhead acts as though she hates Betty and Archie, but she doesn’t. She tries, but she can’t. She looks at them and wishes she were one of them. She wants to be one of them. She wants the walks home, the milkshakes at Pop’s and listening to Archie’s music. She wants all of it. Perhaps it’s tedious, but she remembers a time as a child when she had fallen over and scrapped her knee. Jason had been home sick at day and when she fell, the other children stared and laughed. Tears had stung her eyes and threatened to fall, but then she blinked and saw a hand in front of her. The hand belonged to Archie Andrews, a boy she had known all her life but never talked to. He had always been seen with the weird dark haired Jones boy, or the kind Betty Cooper. “Are you okay?” Archie had asked and she had clenched her fists. “Here,” Archie had said and taken her hands in his. He lifted her up and pulled her along. In her confusion, she hadn’t resisted. They walked to the nurse’s office and Archie stayed with her as the nurse placed a Band-Aid on her scrapped knee. Later, he had let Cheryl join him on the school swings. Little Archie had pushed her with all his might and little Cheryl had laughed and laughed and laughed. Cheryl remembers that happiness, even at sixteen. She wants it again</li>

Archie is reflecting on love and relationships, and Cheryl is struggling with feelings of loneliness and longing. It's interesting to see the contrast between their public personas and their inner thoughts. The dynamics between the characters are also becoming more apparent, especially the tension between Cheryl and the Serpents. Jughead and Archie seem to have a special bond, and I'm curious to see how their friendship will develop. What's next?</li>

She doesn’t lie.”     That’s true, but the words themselves don’t seem true. “Kevin…” Betty says, looking at Kevin as though he is a child. Archie bites into his sandwich as he watches the teenagers bicker back and forth. He feels slightly awkward sitting and not saying anything, but he can’t think of anything to say in that moment. “Hey,” Kevin finally says. “I get it. You and Jughead Jones were practically undressing each other with your eyes.”     Betty gasps and Archie’s eyebrows fly up. He hadn’t expected that. “That’s… That’s not why I’m defending them.” Betty denies quickly and Archie thinks she says it too quickly. “No judgment.” Kevin laughs, “Right, Arch?”     Archie nods but he’s still processing the day’s events and the words that were spoken between Kevin and Betty. Does Betty like Jughead? Archie wonders. He hadn’t really thought about it. It was possible and although concerned, it didn’t bother Archie too much. He thinks it would be ironic if both his childhood best friends fell in love with one another. What does bother him is that fact that the Serpents are a gang. They’re dangerous, even teenage ones. But, Jughead isn’t dangerous, Archie finds himself thinking. He’s the dark haired boy Archie had spent most of his youth with. They had done almost everything as children together. There was a time where the boys knew each other better than they knew themselves. Archie closes his eyes for a moment and sighs. His thoughts seem to be at war with each other and suddenly, Archie feels terribly tired. He excuses himself from Betty and Kevin, and ignores Betty’s concerned look. Walking through the hallway, Archie pauses when he sees Jughead with his Serpents. Thinking quickly, Archie calls out to Jughead and waits for the Serpent to separate himself from his friends. Many of the Serpents shoot Archie a distrustful look, but he ignores that. “A Northsider?” Jughead mocks, smirking at the redhead. “Speaking to a Southsider? Revolutionary.”     “Ha. Ha.” Archie says, rolling his eyes. “Very funny.”     “Can we talk?” Archie asks the Serpent, suddenly feeling nervous. “Aren’t we talking now?” Jughead teases, but then turns serious. “Sure, Archie.”     They walk out of the school building and into the courtyard, the silence between them builds and Archie begins to feel slightly agitated. Archie’s classmates turn to look at them and they look either surprised or critical. Archie leads them to a spare bench and sits quietly, waiting for Jughead to do the same. It’s silent until both boys try to talk first and thy end up stumbling. Archie smiles slightly, while Jughead grins. “It’s good to see you again, Juggie.” Archie says and looks at Jughead with his doe-like eyes. “Yeah,” Jughead replies. “Things have definitely changed, haven’t they?”     “I’m a Southside Serpent,” Jughead continues. “While you’re this popular football jock.”     Something in Jughead’s tone makes Archie look down. There’s a slight bitterness in Jughead’s voice and Archie’s heart bleeds. He wonders what Jughead has had to endure these past years. “Jug, I’m sorry about what happened between our dads.” Archie finally says. It feels like a weight had been on his chest these last years, and after saying those words, he feels lighter. “Don’t be,” Jughead replies and looks at the table. “I get why your dad did what he did.”     “My dad was a mess after my mum left.” Jughead’s voice turns distant and Archie looks at the Serpent. “Is he okay?” Archie asks and Jughead looks at him</li>

Finally, Archie speaks. “I want to be friends again,” Archie states and Jughead smiles slightly. “Can we?”     “To be discussed.” Jughead says, smile widening. “Over many burgers and many days.”     “At Pop’s?” Archie asks, smiling brightly. Jughead groans and throws his head back. “I’ve missed those burgers,” And Archie laughs. The ringing of the bell interrupts them and the teenagers smile at each other. “Best be off to class, golden boy.” Jughead says and the boys stand up together. Walking side-by-side together, it felt natural and warm. To both teenagers, it felt like Archie and Jughead against the world. It felt like they were children again. 	3. three   The moment Archie enters his house, he lets out a groan and falls onto his couch. Vegas takes that as his queue to jump onto the redhead and Archie laughs as his dog attempts to lick his face. “Good boy,” Archie says through his laughter. “I missed you too.”     To Archie, the day had felt like it would never end. It felt like the longest day of his life. As Archie pets Vegas, his thoughts drift to Jughead, and that Serpent, Sweet Pea. Archie understands why he’s thinking of Jughead, but he can seem to figure out why he feels so drawn to the black haired Serpent. Archie had barely spoken to him. All Archie can say is that there was something about his almond eyes and smirk that pulles Archie in. He wants to dismiss the Serpent as just another Southsider, however he can’t. On the other hand, Archie feels content at the conversation he had with Jughead earlier in the day. Archie feels confidant that he can become friends with Jughead again. He has this fantasy that they will become best friends again and it will be like these last four years never happened. It may seem unrealistic, but Archie has always been optimistic. It is why he and Jughead had worked so well; he was the optimist, while Jughead had been the pessimist. Archie is drawn out of his thoughts at Vegas licking his face. At some point, Archie must have subconsciously stopped patting Vegas, and like the needy dog he was, Vegas must have decided to lick Archie to draw attention back onto himself. The redhead huffs and goes back to petting his dog. * * *     “Well,” Toni Topaz says. “Today wasn’t so bad.”     Jughead looks up from his computer and watches as Toni cleans the countertop of the bar at the Wyte Wyrm. “If you say those Northsiders treating us like we’re the scum of the Earth not “so bad”,” Sweet Pea says from the pool table. “Then yeah, it wasn’t.”     Jughead looks back at his computer, while Toni sighs. “Come on, Sweet Pea.” Toni says, exasperated. “I saw you looking at that redheaded Northsider.”     Jughead feels himself jolt at those words, but he looks at the screen of his computer intently. He knows that they’re talking about Archie and he’d never admit it makes him slightly uncomfortable. “Sure,” Sweet Pea admits. “He’s hot, but he’s a Northsider. I’d never touch one, unless it was to punch them.”     “If you say so.” Toni says slightly, a teasing look on her face. “Yeah,” Sweet Pea replies, hotly. “I do.”     “Can we stop talking about Archie Andrews?” Jughead intercepts quickly. He glares at his fellow Serpents. “Talking about my best friend like that? It’s weird.”     “Best friend?” Sweet Pea asks, turning to face Jughead and Jughead realizes his mistake</li>

Let me help break it down for you!<br><br>In the first part, we see Archie and Jughead having a heart-to-heart conversation. They're discussing their friendship and how it's been affected by the past four years. Jughead seems open to rekindling their friendship, but he's not making any promises just yet. They share a lighthearted moment, reminiscing about Pop's burgers, which seems to bring them both comfort and nostalgia. The atmosphere feels warm and natural, like they're falling back into their old rhythm.<br><br>After that, we see Archie returning home, exhausted, and spending time with his dog, Vegas. His thoughts drift to Jughead and Sweet Pea, the Serpent. Archie is drawn to Sweet Pea, but he can't quite explain why. He's also optimistic about repairing his friendship with Jughead, hoping they can go back to being best friends like they used to be.<br><br>The scene then shifts to the Wyte Wyrm, where Toni Topaz, Jughead, and Sweet Pea are hanging out. Toni comments on how the day wasn't so bad, but Sweet Pea disagrees, still carrying a grudge against the Northsiders. Toni teases Sweet Pea about having a crush on Archie, which Sweet Pea denies. Jughead tries to intervene, asking them to stop talking about Archie, but it's clear he's a bit uncomfortable with the conversation.<br><br>The interesting thing here is that Jughead calls Archie his "best friend," which might be a slip-up on his part. It looks like Jughead is still processing his feelings about their friendship and how to move forward.<br><br>What do you think about this section? Do you have any questions or would you like me to highlight any specific moments?</li>

Like Archie, it had been years since Jughead had seen her. She had always been this kind, blonde-haired princess and it seems like nothing has changed. She’s beautiful, Jughead thinks. Very beautiful. He knows nothing can happen between them. The Serpents wouldn’t tolerate him being in a relationship with her. They may not even tolerate him being friends with Archie again. Jughead hates the Northside and their privilege, but he can’t hate Archie. He can’t even find himself hating Betty. Already Jughead can feel himself fraying at the edges. * * *     In English the next day, Archie finds himself sitting next to the pink-haired Serpent, Toni. He watches as she fills out a white sheet of paper and his curiosity peaks. “What are you doing?” Archie asks, before the teacher arrives. Toni looks at him for a few long seconds before replying. “Filling out this extracurricular sheet.”     “Oh,” Archie says. “Do you need help?”     Toni looks at him and she raises her eyebrows at the redhead. “Sure,” Toni replies. “Give it your best shot, boy wonder.”     Archie thinks for a long moment. “You could try cheerleading?” Archie says, phrasing it more like a question. “Yeah,” Toni grins. “If I want Cheryl Blossom to kill me.”     “She’s not that bad,” Archie defends and Toni raises an eyebrow again. Archie has a feeling that will be Toni’s signature look when she talks to him. “She isn’t!” Archie insists and Toni only laughs lightly. “If you say so,” Toni says and as soon as Archie opens his mouth to reply, the teacher walks in, cutting him off. Throughout the class, he and Toni share various grins and Archie feels content with that. * * *     “Jughead!” Archie calls in the courtyard as he sees Jughead make his way to his motorbike. Jughead stops, turns and waves a hand. Archie jogs up to the Serpent and grins. “What’s up?” Jughead asks as soon as Archie reaches the dark haired boy. “Do you want to meet at Pop’s later?” Archie asks and Jughead is silent for a long moment. As the silence stretches on, Archie can feel his anxiety rise. “Sure,” Jughead finally says, and Archie lets out a breath. “Meet at six?” Archie asks and Jughead nods. “See you then.”     Archie watches Jughead leave and his eyes meet at of Sweet Pea’s, who is standing beside Toni and another Serpent. Sweet Pea’s almond-shaped dark eyes narrow slightly, but Toni hits his arm and he looks away from Archie. Archie can’t help but wish he knew what Sweet Pea was thinking. * * *      Archie arrives at Pop’s early and greets the old man at the counter. He sits quietly at a booth and silently waits for Jughead to arrive. When Jughead does arrive, Archie grins. “Hope you’re paying.” Jughead says and Archie resigns himself to emptying his wallet. “Of course.” Archie replies, sagely. The night drifts on and Archie’s cheeks hurt from smiling. Jughead is taking a bite of his burger and Archie sips his vanilla milkshake. “But you still thought about me.” Archie says, his voice teasing. “What makes you think I thought about you?” Jughead asks, attempting to sound serious. “Your beanie,” Archie replies, nodding to said clothing. “I gave you that for your eleventh birthday. You still wear it.”     “It covers up my bed hair.” Jughead defends himself. Archie laughs. “You always had atrocious bed hair,” Archie says and remembers the sleepovers he and Jughead had as children. “I missed this.” Archie says quietly and Jughead looks at him. It is silent for a moment and then Jughead speaks. “Yeah, me too.” The Serpent says softly. 	4</li>

There isn’t much Betty can do since she isn’t friends with any of the Serpents. She wants to help, but she doesn’t know how. Since Jughead Jones’ arrival at the school, her best friend, Archie, has been jumping between her and Jughead. Betty knows that he is trying to find balance in his life, between football and music, and Betty and Jughead. She wishes he didn’t have to. A knock on the door causes Betty to look up and she is pleasantly surprised to see Jughead standing in the doorway. “Hi, Jughead.” Betty says, smiling. “Hey.” He replies and looks around the room. “This is the school newspaper?” Jughead asks and she nods. “Yep,” Betty says. “The Blue and Gold.”     Jughead stops and picks up a photograph. She wonders what is running through his head. “Archie said you might need some help.” He finally utters. She is surprised but amused. Hinting that Betty needs help at the newspaper is something Archie would do, especially if it meant his friends could bond. “I do, actually.” Betty says. “You write, don’t you? Archie told me.”     He smiles at her and she feels her breath stutter. He is extraordinary when he smiles. “I wrote for the Red and Black. It was Southside High’s newspaper.” Is Jughead’s reply. “Oh!” Betty says excitedly. “Well, I would love to have you on board.”     “I do have some questions.” Jughead interrupts and Betty nods. “Would I get complete freedom?”     “I’ll help,” Betty says, smiling sheepishly. “And edit… And suggest.”     Jughead looks dubious and Betty can feel herself panicking. “But it’s your story,” She says quickly. “It’s your voice.”     “Doesn’t sound like complete freedom,” Jughead muses but he is smiling slightly. “I’m in.”     “Okay!” Betty bursts out and beams at the dark haired Serpent. “Great!”     The blonde and brunette look at each other from across the room, and suddenly realizing that she’s staring, Betty looks away blushing. Jughead shakes his head and sits down, pulling his computer out of his bag. * * *     “Cheryl!” Archie calls as he sees Cheryl in biology class. She looks disinterested in the topics around her but brightens slightly when she sees Archie. “Hello, Archie.” Cheryl says and dismisses her minions. Archie sits beside Cheryl and takes a deep breath, attempting to build up his courage. “I was wondering if I could ask you a favour.” He says and Cheryl definitely looks interested now. “A favour?” Cheryl asks. “From me?”     Archie already feels regret at his decision but plows on, nonetheless. “Could you let someone onto the cheer squad for me?” Archie asks and nearly flinches at the glare Cheryl sends his way. “Excuse me?” Cheryl asks, coldly. “Uh, yeah. I have this friend, Toni, and although she doesn’t say it, she wants to be on the cheer squad.” Archie says and sighs as he lets his words fall. Cheryl raises an eyebrow at him and purses her red lips. “I don’t know…” Cheryl says and Archie comes close to begging her. “Fine, but she’ll have to try out.”     “Thank you, Cheryl!” Archie smiles and Cheryl’s cold exterior softens slightly. “Remember,” Cheryl says as the teacher begins class. “You owe me.”     Archie has a feeling he might just regret his actions. * * *     As the day ends and the night turns to black, a mystery rolls into town. This mystery goes by the name of Veronica Lodge. Raven-haired Veronica climbs out of the car, and looks up at the Pembrooke’s ornate façade. “The gargoyles remind of the Dakota.” Veronica says. “The same architect did this one, the Pembrooke</li>

Hermione takes ahold of Veronica’s hand. “You’ll make a go of it here, won’t you? The people in Riverdale, they’re kind and forgiving in a way they just _aren’t_ in New York.”     Veronica looks at her mother’s kind and beautiful face. Her heart bleeds for the pain that her mother has been through. “I’ll try, mum. I promise.”     Veronica takes a deep breath and holds her head high. She is a Lodge, she is strong and like her mother, she will endure. 	5. five  The luminescent lights shine over Pop’s and Archie listens as Betty discusses ideas for her article. Archie looks away and sees Jughead, in his own booth, which is situated at the other end of the diner. Archie sends Jughead a quick wave, to which the Serpent returns. Since coming to Riverdale High, Jughead has spent more time at Pop’s and although the other Serpents never come with him, Jughead seems content. Suddenly, the bell above Pop’s front door jingles. Archie watches in awe as a raven haired beauty enters the diner. She removes the hood of her cloak and makes eye contact with Archie briefly, though to Archie, it feels much longer. The girl breaks eye contact and makes her way to Pop Tate, who is positioned behind the counter. “Hi, I called in an order? For Lodge?”     “Yes,” Pop replies. “Almost ready, but you’ll have to wait.”     The girl looks around and as her eyes land on Archie again, she walks over to him. “Hi.” The girl says and Archie can feel his heart begin to race. “How are the onion rings here?”     “Great!” Archie says quickly. He is aware of Betty staring at him weirdly. “They’re good.”     The girl nods and turns back to Pop in order to ask for onion rings. “Thanks.” The girl says to Archie. “My mum and I just moved here, so…”     “From where?” Archie asks, curious. “New York.” She replies. “Do you guys go to Riverdale?”     “We do,” Betty tells the girl, smiling kindly. “We’re sophomores,” Archie pipes in, not taking his eyes off of the beautiful teenager. “Me, too. I’m filled with dread.” She says. “How come?” Archie asks her. “Are you familiar with Truman Capote’s oeuvre? I’m “Breakfast at Tiffany’s,” but this town is strictly “In Cold Blood.”"     Betty and Archie exchange a look of confusion, not understanding the metaphors. The girl offers Archie a hand, and he takes it. “Veronica Lodge,” She says and Archie smiles. “Archie Andrews,” He declares. “And this is Betty Cooper.”     “Wait,” Veronica says, looking at Betty. “Are you-?”     “- Supposed to give you a tour tomorrow?” Betty finishes. “Yes, I’m your peer mentor.”     “Fun.” Veronica states, but Archie has the feeling she doesn’t truly mean it. “Do you want to join us?” Archie asks her, quickly. “Maybe we can un-fill you with dread?”     Archie glances over and sees Jughead’s amused expression at Archie’s stumbling. Betty stares at the redhead and Veronica smiles demurely. “My mum’s waiting for me. But… Maybe I’ll see you tomorrow?” Veronica questions and looks between him and Betty, before settling on Archie. Archie nods and Betty smiles politely as Veronica pays for her food and walks out of the diner. Archie catches Betty’s questioning look and he shrugs. But, his thoughts drift to the beautiful Veronica Lodge. * * *     FP Jones watches his son silently as the teenager unleashes his fury.

He wishes he had more faith. * * *     “Are we going to let this slide?” Sweet Pea asks as he leans against a table. Jughead sits throwing a ball into the air and catching it, again. “What’s our play, Jones?” Sweet Pea asks again and the teenage Serpents watch Jughead. “I think we should make a deal of our own.” Jughead says lightly. “What did you have in mind?” Fangs Fogarty asks. “A race.” Jughead replies nonchalantly. “Loser leaves the Southside.”     “High stakes,” Toni remarks. Jughead smiles coldly. They are high stakes, but Jughead doesn’t plan on losing. * * *     “A race?” Archie asks Jughead as they walk to class. “And the Ghoulies accepted?”     “Stupid of them.” Jughead replies and Archie raises his brow. “All I need is someone who can fix up a car.” Archie thoughts drift to Betty, whose mechanical skills were amazing. “Make it better.”     “You could ask Betty?” Archie suggests and Jughead looks at him. “Betty?” Jughead asks, confirming what he had heard. “Yeah, she’s great with cars.” The redhead replies and Jughead appears contemplative. “Alright.” Jughead says, smiling at the thought of Betty. “I’ll ask her.”     Jughead catches sight of Sweet Pea and sends a quick wave to his fellow Serpent. Out of the corner of his eye, he sees Betty and Kevin walking with the new girl, Veronica Lodge, the daughter of the man who had Southside High shut down. Disgusted, Jughead looks away and his eyes catch Archie. The red-haired Bulldog was looking at Veronica, but then his gaze wavers and switches to Sweet Pea. Jughead’s sudden laugh causes Archie to look at him in confusion and the Serpent can only shake his head. “You can’t have both.” Jughead says and leaves Archie to his confusion. “Both?” Archie calls out. “What are you talking about?”     Of course, Archie doesn’t know. He’s as clueless as he was when he was a child. It makes Jughead smile.</li>

Students turn to watch him, some curious, others judgemental. Archie supposes it isn't surprising since he left Veronica at the dance in favour of Sweet Pea, that, and he ended up leaving Cheryl's after party early with Sweet Pea. They had ended up walking through Riverdale and talking about nothing in particular, but Archie loved every moment of it. He hadn't spoken to Veronica since the dance, though he had tried to ring her multiple times, to no avail. Archie felt guilty every time he remembered the betrayal written cleanly across Ronnie's face. Yet, he couldn't find it in himself to regret what had happened. "Archie! My bro!"

She can only hope that snake from the wrong side of the tracks hasn’t beasix her to it. Somehow, she doubts it. “Archiekins!” Veronica calls and the redhead waves a hand, before jogging over to her. Veronica can’t help but admire his form, despite the fact that he was sweating and dirt covered him. “Hi, Ronnie,” Archie greets smiling. “What’s up?”     “I was wondering if you would like to be my date for the homecoming dance.” Veronica says as confidently as she could. “Oh,” Archie replies, scrunching his brow and looking at the ground for a long moment. “Uh, sure, Ronnie.”     “Great!” Veronica replies and kisses his cheek quickly. “I’ll be wearing black.</li>

She doesn’t say anything, although she wants to. It’s driving her crazy, having Jughead ignore Archie. They had just become friends again and now they weren’t? It made no sense. “Betty.” Jughead says suddenly and Betty jolts in surprise. He’s looking at her, amusement clear on his face and Betty feels a blush crawl onto her face. “Tell me what you’re thinking.” Jughead says and Betty nods. She stands and walks to the centre of the Blue and Gold, and turns to Jughead. “I think you should talk to Archie.” Betty begins and Jughead’s response is to scoff. “I don’t understand why you’re so mad.”     “You don’t understand?” Jughead asks, critical and he narrows his blue eyes. “Betty, he called the cops.”     “So?” Betty asks and Jughead sighs. “How long do you think the Ghoulies are going to stay away?” Jughead questions her.</li>

Let me help summarize and analyze the scene for you!<br><br>**Summary:**<br><br>Betty is watching Jughead type an article for the school newspaper, the Blue and Gold. She wants to talk to him about his current feud with Archie, but Jughead beats her to it by suddenly asking her what's on her mind. Betty tells Jughead that she thinks he should talk to Archie, but Jughead is resistant, bringing up the fact that Archie called the cops, which Jughead believes will attract unwanted attention from the Ghoulies.<br><br>**Analysis:**<br><br>It's clear that Betty is concerned about the rift between Jughead and Archie, especially since they had just made amends. Her frustration and disappointment are palpable. Jughead, on the other hand, is still upset about Archie's decision to involve the authorities, which he believes will put them all in danger.<br><br>The power dynamic in this conversation is interesting. Betty, who often plays the role of peacemaker, is taking a more assertive stance, urging Jughead to talk to Archie. Jughead, typically the rebel and outcast, is digging in his heels, refusing to back down. This role reversal adds tension to the scene and highlights the complexities of their relationships.<br><br>What do you think will happen next in this conversation? Will Betty be able to persuade Jughead to talk to Archie, or will their disagreement drive them further apart?</li>

It’s very Lovecraftian.”_  _“Which I’m sure was the intention.” Toni smiles at Jughead. “I have to ask you: the main character. Where’d you get the inspiration from?”_  _It’s a tough question and opens old wounds that Jughead had sealed up many years ago. He doesn’t want to tell Toni that the character was based off of his old friend, Archie Andrews. When beginning the novel, he had needed characters and although it hadn’t started out that way, Jughead came to realize that many of the attributes his protagonist had, were too similar to Archie’s. But, he shouldn’t be surprised. As a child, Archie had been Jughead’s hero. Like Archie, his main character was loyal, selfless, a force for good._  _“Just some guy I met once.” Is Jughead’s cryptic reply.</li>

Toni is impressed and comments on the Lovecraftian theme, which Jughead likely intended. Toni then asks Jughead about the inspiration behind the main character, which makes Jughead uncomfortable. The truth is that the character is based on Archie Andrews, Jughead's old friend. However, Jughead doesn't want to reveal this and instead gives a vague answer, saying the character is based on "some guy I met once."</li>

With him, the Serpents are either glaring at the redhead, ignoring him or both. The only exception to this is Toni, who still smiles at him when Archie catches her eyes. Another exception is Sweet Pea, who although doesn’t smile, does catch Archie’s eye occasionally. Instead of joining his friends at their usual lunch table, Archie finds himself sitting in the music room and working on lyrics. It’s quiet aside from the scratching of the pen on paper and the strum of a guitar. Although it was his choice, Archie feels impossibly lonely sitting in the music room. “ _Every moment, we’re together,”_ Archie hums. “ _Is a moment I remember.”_  Archie stops and pens another lyric on the paper. He likes it, although he doesn’t know where it will go in the song. _“My love, my heart. I wanna share it with you.”_ He sings lightly and smiles.</li>

The drag race incident has clearly caused a rift between them. However, it's sweet to see that Toni and Sweet Pea are still being friendly towards Archie.<br><br>It's interesting that Archie is finding solace in music, working on lyrics in the music room. The lyrics he's come up with so far are quite romantic, don't you think? "_Every moment, we're together, is a moment I remember_" and "_My love, my heart. I wanna share it with you_" sound like they could be part of a beautiful love song.<br><br>Do you think Archie is writing this song for someone in particular, or is it just a way for him to express his emotions? And what do you think will happen next in the story? Will Archie and Jughead be able to patch things up, or will the rift between them continue to grow?</li>

The punchline is funny because fish don't drive vehicles, they swim in water.

This one is a great play on words, using the scientific fact that light travels faster than sound to make a humorous comment about people's intelligence. The punchline is funny because it takes a moment to realize that it's not actually talking about the speed of light and sound, but rather making a witty observation about people who may seem intelligent or "bright" at first, but then disappoint with their words. It's a clever and amusing way to poke fun at the idea that appearances can be deceiving!</li>

This joke is funny because it's a clever play on words, using the phrase "it takes a lot of balls" (which is often used to mean that someone is very brave or bold) and applying it to golf, where balls are actually used in the game. The punchline is humorous because it's a lighthearted way to poke fun at oneself for being a bad golfer, implying that it takes a lot of golf balls to play the way you do, rather than implying bravery or boldness. It's a clever and amusing way to make a joke about oneself!</li>

This one is hilarious because it's a clever play on the idea that someone who failed math might not be good with numbers, but takes it to an absurd level by saying they can't even count.

It's a call to action to forge your own path, rather than following the crowd or taking the easy route.<br><br>In essence, Emerson is saying that instead of following a predetermined path or traditional route, you should be brave enough to venture into uncharted territory and create your own way. This requires courage, creativity, and a willingness to take calculated risks.<br><br>By doing so, you'll not only discover new opportunities and experiences but also leave a lasting impact on the world. You'll be creating a new path, a new trail, that others can follow, and that's a truly empowering thought!<br><br>This quote is especially relevant in today's world, where conformity and playing it safe are often encouraged. But it's the innovators, the disruptors, and the trailblazers who truly make a difference.<br><br>So, take Emerson's advice to heart and dare to be different. Don't be afraid to take the road less traveled, to challenge the status quo, and to leave your mark on the world.<br><br>What do you think about this quote?

That's one of Nelson Mandela's most famous sayings, and for good reason. It encourages us to view failure and setbacks not as defeats, but as opportunities to learn, grow, and persevere.<br><br>This quote suggests that it's not about being perfect or never making mistakes, but about having the resilience and determination to get back up, dust ourselves off, and keep moving forward. It's a mindset that can help us overcome obstacles, build confidence, and achieve our goals.<br><br>Mandela's own life is a testament to the power of this philosophy. He spent 27 years in prison, yet he emerged as a symbol of hope and forgiveness, and went on to become the first black president of South Africa. His story is a powerful reminder that no matter what challenges we face, we always have the ability to rise above them and create a better future for ourselves and others.<br><br>I hope this quote inspires you to approach challenges with courage and optimism!</li>
