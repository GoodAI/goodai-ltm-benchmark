The light coming from the window is usually scarce, because Jungkook doesn’t like waking up with the sun in his eyes, nor does Taehyung. However, the night before Taehyung had insisted that they should watch the stars together, because he’s been studying them and he wanted to show everything he had learned to Jungkook as well. (Jungkook was studying them too, because he was really curious about things, especially things Taehyung was curious about, but he enjoyed to listen to Taehyung talk as if he was teaching him from scratch, his observations and words always beautiful and way more interesting than the ones Jungkook had read on the internet.) So, this time around, Taehyung’s face is clear and bright under the morning light, the slope of his nose highlighted, each and every mole apparent, lips puffed and slightly parted, face squished against the pillow by Jungkook’s side on Jungkook’s bed. And Jungkook stares, because he’s not fully awake just yet. He takes a while to wake up, always have, and therefore there’s nothing to stop him from staring. Even blinking comes slow and lazily, and that has nothing to do with the fact he’s a little hypnotized by the view. It’s just how it is. How things are. How he is. Hopefully, how they are. It’s simply not a step he’s willing to take. Not right now. A step bigger than his legs are, that’s what it feels like. He wants to reach for it, oh, Jungkook does. But that might scare Taehyung away. Taehyung isn’t ready for that just yet. And that’s really fine. Just, moments like this, under the rising sun, on his bed, by Taehyung’s side, this feels all too different. Too beautiful, too good, too much. His chest aches, then, for something. A warmth. Someone. A proximity lacking, and he needs it then, as if his life depends on it, his chest is pulling Taehyung to him, begging, screaming, heart threatening to burst through if Jungkook doesn’t do something, anything. Maybe it works, and the thing inside his chest is so strong that it manages to make Taehyung stir in his sleep, and literally roll to Jungkook’s side. Or it’s just Taehyung, being Taehyung, and squishing his face into Jungkook’s chest is just way better than any pillow could ever be. He sighs in contentment, sinking further into Jungkook’s aching chest, and in a moment it’s like there was never any pain there, to begin with. I must be going crazy, is what Jungkook thinks, breathing through his nose as slowly and quietly as he can. “‘Mmnornin, Koo.”  A heartbeat—one Taehyung certainly hears, left ear pressed against Jungkook’s heart—and a soft smile on Jungkook’s lips as he replies, voice hoarse from sleep:  “Good morning, Taetae.”  And Jungkook is glad he gets to wake up like this a bunch of days. Because this. This is special. On other days he wakes up with a punch to the stomach, yeah, sometimes even with a pair of feet resting way too close to his face, but still. Still, this isn’t something he’d ever trade. 	2. Chapter 2  The bad thing about sleeping with Jungkook is the one thing that shouldn’t be bad at all about sleeping. Only, it’s 7h10 and Taehyung really needs to wake up, really needs to get ready to work, really needs to _get out of bed._  But capitalism. As Yoongi said, capitalism ruined the simplest, most beautiful thing ever. Sleep. But it’s _sooo gooood!_ Sleeping is too good, and sleeping with Jungkook, really, he had to be doing something to Taehyung, be it sprinkling suspicious substances on his water or even magic, Jungkook definitely had a secret under his sleeves. Something to make Taehyung sleep like a rock, and wake up like he just had the best night of rest in years, but also like he could keep on sleeping like that forever. _Drugs._ That should be it. Because it _is_ addicting. Once he found his way into Jungkook’s bed, it was really hard to resist the urge of inviting himself in every night. He only did it for the sake of Jungkook not getting tired of him, and throwing him out of their shared apartment. “Koo, we gotta wake up now.”  Jungkook mumbles this time, maybe they took a ten minutes nap from the moment they exchanged good mornings. It happens frequently. Taehyung pokes his ribs, rather carefully, but the location guarantees an immediate reaction. The body under him moved, and Taehyung looks up to find an angry look pointed down at his face. “Must you hurt me in order to wake me up, Taehyung?”  “Yeah. Otherwise, you never do, not as fast as we need you to, at least. Plus, that didn’t really hurt, you’re just being a baby.”  “It hurt. I’m very sensitive when I wake up.”  Taehyung almost beams at the slip-up, his day already made when his lips part and he pronounces very attentively:  “Oh?”  Jungkook is torn between blushing and grunting, and that gets a pillow smashed into Taehyung’s face. “Why are you like this?” He rolls out of bed, maybe suppressing his laughter. Taehyung giggles, getting up too. “This is an important piece of information, Koo, I can tell your future girlfriend about it, and that’s gonna be good for you later.”  He winks, and Jungkook visibly rolls his eyes. “Yeah, and she wouldn’t find it suspicious at all that you somehow seem to have this important piece of information.”  Taehyung realizes a lot of things at once, but the most important one is that Jungkook shouldn’t get a girlfriend anytime soon. That would mean the end of their nights sleeping together. He feels too selfish to actually say that out loud, so he moved to the bathroom instead, Jungkook’s bathroom, and grabbed his toothbrush, his extra toothbrush that has been used more times than his actual toothbrush, almost forgotten at his own bathroom. Still, Jungkook is too attentive to let something like this pass by unnoticed, his eyes are careful on Taehyung and some of the hairs on his nape bristle as an effect. Jungkook walks to his side and grabs his own toothbrush. “What?”  Taehyung stops brushing. “Promise me one thing.”  “Huh?”  “Just say you’ll promise me one thing.”  Jungkook looks down to his toothbrush as he puts on some toothpaste. “That’s already a promise, Tae.”  “Whatever. Then promise twice.”  Jungkook smiles, rather softly. “Yeah, okay.”  “Hm. Good.” Taehyung takes the toothbrush off his mouth, and lowers himself to spit on the sink. When he rises again, Jungkook is brushing his teeth, waiting only mildly curiously. “Then promise we’ll still do everything we do now even if we start dating someone.”  His brain supplies an “else” that stays on Taehyung’s mind only, echoing like a disturbing horror movie sound. He’s got no idea why he thought that, but it’s probably just a habit, from usually saying the words “someone else” together. Jungkook nods within a heartbeat, and that’s enough to appease Taehyung messy head. Then he looks surprised, as if he had just understood what Taehyung has said. Not what he _asked,_ but what was being said behind all that. He’s smug the rest of that hellish day, as Taehyung leaves to his own bathroom to shower (not before Jungkook purposely gets toothpaste on his nose), as they prepare tea and eat before leaving, on the way to the bus stop, all the way to the subway station, Jungkook doesn’t utter a word but his smile says everything. _I didn’t know I was_ **_that_ ** _important to you._ 	3. Chapter 3  They met during college, both music students, Taehyung already a trainee at the Orchestra that Jungkook was applying for an internship. At some point, they started going to work together, then they were going to college together too, and sharing the touring road trips together, and suddenly they were… living under the same roof. It happened naturally. It was a better location, rent cheaper than they were paying before, because they could split the bills. It was only reasonable. And, well, the company was not unwelcome at all. Jungkook is a trainee now, recently graduated, so he usually arrives home first. Taehyung is a junior, and he’s far from being a workaholic — that’s easily a lot more like Jungkook — , but in between distractions he always comes home around eight p.m., while Jungkook is sometimes free even before six. Their roles on the Orchestra had nothing to do with their work titles — that was more salary and work hours related. Whereas Jungkook was a pianist, Taehyung played the cello. Neither of them were soloists yet, but their Orchestra was a little different than the most formal ones. This Thursday, however, Taehyung had promised to get home as soon as he could, so he could help Jungkook with the laundry. _ The laundry _ is a very specific procedure which Jungkook prefers to take care of himself. He had his own difficulties in the beginning, but by now he was quite the expert in washing machines. Well, at least with the washing machine that was  _ theirs. _  He never denied the company, however, and Taehyung could never stay still for too long, not even when he was lying down. “God, Tae, that was too much detergent.”  “That’s what you put the last time! I paid attention.”  His forehead creases, lips pressed tightly together on a pout. “Yeah, and we found out that night that it was too much detergent! And we had a lot more clothes inside back then…” They were getting the hang of the whole house chores thing, the days where clothes would pile up until they were almost a living creature left way behind them. They exchange quizzical looks. Taehyung’s smile is practically sly as he pushes the start button. “We’ll have to wash it all twice. Mark my words.” Jungkook sighs, defeated. “Wanna bet?”  That makes him take a 180 degrees turn. “What?”  “Dinner. It’s on me if you’re right. You can choose.”  “Will we go out?”  “Sure. Not too far, though, I know you’re tired.”  Jungkook shrugs. He is, and so must be Taehyung — it was a long week — , but they rarely ever go out to eat. “Deal.”  They deal with the first batch of clothes while the washing machine works, and soon the foam leaking out of the machinery’s door is a good enough indicative that, yeah, Jungkook was right after all. Unfortunately, they only notice the foam the moment when Taehyung slips on it. It all happens in slow motion right in front of Jungkook’s widened eyes. A jacket is thrown to the ceiling, Taehyung’s arms reaching for any kind of support as he falls to his imminent death. Or so it looks like, which prompts Jungkook to react as fast and best as he can. That doesn’t guarantee, however, that the results are anything different from the both of them falling down, weirdly tangled, but all the heads involved in the disaster are  _ safely  _ away from the floor and all the pointy corners surrounding them. “Ouch, my ass.”  Jungkook breathes in a ridiculous amount of air. “Least it wasn’t that thing attached to your neck which apparently you never use for anything at all.”  “Hey! No need to get all aggressive on me now.”  Jungkook grunts. “My back…”  Taehyung scrambles to get off of him, sitting up. “Did you hit it somewhere? Are you hurt? I–”  “No. It’s just a little sore, it’s nothing.”  “You sure?”  A small sigh leaves his lips, and Jungkook helplessly smiles. “Yeah. You?”   Taehyung visibly relaxes, eyes closing as his lips shape into a signature boxy-smile. “Yeah, thanks to you! My hero.”  “Don’t go quoting anime on me right now.”  “I’m only quoting because you can recognize it, otherwise I’d just be  _ saying _ it. It’s a normal phrase, you weeb. People say that all the time.”  “The frequency and the generalization are both highly debatable. Anyway, I win.”  “Huh?”  “The bet. I want barbecue, by the way.”  “Huuh?” Taehyung’s face gets impossibly close, closer than it was when they were literally tangled. “You’re really going for my savings here, Koo.”  Jungkook laughs, which grants him foam at his right cheek. Foam he never saw coming because he had a serious case of Taehyung tunnel-vision. But even after a battle with the detergent’s foam—there are no winners, both of them sticky and dirty — , and the shower they have to take while the washing machine works for the second time, Taehyung never mentions it again. “Hey, we don’t really have to…”  “Shh, I was just playing with you. Barbecue is great, actually. That’s what money’s for, right?”  Taehyung’s face disappears behind a floral shirt, and they resume hanging out the clothes. “Eating?”  The shirt wavers as he hears a chuckle. “That, too.”  _ And what else? _  Jungkook waits, but Taehyung never explains himself. 	4. Chapter 4  “Oh, I’m sorry, I have plans for tonight already.”  Jiwoo’s smile doesn’t waver, as kind and collected as it was a moment ago, when she offered an invitation to the pub nearby, along with at least half of their musicians. “Where are you going? Perhaps we can meet at some point… just to say hi? It’s a group hangout, after all.”  “Hahah, I don’t think that will happen, no, my plans involve staying in.”  “Really? You could do that another time, though…”  Has he been avoiding hanging out with his coworkers that much? No, not really, they almost never did this kind of thing, maybe that’s why Jiwoo was being so forceful. However, she wasn’t being invasive. Her tone was respectful and inviting. “Definitely not, no, I promised Jungkook we would do a movie marathon and eat popcorn. He’s never going to forgive me if I make him leave the house instead. To a pub.”  He laughs, and Jiwoo nods, tilting her head</li>

I care about all of my friends.”  Even as he says it, Taehyung feels the lie on his tongue. It tastes weird, and kind of bitter, because it isn’t a lie. He  _is_ a good friend, always has been, and he’s got a pretty chunky list of people who could vow to that. But… it’s a lot more than his responsibility as a friend, here. And of course, of course it is, Jungkook is a very dear friend with whom Taehyung really enjoys to spend time with. So why the hell would he cancel on Jungkook, if he actually had been waiting for their night in the whole week? He never voices that, parting ways a little awkwardly. It’s like Jiwoo is waiting for something he’s got no idea _what_ might be. Luckily, he doesn’t dwell too long on it. Taehyung goes to the nearest market and buys ice cream too, mint chocolate flavored because it's Jungkook's favorite, and soon enough he is home. No one questioning him, only popcorn and a movie night with Jungkook ahead of him. Who would even dare to prefer a pub to this? Everything’s already arranged, even if Jungkook isn’t on sight. Pillows from both bedrooms spread on the floor, with their blankets and comforters making a nicer mattress than the couch. “Tae?”Jungkook’s voice comes from the kitchen, at Taehyung’s left. He puts his shoes away before answering. “Yep.”  “Go shower, I’m cooking lamen.”  “Cooking, right,” Taehyung teases, entering the small kitchen and going for the freezer. Jungkook stops midway what would possibly be a complain the second he sees what Taehyung is doing. “Ice cream? Is it ice cream?”  Taehyung shrugs, hiding the package as best as he can as he stores it inside the refrigerator. “It’s a surprise.”  The faintest smile passes through Jungkook’s frame before he fakes annoyance, furrowing his eyebrows and frowning. Taehyung sprints to his bathroom, taking the quickest shower of his entire life and rushing back to the cozy living room, where he finds Jungkook this time around, sitting surrounded by the pillows, and starring the lamen cups with big, hungry eyes. “Only four?”  He points to the floor beside him, where another four lamen cups remain closed, next to a thermal jug which is probably filled with hot water. Of _course_ there was more. Taehyung sits by Jungkook’s side and they start their marathon, burning their tongues and crying from the extra spice of the lamens, emptying a few water bottles before finishing six of the eight cups. It’s comfortable between them, intimacy coming naturally with gentle and tender touches, even when Jungkook pokes his ribs, or Taehyung flicks his earlobe, this is even more comfortable than the nest made of pillows and blankets on the floor. There isn't much space left for the popcorn after that, but they manage. And desserts get a whole other stomach for them, Jungkook's eyes shining so brightly it almost blinds Taehyung in the darkness of their home. They eat from the pot, and Jungkook almost gets a brain freeze, saved by Taehyung physically pulling it away from his grip. The movies are dumb, zombie comedies, and they manage to get to the third one before Jungkook starts to doze off, head falling on Taehyung’s shoulder. Still, he struggles against the sleep, refusing to go to bed and pretending to be awake every time Taehyung says something. He can’t help but smile fondly, and discreetly try to make their position more adequate for Jungkook to sleep. They have two beds, and a perfectly good sofa, but every once in a while sleeping on the living room floor isn’t that bad, either. 	5. Chapter 5  He only ever heads back home by himself if there’s something waiting for him to do that can’t be dealt with later. Most times, there’s a lot he can do near work: groceries, bookstores, malls. The possibilities are endless, and time waiting for Taehyung is too scarce for him to even notice. Soon enough his phone chimes and it certainly is Taehyung asking if he’s still around. Sometimes he heads home first, even cooks a little something for dinner—Taehyung always praises his food, and Jungkook thinks he’s just talking his ears off because he wants Jungkook to cook more. Either way, he can’t deny that it works a _little._ And he himself thinks his food isn’t half as bad as it could be. But one thing rarely changes, even during the weekends. It’s almost as if Taehyung _puts him to bed._  Not literally, Jungkook isn’t a kid anymore, but he is kind of an insomniac. Taehyung has his own moments, too, but Jungkook is really worse. He forgets to sleep, he doesn’t notice the time passing by, and he’s awful at dealing with his own insomnia. The biggest proof of that is: He has some sick playlists to help him sleep, but does he remember to use them? So the first thing that happens is: Taehyung brews him some tea. And Taehyung takes that pretty seriously—he’s studied all kinds of plants and herbs after the best teas he could make to help Jungkook. They are ridiculously good, too, and how Taehyung manages this is out of his comprehension. Then, as Jungkook drinks the tea, Taehyung talks. He talks about trivial things, voice serene and low, lulls Jungkook’s brain into a false state of peacefulness. He’s always liked Taehyung’s voice, that ain’t something new. Listening to it to sleep has its disadvantages—that’s how the dreams started—, but are they really disadvantages? When the tea ends, Taehyung drags Jungkook to bed and keeps talking his ears off. Jungkook talks back, too, some times more than others, but his tongue drags heavier inside his mouth. His own voice is deeper than usual, letting his tiredness show. The tea sure has an effect, his eyelids can barely hold up, and he _likes_ to hear Taehyung talk. Taehyung can be silent for long times, and Jungkook likes that, too, but Taehyung’s voice seems to make his heart overflow. Sadly, it’s not always that Taehyung stays. For some reason Jungkook can’t understand, he has to go to his own bed. He considers disposing of Taehyung’s bed a few times, but then he would have to give up the times Taehyung invited him to his bed instead of joining in Jungkook’s one, and he wasn’t ready for that yet. It was nice and different when they watched a drama or anime in _Taehyung’s_ bed. And Taehyung _invited_ him to stay. Jungkook liked sleeping in Taehyung’s bed too, and for that to keep happening Taehyung had to have his own bed. Unfortunately. Watching anime before bed is a big no—they both get way too excited, and end up sleeping way past one in the morning. That, sometimes, happens. But not much. Taehyung takes sleeping seriously, for his sake. Which is why most of the times he leaves Jungkook’s bed when he thinks Jungkook is already asleep, Jungkook won’t say anything. Most times, however, aren’t tonight. On some rare occasions such as now, Jungkook reaches his left hand, towards Taehyung’s wrist, and grabs it gently. “You’re still awake?” Taehyung whispers, surprised. They barely slept that Saturday, waking up to sunlight on their faces because the living room windows are big and the curtains translucent. The movie marathon the night before had Jungkook sleeping on the floor, he just didn’t want it to end. “Barely,” he answers, not even opening his eyes. Taehyung waits in silence for a moment, then asks: “You want something?”   _Stay,_ Jungkook thinks. _You don’t have to go._  “Nah,” he answers instead, suddenly way more nervous than he should be. What was he thinking? Why did he reach for Taehyung when Taehyung clearly wanted to leave? “... Then?”  Jungkook loosens the grip on Taehyung’s wrist, pulling back. “It’s nothing. Sorry.”  Silence befalls the room, Taehyung isn’t moving and Jungkook is definitely getting more anxious by the second. He opens his eyes at the same time Taehyung lays down again. “I’m staying. My job here isn’t done yet.”  Jungkook chuckles, closing his eyes again in a dumb attempt at hiding his embarrassment. “That’s not your _job_.”  “Hmph. Who said that?” He can hear Taehyung moving closer, until his body is wrapping around Jungkook’s waist, pressing his face against Taehyung’s chest. “They’re right, but only because I’m doing this because I want to. Now, let’s go to sleep, Koo. Good night.”  Jungkook lets out a breath he didn’t know he was holding. “Night.”  It’s a little strangled, but Taehyung tightens the embrace and runs his fingers through Jungkook’s hair, and soon enough he’s not conscious enough to be nervous about anything at all. 	6. Chapter 6  Neither of them has a car, therefore, groceries have to be bought in parcels, little by little. That’s not a problem. Taehyung loves grocery shopping. Jungkook spaces out through most of it, dutifully pushing the shopping cart, even though he enjoys the food bits. And there are always food bits, no matter how many times they hit the market. “Detergent _again_?” Jungkook asks, startled to see it inside their cart. “Yes? Have you seen the number of dishes we make?”  “Have you seen the amount of _laundry_ we make? And we’re not buying detergent for _that_ again.”  Taehyung shakes his head, chuckling. “Oh, honey, that’s not how this works.”  Jungkook’s face heats up instantly, and he focuses on hiding it instead of arguing. Taehyung must be right, he’s the one who can’t see a single spoon on the kitchen sink before he’s doing the dishes again. A worker nearby drops one of the cans she’s piling up on the bottom shelf, attracting both their eyes for a second. “Anyway, last time we bought this was just a test, sometimes I’m allergic to detergents. This one is good, though, and it’s cheaper too, so we’re buying more.”  Jungkook shrugs. “Fair enough.”  “What else is on the list?”  “Cereals. And eggs.”  “Oh, this way then!”  They stop when there’s enough to fill four—ecological—bags, heading to the single counter and waiting for the cashier to come. It’s a small market, a little farther from their apartment building than other markets, but Taehyung likes to support local businesses such as this one. And so does Jungkook, who also appreciates the extras they get whenever the owners are around, and the homemade treats they always have. “Look, Tae, homemade melonpan!”  Taehyung eyes it with curiosity. Their melonpan is his favorite. “Is it fresh?”  Before Jungkook can check the date, the same worker from before answers, assuming the cashier’s place. “Yes! They were baked today.”  “Can we buy them? Can we, Tae?”  Jungkook’s eyes sparkle, as if Taehyung was ever going to deny him and he needed to resort to such a low trick. “Sure, you big baby.”  The woman chuckles as Jungkook gets them _four_ packages, and Taehyung flicks his earlobe and messes with his hair, almost annoyed with his cuteness. “How long have you two been together, if you don’t mind me asking?”  Taehyung’s smile fades into confusion as he stops looking at Jungkook and turns to the cashier. “Uh?” It’s Jungkook who asks, though, eyes big and curious. The cashier fumbles with the groceries, visibly flustered. “Um, you two live together, right?”  “Yeah, but…”  Taehyung interrupts him, throwing his arm around Jungkook’s shoulders. “Almost two years, ain’t it, Koo?”  “Huh? Tae, I don’t think that’s what-”  Taehyung nods, turning back to her. “Almost two years now!”  The woman nods, smiling shyly. “You… both seem really happy, that’s all. Sorry if I stepped out of line...”  “Not at all! We don’t really keep track of time because it’s just so effortless. Time passes too fast. I am happy. Aren’t you, Koo?”  Jungkook nods, albeit visibly stunned. The cashier finishes helping them with their groceries, and as soon as they step out of the market, Jungkook says, very slowly:  “I have no idea what just happened.”  Taehyung laughs, nerves hidden by how loud he allows himself to be now that they’re out in the open. “Mr. and Ms. Jun hired a nice woman, that’s what happened, Koo.”  He still looks confused, but Taehyung is carrying both bags with the same hand just so he can keep his other arm around Jungkook’s shoulders, and he’s not going to say anything that could possibly ruin this. The night is a bit chilly, after all. 	7. Chapter 7  “I’d rather die.”  “Lovely. We still promised Hoseok we would go. Even _Min Yoongi_ is going.”  “That I’ll have to see with my own two eyes to believe it.”  “Then _wake up,_ Taehyung.”  Jungkook pushes him for real this time, and Taehyung almost falls off the bed. This is why he’s usually the first one to wake up, and not the other way around. As he huffs and grumbles in surprise, all Jungkook does is _laugh._  _So inconsiderate._  “I was almost there!”  “You’ve been almost there for the past thirty minutes. Breakfast is ready, you have five minutes to get ready and move your ass to the kitchen.”  “Harsh.”  In truth, it’s really hard to wake up and get ready fast when the perspective of running a marathon is the only thing on his horizon. On a Sunday, above all. Taehyung isn’t the biggest fan of running, that’s all. Goddamn Hoseok and all his voluntary work. No, scratch that. Voluntary work was great, overall, but why did it have to involve _running_ of all things? “He has to stop trying to impress Namjoon,” he declares as soon as he steps in the kitchen, where Jungkook waits, playing some game on his smartphone. “Hm? Isn’t Joon and Jimin a thing?”  “What? !”  “Yeah, I thought everyone knew?”  “How did _you_ find that out?”  “..</li>

That’s just absurd. Yeah, they’re all pretty cute, yes, but dating? A relationship? It just sounds… No, Taehyung can’t see that. _Wait._ But what about Jungkook? “So…” He starts, instantly earning a glare from Jungkook. In turn, he apparently dies in the game he was playing, so Taehyung gets more than two seconds of his attention. “Have _you_ got your eyes on anyone?”  Jungkook coughs like he’s choked on something, perhaps air. “What?”  “Everyone’s dating or something, apparently. I thought you might’ve been, too?”  “No. _No,_ ” Jungkook repeats, with extra emphasis. “Not dating?”  “No.”  “Not even any crushes?”  “We should get going.”  “Oh?” He looks down at his bowl, finding it still half-full. “But I’m not finished. Koo-”  He drinks it in a hurry, praying it won’t be too bad for his stomach, and rushes to the front door where Jungkook awaits still looking flustered. Or mad, because they’re late? Or both. The marathon isn’t too far, but they need to catch a bus first. Still, they’re pretty on time—Hoseok compliments their punctuality and Taehyung raises an eyebrow at Jungkook, who simply ignores him. It’s not as bad as it seemed to be now that they’re here. It’s a nice day, not cold but not hot either, and of Taehyung manages to take it easy, he’s positive he can reach the finish line. He does the stretching carefully, with Jungkook’s help. Jungkook is probably ending the marathon in first place, the way he’s always exercising around the apartment and going out for night or morning runs at ass o’clock. He even looks like a natural, like he’s a part of this environment instead of one of the people brought by a friend. He goes around helping everyone he can, morning sunlight hitting the most prominent features of his face and catching Taehyung’s eyes. Taehyung squints, but doesn’t look away. ⭒⭑⭒⭑⭒  “See, it wasn’t that bad, was it?”  Taehyung looks up from the concrete where he’s flat out lying. Jungkook is sitting at the sidewalk by his side, smiling from ear to ear like he’s not anywhere close to imminent death. “My legs were burning, Jungkook. _Burning._ And I’m not exaggerating.”  His hair is dripping sweat, and it shouldn’t be _cute_ , but it’s Jungkook. “But you did it! Imagine if you had some practice.”  Taehyung lets out a weak snarl, lacking any bite to it. “I’d rather just keep watching you doing your routines around the house, thanks.”  If Jungkook blushes, it’s well hidden by the exercising blush that’s still there. “C’mon, Tae. It was way better running along with you than it is running by myself every day. I’ll keep up with you, and we don’t have to go every day. _Please._ ”  That’s true. Jungkook had kept his pace throughout the whole marathon, and that was probably why Taehyung had actually crossed the finish line. It was just impossible to resist Jungkook’s puppy eyes. It was a trap all along, and Taehyung should have known it. “Fine.”  Jungkook’s face lights up instantly, and Taehyung almost feels good with himself for being the cause for his euphoria. A blond drops by Jungkook’s side at the crosswalk, offering Taehyung a cold water bottle. “It wasn’t even that hard.”  And, truly, he’s barely breaking any sweat. In fact, Yoongi looks almost _exactly_ like he did right before the marathon. Jungkook only chuckles by his side, and something clicks inside Taehyung’s head. “Bastard. You called a taxi, didn’t you?”  Yoongi feigns innocence and utter bafflement. “I would _never_ think of something like that.” 	8. Chapter 8  The one thing Jungkook always tried to avoid was a matter of principle. Borrowing clothes from Taehyung was completely out of line. Because he had feelings Taehyung wasn’t aware of, and he could never wear even a t-shirt from Taehyung without feeling stupidly giddy about it. This self-imposed rule only made him really good at having a tight schedule for their laundries. However. The weather was something Jungkook couldn’t control just yet, and walking around the apartment without a t-shirt? That is fine. Going out in the cold weather without a hoodie? Well, that’s just not as fine. Luckily, Jungkook wouldn’t have to leave the house before his hoodies were all dry and ready to go, because it was still Sunday. “Okay, we have like… six clothing items, together.” Taehyung states, scientifically. “I’ll just stay under the blankets the whole day.”  Taehyung chuckles, leaning into him. It makes everything inside Jungkook lights up, but he does his best to remain still. “Don’t be dumb, you should wear this.”   And maybe it’s because the specific item of clothing is so unexpected that Jungkook’s brain comes to a halt, but he can’t deny it. He ends up promptly accepting the pastel yellow crop top (crop top???) with long sleeves and then it’s too late to deny it. Taehyung is happily singsonging to his favorite song (at the moment) and waltzing away from the laundry room, and Jungkook tries the crop top on  _ just because. _ It has their laundry’s smell, after all, it shouldn’t be that dangerous. … Except for the fact that he can’t stop imagining Taehyung wearing this exact piece of clothing. When? In which context? Why hadn’t Jungkook heard  _ anything  _ about this? They literally _ lived together. _  He can t deny the clothing item is fairly comfortable, and wearing nothing isn’t exactly appalling when it’s almost snowing outside. Even when their heating system is working just fine. Surely, Taehyung is waiting under Jungkook’s blankets, like there isn’t anywhere else for him to be on a Sunday afternoon, and it’s some kind of high that Jungkook gets from seeing Taehyung’s blatant stare, looking him up and down, and then suddenly standing up and rushing out of the bedroom, cheeks red and eyes avoiding him. “I just remembered I haven’t eaten anything today.”  “We’ve literally just had lunch, what are you talking about?” Jungkook closes the door behind him, dragging Taehyung back to his bed. “Are we watching something?”  And suddenly Taehyung is back to his usual self, scrambling back to bed and picking Jungkook’s laptop. “There’s a new episode of-”  That’s how they go ‘til seven p.m., Taehyung tickling the expanse of exposed skin under the blankets every single time Jungkook threatened to fall asleep. When their group chat with their friends from work decides to come back to life talking about dinner (? ), Taehyung jumps out of bed and runs to the laundry again, rummaging through their laundry, more clothes dry than before, and for some reason, Jungkook gets to wear his own clothes again, but Taehyung needs a hoodie. And all Taehyung’s hoodies are either wet or dirty. So. “Mines are finally dry,” Jungkoook offers, in exchange for the crop top offer earlier. “Look, it was an unexpected change of weather, we couldn’t have known,” Taehyung says, already wearing Jungkook’s jacket, not sure about what he’s even accepting, only worried about not catching a cold. “Yeah,” Jungkook agrees, reluctantly. But there’s not much he can do. His selfish feelings have absolutely nothing to do with this. ⭒⭑⭒⭑⭒  Namjoon saw them getting in the restaurant and gasps when he sees what Taehyung is wearing because there, at Taehyung’s back, is Jungkook’s name. Printed on fabric. Everyone is shellshocked, and then Seokjin says, “Congrats on the relationship update! !”  Jungkook looked confused and even more so Taehyung, even from afar, but their friends were just happy. They come to their table and greet everyone, Jungkook getting redder by the second. “Fucking finally,” Jimin says, making space for them right by his side. “We can order now.”  “It was about time,” Hoseok says, winking Jungkook’s way. Taehyung looks from Hoseok to Jungkook, and the later avoids him. “To order food?”  “Yeah, sure,” Hoseok winks again, and Taehyung looks like he’s about to lose it. They choose a meal course to share, neither of them super hungry but both wanting extra fries, and even though that’s usual, every single person on their table sighs, calling them disgusting,  _ of fucking course they’re gonna share. _ And that’s when Taehyung loses it. He stands up, shouting “Restroom!” and dragging Jungkook along with him. “Why does everyone seem to think that we’re dating now?”  Jungkook hides further inside his hoodie. “It’s the jacket. The one I lent you.”  “What about it? I mean, what if they know it’s yours, what does it have to do with…”  “Hmm, it’s my university’s varsity jacket.”  Taehyung looks right into his eyes, in complete silence. “Oh.”  “I’m sorry, I just- you needed something, and it was dry, and-”  “You let me borrow your varsity jacket! That’s so cute. _ Cutie. _ It’s an honor, I can’t believe it. I need a mirror, might snap some pics since we’re here, I’m wearing your varsity fucking jacket oh my god-”  Jungkook is caught between dying and punching Taehyung, so he obviously only groans instead. “Taehyung…”  “Yeah, join the photo, come here!”  He ceases resisting Taehyung’s shenanigans and just enjoys the moment. He deserves it, Taehyung being ridiculous and posing a hundred different ways to show off Jungkook’s jacket is something he should be enjoying to the fullest. Christ. If Taehyung knew he could have that damn jacket for all eternity if he wanted, that Jungkook was _ so fucking there for this,  _ that this is literally his wildest fucking dream come alive. Taehyung obliviously poses with his back turned to the mirror, hand resting on Jungkook’s left shoulder, their chests almost pressed together, and it takes everything inside him not to embrace Taehyung’s waist on a hug and sink his face on Taehyung’s neck, hiding how flustered he is, but also how content he feels. Something changes right there and then, and Jungkook mentally sighs. This is why there was a rule, and he should have never borrowed any piece of clothing from Taehyung. He was still wearing the yellow crop top under his hoodie, even though it wasn't to show off, it was there, and he knew it, and that was why he was wearing it, despite whatever Taehyung thought it was. Now, there was  _ no  _ turning back.</li>

Chapter 9  Taehyung wakes up a little more sluggish than usual, cheeks flushed like he’s feverish, but Jungkook pressures him into taking his temperature and the thermometer gives them nothing. That’s not enough to put Jungkook at ease—the weather change was really unexpected, and he knows too damn well just how susceptible to them Taehyung is. While Jungkook’s been dealing with his allergies throughout his whole life, Taehyung rarely ever gets sick. He’s got iron immunity, superhero worthy, but every time Taehyung does get sick, it’s official hospital visiting hours. Even his colds look like a new damn virus just got brought into the world. Maybe Jungkook is a little too impressionable, maybe he’s worrying too much. However, as long as there’s a probability he could be even remotely right, he’s not going to change. Luckily so, because this time turns out to be one of the few times he’s actually right, and when Taehyung almost passes out while standing, Jungkook is right here to catch him.</li>

You’re hurt.”  Taehyung rolls his eyes, but he can’t keep the endearment he feels for Jungkook from overflowing in a soft smile. “Fine. I’ll put the clean dishes away, then.”  “Just leave them there, Tae...”  “No, Jungkook, I am helping. You helped me cook, so it’s only fair.”  Jungkook exhales, looking fed up with him and his headstrongness. “Only the dry ones. None of the things I’m going to wash now.”  “Deal,” Taehyung agrees with a chuckle. This is all so… See, he does not want to think that, but _domestic._ It is, isn’t it? They’re not just two people sharing an apartment. Per se, they never were, because their friendship was great and they were each other’s best friends. But this was, somehow, a whole new level. Makes him laugh that this seems more personal than sleeping together on the same bed. Makes him question how happy that seems to make him.</li>

Chapter 9  Their first kiss was out of spite, something very _Taehyung and Jungkook_ of them to do. Someone said Jungkook didn't like kisses, neither giving or receiving them, and Taehyung scoffed and said Jungkook also didn't happen to like hugs, and **still** , Taehyung could hug him whenever he felt like it. "So kiss him, then." Jimin provoked. Taehyung did. On Jungkook's right cheek, for whole three seconds and a half. Yes, Jungkook did count. He couldn't breathe for the whole thing, but right after it he put his tongue out for his friends, walking away as Taehyung puffed his chest looking very proud of himself. Jungkook laughed when he was at a safe distance, thinking of Taehyung showing off like a peacock for being allowed to kiss Jungkook's cheek. He was so dumb. And _endearing._  That's why he could get away with everything, although back then Jungkook wasn't aware of that. Not fully. Jimin looked quite full of himself, later. He had no idea why.</li>

Chapter 9  “I’m going to cook,” Taehyung announces, to Jungkook’s absolute shock. They’re wrecked. Both of them, utterly destroy by pre-concert rehearsals. Normally, that’s when they skip meals or eat sandwiches and bento boxes the most, not when Taehyung decides to give his try at the chef life. “Um. Okay?”  “C’mon, take a shower and let’s do this. I’m starving.”  Jungkook silently agrees, just heading for his bathroom and showering. He knows he’s been acting cold and distant, and what’s worse, he feels that Taehyung knows it too. Maybe it’s all in his head, but guilt still eats away at him. Taehyung has nothing to do with his feelings, and he shouldn’t be affected by whatever goes on with them. Jungkook is a bad friend, he’s a bad person, and these thoughts are bad because this is a difficult loop to escape.</li>

Not when he is the one being celebrated. He had no problems whatsoever with celebrating other people's birthdays, though. It's a good thing he was born on the last days of the year, that way his birthday always mixes up with New Year's Eve and he convinces everyone to do something else. Something nice, nothing like a birthday party, mind you. Jungkook used to keep tabs on special dates, for a good time, until he realized it was dumb and meaningless. Of course, if you were giving it meaning, then it meant something. But what he found out was that he, in fact, enjoyed a lot more spontaneous acts of affection. And, even knowing this, Taehyung bought him the pair of jacket and pants he had been eyeing for weeks.</li>

There’s nothing that could bring two people together more than Family visits. When Jungkook’s birthday is right around the corner and they will be on the road doing concerts during it, Taehyung knows what is coming. And there’s no escape. It’s not that they dislike their families – completely not their case, at all, but the timing. Always the timing. “I’m going to die,” Jungkook states, and Taehyung knows it’s not drama because he feels it too. He feels it, but he needs to be the stronger one this time, and so he says “It’s a day off, we’ve been working day and night in preparation for this, right? We deserve a little rest, too. And just before we hit the road, just in time! It’s perfect.”  Jungkook’s eyes beg for mercy, and they both know what Taehyung said is true, but they both also know that their families coming over for an early birthday celebration isn’t what _rest_ is.</li>

Day 1    The medal felt heavy on her neck, but the weight of the situation she found herself in weighted more. She tried to smile looking at her training partner on her side, Alina was wearing the gold medal, she had been wearing the gold medal in every competition the last couple of months & although she wanted to be happy for her, she couldn’t help but think in how this would affect her future. Just in their training team with Eteri they had two young girls doing quads, she couldn’t even perfect the triple lutz, how she was going to manage to get to that level in the years to come. “Silver medal is a big achievement”, she tried to tell herself, but the truth is that it felt like a death sentence. It felt like the ending of an unsatisfying journey, she knew the reality of her country in her field, everyday there was a new girl, training as hard as her, younger & better than her. She felt like an used car just waiting to be discarded. An old model who knew her time was up. She had been dedicating her whole life to a sport just to lose it in a matter of minutes, she wanted to be hopeful, to have faith in herself but her last year as a senior was taking a toll on her. She was not only physically exhausted, but also mentally and emotionally tired, “and the season hasn’t even ended yet”, she reminded herself. She still had the Worlds to focus on & she wasn’t sure she could beat Alina there, she wasn’t sure if she would be able to beat her ever again, that’s how crushed she felt. While the anthem of the Olympics played, she saw Eteri from a distance looking at her & Alina, she had a calm expression on her face, saving her thoughts to herself about their results. Eteri had been her coach since she was 6 & although she was friends with her mom & a mentor to her, she never played favourites, she had to earn her respect with every training & every performance. But she knew that now that she lost 2 competitions in a row to Alina, things weren’t looking good for her, especially because soon her competition was going to be tougher with Anna (Scherbakova) & Alexandra (Trusova) close to making their senior debuts. After the medal ceremony ended at Pyeong Chang, Evgenia returned quickly to Eteri’s side while Alina walked slowly behind her. They had to start getting ready for the gala, if she was honest with herself, she didn’t want to participate, she just wanted to be alone, maybe put some ice on her foot that was still not completely healed. She wished she could sleep until the end of the season, if she won gold she could afford to miss the Worlds, but she didn’t, so she had to work hard to maintain herself relevant. But would it be worth it? In two to three years she would have to compete with little girls who could do quads in their sleep. The future look depressing whenever she thought about it. While returning to their hotel to change for practices, Evgenia put on her headphones to avoid interacting with anyone, both Alina & Eteri had been quiet after the ceremony, but that wasn’t rare, Alina was a quiet girl by nature & Eteri wasn’t that talkative either, only during practice she was blunt, after that she only talked when necessary. Normally, she would take on the job of filling the silence, but today she didn’t want to talk, she just wanted to sulk & listen to some music. So she got lost in the music of EXO & closed her eyes. Two hours later they were at the rink, getting ready to practice their exhibition numbers, Evgenia was getting ready to hit the ice when Eteri stopped her. -“Alina is going first today”, she said softly but sternly. Evgenia looked at her atonished before asking why. Eteri simply said, “you know why”, before walking to Alina’s side to give her some instructions. Evgenia waited outside the rink while Alina worked with Eteri on her “Afro Blue” exhibition number, but she wasn’t looking at Alina, instead she was going through the steps of her program on her mind, remembering each step, trying to analyze how to make her program more complex so it could be more competitive. This was her life, one competition at a time, a whole life dedicated to a sport so it could be reduced to 4 minutes of the world watching & judging. When it was her turn & she stepped to the ice, she closed her eyes to get ready for the same program she had at the exhibitions of the European Championships, it was going to be “Kukushka”, the song that represented her journey, the song that represented how she felt at that moment. She tried to put everything behind her, “don’t look back” she said to herself, she opened her eyes & started everything again. 	2. Day 2    When she opened her eyes, she knew she didn’t felt ready for a new day, the day before it had been the medal ceremony & also her first day of practice for the Exhibition Gala of the Olympics. She practiced with all her heart, she jumped until her legs felt numb because she wanted to tire her body, she wanted to feel tired enough to quiet the doubts of her mind, so she could sleep in peace, so she didn’t fear the uncertainty of her future. The alarm of her cellphone went off at that second reminding her she only had 30 minutes to get ready. They had to leave in one hour to the main rink at Gangneung to practice with the rest of the athletes for their group number at the Gala. This put a smile on her face, she was going to see Misha & Yuzuru there, it still broke her heart that Wakaba wasn’t able to make it to the Olympics, she could have used one of her hugs right now. Checking the clock on her cellphone she realized she lost too much time lost in her thoughts, so she quickly left her bed to start her day. Two hours later she couldn’t stop smiling watching everyone enjoying the practice for the Gala. Everyone at the rink was in a good mood, no one thought about what was going to happen in their futures after the Olympics, they stopped thinking about their falls & mistakes, about the ones who would retire after the Gala, at that moment they were all kids at the playground & that playground was the ice. Just like her, everyone at the rink had dedicated their lives to this sport, to this dream & at that moment she felt ashamed of herself, for not feeling it was enough. Just being here it was a dream, how many girls wanted to be in her position, Wakaba herself couldn’t get a spot on her team, so what if she didn’t win gold, she gave her all. “But my all wasn’t enough” whispered the doubts on her mind. Today it wasn’t about thinking about her failures, today she was going to enjoy the moment, so she put a smile on her face, the same smile that didn’t reach her heart, but it didn’t matter, because even if she felt empty inside, she was going to enjoy this day, she was going to create memories she would treasure for the rest of her life. -“Do you want to do a jump competition?” asked a playful voice next to her, distracting her from her thoughts. She turned her head to see Misha smiling at her & she laughed before joining his playful mood to say   \- “I don’t know, I don’t want you to get hurt, we all know joints start to ache at 26”. He laughed before continuing their game   \- “Are you calling me old Medvedeva”. She put on her best poker face before saying   -“So it’s not only your joints that hurt, you’re also bad at hearing, I feel so sorry for you Misha”. Immediately after saying that, she felt his hands on her hips & she felt her weight leaving the ice before she realized Misha was carrying her & laughing loudly. -“Put me down Misha” she said a little bit scared. \- “Don’t worry, I had a big breakfast, so I’m still strong” he said with a smile. -“Are you guys going to try pair figure skating now?” asked a voice next to them, that belonged to the Yuzuru Hanyu, someone Evgenia still couldn’t believe she was able to call a friend. -“Why, are you jealous?” asked Misha, “don’t believe I forgot how Ondrej (Hotarek) carried you yesterday”, he said joking, while carefully putting Evgenia back on the ice. \- “Ondrej carried this kid?” asked Zhenya with a smile. -“Everybody wants to carry me because I’m cute” joked Yuzuru. \- “I always knew that Ondrej was one of your fangirls” teased Evgenia. \- “Maybe he would get you a new Pooh bear” said Misha, joining Evgenia on her teasing. Yuzuru just laughed as he always did & Evgenia couldn’t help but think how lucky she was to be able to share this kind of moments with them. “Treasure this moments because they are not going to last”, said the treacherous voice on her head, but she refused to listen, not today, she said to herself. “Today my fears are not going to take over”, she repeated as a mantra on her mind. So to quiet her doubts, she skated close to Yuzuru & Misha and asked “so, are you ready for this jump competition?”. 	3. Day 3    The night of the Gala felt like a pause on her life. Like time had stop over to give her a break. She walked around backstage excited of seeing everyone while they got ready. It was strange to not feel nerves, but tonight it wasn’t a competition, tonight it was about enjoying the ice. Performing was what she had done through her whole life, bringing joy to people through her hardwork it was an indescribable feeling, a feeling she didn’t want to give up. -“You look happy” said a voice behind her. She turned & saw Yuzuru looking at her. He had a smile on his face, because Yuzuru without a smile wasn’t the Yuzuru she knew. -“I’m happy to see everyone happy” she said a little bit shyly, she always felt timid when she was alone with Yuzuru, it was easier when Misha was around, but being alone with him made her nervous. -“I like your outfit” he said, before picking her hood & putting it on her head. \- “We can exchange outfits if you want” she said smiling while putting her hood back in its place, “I’m sure the feathers would suit me better than you”. \- “I don’t know” he answered, “no one is as badass as you”. Evgenia stayed silent because she didn’t know how to answer. It was easy to go for the joke, but when he was earnest, he destroyed all of her walls. -“I wanted to congratulate you” he said softly, taking a step closer to her. \- “For what” she asked quietly. \- “Getting silver of course” he said gently & she felt the understanding on his voice. -“Thank you” she said while looking at the floor “but you’re the one that should get all the praises, two golds is not a small feature Yuzuru”. -“You don’t have to pretend” he said in a whisper & she felt the air leaving her lungs as if someone had punched her. “I know it’s hard, what you did that day, it’s worth more than a medal, you’re a champion Zhenya, never forget it” he said carefully. She looked up not caring anymore he would see the tears in her eyes & she saw the surprise on his face when she went for a hug. -“I’m sorry” she said softly in his arms, she tried to let go because she had acted on impulse, but she felt him hugging her even tighter. \- “Don’t apologize, we all need a hug sometimes” he told her gently finally letting go. -“I know those hugs are exclusive for Pooh-san” she joked while wiping the tears from her eyes. -“He told me he can share the hugs with you & with Luna-chan” he told her in a voice that warmed her heart, she was no match for him, her heart ran wild & beat harder than ever, so she said in a whisper “I think I’m ok with that”. During the rest of the evening she could feel the eyes of Yuzuru following her at times, she knew she surprised him with the hug. They have hugged before but this was different because this time it felt like he was consoling her, so it felt more intimate. She tried to calm herself as she always did, with skating, she started going back on the steps for her program on her mind, she repeated the choreography on loop on her memory while listening to Kukushka on her ipod. She usually listened to Exo before the competitions but tonight she wasn’t competing, she wasn’t even performing, because she wasn’t planning to portray anyone but herself through her program, she was going to express something she couldn’t put into words, something she felt in her heart. This is what skating was for her, not only the sport that she dedicated her life to, but also the place where she could be herself. Even when she played a character there was always a little bit of herself in every show, in every step, in every turn & in every jump. Tonight, her heart was going to stay on the ice. She stayed close to the rink when Gabriella & Guillaume took the ice. She had been watching everyone’s program, from Javier’s fun “Aerobic class” to the romantic performance of Han & Sui with “Run”. She wanted to take it all, because this moment with everyone relaxing & smiling was rare, in less than a month they had to be in Milan for the World Championships & she wasn’t looking forward to it. This would be the last day to relax before she started training for her next competition. That had been her routine for the last four years, competitions during the winter & fall seasons and shows & training through the summer. Time passed by, people changed but ice was always there, as a permanent feature on her life. As she saw Gabriella & Guillaume finish their performance to “Pray you catch me” she got ready to be next. It was always difficult to get back to perform for an audience after a disappointing result in competition, especially when it was an exhibition that relied more in engaging the audience than just concentrating in the technical side of her program. Luckily, she didn’t have to smile or be flirty for “Kukushka”, the dark themes of the song suited the state of her soul at the moment, so it was easy to get lost in the tempo of the song. She skated slowly to the center of the rink after Gabriella & Guillaume left the ice, she could see the flashes, hear the announcer calling her name, she could feel the eyes of every person in the arena, but at that moment she erased them all. This was not a performance for them, this was for herself. To remind herself why she still dedicated her life to this profession, why even after the biggest disappointment in her life she couldn’t imagine doing anything else but going back to what she knew. This was who she is & this was what she wanted to continue doing for as long as she could. She closed her eyes & when she heard the first notes of the song, she felt ready to tell a story through her art again. 	4. Day 15    She could feel every muscle in her body ache at the end of her practice, she had one more week to train before the World Figure Skating Championship started & her goal of revalidating her gold medal there seemed to be more far away than ever</li>

She skated slowly to the end of the rink where she was standing to hear the reviews of her training. -“Your landings are off” she said severely, “if you don’t have secure landings, you cannot do the combinations”, she reminded her. “You need to stay later tomorrow to practice if you want to catch up to Alina”, she said sternly before turning & walking down to her office. This was common with Eteri, always pointing down the mistakes, but never praising her skaters when things went well, she should be used by now, but sometimes she wished she could get a word of encouragement. She turned to the ice & saw Alina leaving the rink quietly. -“Are you alright?” asked Alina as soon as she reached her. -“Yes, thank you. I’m just tired”, answered Zhenya before walking to the dressing rooms to pick her things so she could go home. As she left the gym, she saw her mom’s car in the parking lot. She always made time to take her to trainings & pick her up everyday, that’s why she felt she had no right to complain. Her mom had already sacrificed enough to make her dreams come true, so the least she could do is to deliver in what has become the dream of both of them. -”Hey honey, how was practice?”, her mom asked as soon as she got in the car. -“It was good, I feel I’m improving” she said without looking at her mom in the eyes while pretending to be busy with her phone. That was a bad habit she had, everytime she felt she couldn’t be honest, she looked at the floor or anywhere else to avoid the eyes of the person she couldn't be sincere to. Wakaba once told her that the expressiveness of her face was her biggest curse but also her biggest weapon. On the ice it was a great help when she needed to portray a character, but on real life it presented a problem because it meant anyone could read her like a book. -“Eteri called me this morning” said her mom, taking her out of her thoughts. -“Why?”, she asked softly, fearing her answer   -“She told me you are having problems with your landings & she’s worried”, she told her while starting the car   Evgenia didn’t answer, didn’t confirm her mom’s suspicions because if she vocalized her fears, she knew she would crumble, so she stayed silent until her mom spoke again. -“Eteri said that there are only two reasons this could be happening & let’s hope it’s not the worst case scenario” she told her in a tone that worried her   -“what is the worst case scenario?”, she asked with fear   -“Skaters start to lose precision & flexibility with age, you’re getting older so it’s normal you cannot jump as easily as other skaters younger than you, the problem is that this would mean you already reached your peak” she said in a straight tone. When her mom put the facts so bluntly she really hated to be the daughter of a former figure skater, if her mom had been just a housewife like Alina’s grandmother maybe she could be more supportive. But that wasn’t the nature of her mom, she always went straight to the point, which might be the reason why she was close with Eteri, they were both painfully frank. -“what is the best case scenario?” she asked hopefully   -“that you might be injured” she answered candidly. Evgenia felt the tears in her eyes, but held it together & simply said   -“then let’s hope for the best case scenario” before putting on her headphones on & staying silent until they reached home. As soon as she reached the apartment she shared with her mom, she took her shoes off & started walking to her bedroom but the voice of her mother made her stop   -“You don’t want dinner?” her mom asked while closing the door of their home. -“You know I can’t eat after 6, least of all so close to competition”, she answered dryly before continuing her way to her bedroom. As soon as she arrived to her destination, she saw a small package on her bed & while picking up the small gift she saw a simple note that said “To Zhenya-chan”. When she opened carefully the wrapping paper she saw that inside there was a cute necklace of a moon & next to it a note that said   “This is your belated Olympic gift, you’re always gold in our hearts, gambatte Zhenya-chan! With love   M & Y”   She smiled to herself & immediately reached for her phone to write to her boys. When the world looked bleak they always put a smile on her face, this was a reminder of what she held dear, after this there was only one way, she was going to fight for a chance. 	5. Day 24    It was loud on the arena, louder than any normal competition, because this wasn’t any normal competition, this was the World’s Championship. After the Olympics, this was the biggest accomplishment any athlete on her field could get. She had already won it twice & she should be relaxed at this stage by now, but this year, after everything than unraveled, this felt like a test. Is this the end of Evgenia Medvedeva? That’s the question everyone in the media was asking. If she lost, it not only reinforced the idea that Alina had come to take her place, but also it would erase what she accomplished, she would be another story to add to the older figure skater losing her place to someone younger narrative. Maybe Eteri was right & she already reached her peak before the Olympics. For two years, she was on the top of her field, but not anymore & although she was still in the podium she knew it was just a matter of time until one of the juniors of her country became a senior & started making things more complicated for her with quads. She made sure to avoid the media while getting ready for the World’s, she didn’t want anything to distract her from her training, but everyday Eteri informed her of new requests for interviews with Alina. The media was enjoying their rivalry & with Yuzuru not participating at the World Championship, the media made sure to hype the battle of the Russian Ladies as much as they could. But that wasn’t what worried her, but the lack of stability she had been showing during the practice of her jumps. She had tried to convince Eteri to allow her to backload her jumps to catch up to Alina, but she had the last word & she told her that as long as she wasn’t having clean landings, she would continue doing three of her jumps before the second half. She also took out the triple lutz, triple loop combination she had been practicing for her program, which meant that just in technical, she was already several points behind Alina. It seemed like only a miracle could help her retain the title. She took a deep breath & started her routine backstage, practicing her jumps while Exo played in her ipod. This felt like a chronicle of a death foretold, she knew the scores even before she stepped on the ice, she never felt as defeated as today. She saw the girls on her group practicing as she did, Satoko (Miyahara) warmed up flexing her legs while Kaetlyn (Osmond) ran from one corner of the room to the other & Alina practiced her spins in the floor. They all looked focus & ready, while she felt more lost than ever, she tried to put on a brave face but she knew what she was going to be facing, after all she had been seeing Alina’s routine for the last three weeks, while practicing next to her for the World’s Championship. \- “What is the mark of a true champion?”, she remembered the question that Tatyana Tarasova asked her the first time she became a World Champion. That time she answered, “the way they deal with success”, but Tatyana simply said “No, my girl. It’s how they face adversity”. Now, she finally understood the depth of her words. Because for two years, she only knew success & maybe during that time she wasn’t a true champion, because her biggest competition was herself. But now, she wasn’t the one leading the group, instead she was the one that had to catch up. And she knew she only had two options, either fight with all her might or settle & be one of the many, another Russian name that would get lost in obscurity after being replaced by a younger skater. Alina would take her place and then someone younger than Alina would come & the cycle would continue. But she refused to be another disposable name in history, she refused to accept her sacrifices meant nothing to her future, she didn’t want her dream to end when it hadn’t even started. So when she heard one of the officials of the event announce to them that they were going to be next on the presentation of the short program, she knew she had to make a choice. And while all the girls started to put on their skates to get ready to hit the ice, she started thinking about the possibilities of the risky decision that she was about to take. And when she finished tying her laces, she held her moon necklace for strength because she knew she had reached one of the most difficult decisions of her life. 	6. Day 30    The season was over for her, “it couldn’t have ended in a worst note”, she thought while she walked Jerry to the park. Summer was near & while she usually looked forward to practice fun routines for the summer shows & catch up with all the animes she missed during the season, this summer felt drearier than ever. For the first time in two years she had missed the podium, she couldn’t even get bronze & this was her own fault. “I knew it was going to be risky” she said to herself. Her last-minute decision to backload all of her jumps didn’t pay off, her foot was still recovering & her stamina didn’t match Alina’s so she fell in her triple Salchow triple toe loop combination. She also got lower GOEs than usual on her jumps, because her landings kept getting sloppier & to top it all, Eteri was mad at her. She didn’t like her decision of changing her program content without consulting her & even when she managed to make it up in the free program following their original script, it wasn’t enough & she ended up being fourth. She knew she was in trouble when Eteri didn’t sat with her at the Kiss & Cry when her results were shown. And she was paying it now, because Eteri had demoted her to train under Sergei (Dudakov), who worked as her right hand on the Training Center. Eteri only managed the top students, so at the moment her main focus was Alina, while she had to raise to the ranks again if she wanted to be considered. Not that it matter, because her last checkup with her doctor shown that she couldn’t train for a month. Her foot was still recovering & all the competitions she had been participating lately, delayed her rehabilitation process. So, she had to sit for the rest of the season & concentrate in getting better, at least that’s what the doctor said. But could she afford to sit & recover? Because that tactic wasn’t working for Adelina (Sotnikova), who was rumored to be retiring soon. Yulia (Lipnitskaya) had already retired & she seemed to be going into coaching. “But at least they got gold”, her doubts murmured in her head. What did she have? She was just a fading star, one that was dying before she actually had the opportunity to shine. A sudden vibration took her out of her thoughts as she saw a new message on her phone. It was from Misha, since the World Championship ended, Yuzuru, Misha & Wakaba had been her main support, sending her funny messages so she could cheer up. Today, it was a Ryan Gosling meme that said “hey girl, the only thing more marvelous than my abs is your smile”. She smiled at his silly joke & only wrote on the group chat she had with her boys   -“How do you always know how to cheer me up Misha?”   He only answered with another meme, this time it was an image of Yuzuru shirtless with the words   -“Hey girl, keep that smile on, or I’ll put my shirt back on”   She laughed this time, and before she could answer she saw that Yuzuru was writing something too   -“You guys know that I can read everything you write, right?”   Misha wrote back   -“Look at the bright side, your shirtless picture made Janny laugh. Now the question is, if she’s laughing because she’s not impressed by your abs, or because my joke was that funny”   Evgenia joined the banter by writing   -“Couldn’t it be the two options?”   Misha continued   -“Don’t be mean to Yuzu, Janny. Remember that he has an army of fans that can hunt you down”   Evgenia simply answered   -“I know, I’m always afraid I would be attacked by a group of girls holding Pooh bears”   Misha quickly wrote   -“That’s the nightmare of every girl that interacts with Yuzu for more than 10 seconds”   Yuzuru joined their game & he simply put   “Don’t worry Zhenya, you know that as a Sailor Soldier your powers would prevent the attack of any Pooh bear in your vicinity. And if all you needed to cheer up was a picture of abs, here is a picture of me & Misha shirtless”   When Evgenia saw the picture, she couldn’t stop laughing, because for once Yuzu wasn’t the bottom of the jokes & he finally paid back Misha’s constant teasing. While she wiped the laughing tears from her eyes, she realized that this was the reason she would never regret getting into figure skating. Regardless of her results, what she would take with her wasn’t only the memories of her triumphs, but also the friends she made thanks to this profession. With that thought on her mind, she set up to make a meme of her own to make her boys smile, at that moment she felt that sense of happiness for being able to enjoy the little things in life, she felt the smell of the beginning of summer reaching her & bringing her hope that maybe her journey wasn’t over. And if it was, what a ride it was. 	7. Day 50    Getting back on the ice after sustaining a long-term injury was never easy. It had been almost a month since she last came to train & from her last check-up things seemed better with her foot. Of course, the doctor said to avoid doing triples at least for two more weeks, but she could return to the ice to do some step sequences. Sergei watched her from a corner following her every move & checking her speed to review her motions later on. Before she stepped on the ice, they had discussed what type of music she was thinking for the new season. During her time away from the rink, that’s all she was thinking, what she could do to restore her position and what type of music would suit her comeback. She had settle on “Coppelia: Act I – Valse” for her free skate program & “Pulcinella suite: VIIIb. Finale. Allegro assai” for her short program. Sergei seemed satisfied with her choices & he told her she would need extra training this summer to be able to backload her jumps as she wanted. She was happy with those news, because it meant she was going to be able to face Alina in the same conditions, but it also meant she would have to train extra hard to be able to have enough stamina to keep all of her jumps at the end of her program. When she finished her practice, Sergei pointed out that she was still a little bit stiff on the ice, but that was normal considering she had stopped training for several weeks. He also told her about some of the offers she had for the summer shows, including Dreams on Ice in Japan again</li>

She already had a song on mind for that show, it was a song she wanted to use for one of her competition programs, but she wouldn’t be able to use it because she had to use ballet songs if she wanted to compete with Alina, because those songs suited better the programs when there was backloading involved. As she left the gym she saw Alina arriving to the Training Center. Now that it was the beginning of summer & she was working with Sergei, she didn’t see Alina as often as before, because they weren’t working together anymore. She waved to Alina from a distance who waved back, but continued her way into the gym without stopping, she knew why. Eteri didn’t like when her students were late & she knew how harder trainings got when she was in a bad mood, so she didn’t blame her. Today, her mom didn’t pick her up from training because she was busy with some errands, and she was planning to ask her to stop bringing her to the gym in the mornings as well. During her time away from the rink she had started to think about asking her mom to keep her distance from her training, maybe if she stopped getting involved with her figure skating, they could have a more normal mother/ daughter relationship, because right now she felt more like a second coach than a mother. The problem is that she didn’t know how to bring the topic to conversation without hurting her mom’s feelings, she knew that making her successful in figure skating had become their joined goal, but right now at her lowest, she didn’t need someone else pushing her harder to get back on shape, she just needed unconditional support, in other words she needed her mom. While waiting to take the subway back home, she saw a guy wearing the best shirt she ever saw & at that moment she wished Yuzuru was with her because he would be the only one else who could understand the joke. But they lived in opposites sides of the world, so she settled for sharing her discovery with him. Carefully she took her cellphone out of her bag & while pretending to write a message, she subtly took a picture of the shirt of the guy, and smiled to herself while she admired the treasure she found. After zooming the picture and checking that the numbers on the shirt were clear, she sent a message to the group chat she had with Yuzuru & Misha. She couldn’t wait for Yuzu to see the picture & maybe give back to him a little bit of the happiness he gave her while he was trying to cheer her up. At that moment the train stopped on the station & she went inside while putting on her headphones, because today “Unravel” would be the soundtrack that would guide her way back home.</li>

They had just finished the choreography for the “Dreams on Ice” show & while Misha went to change she stayed on the ice practicing by herself. It was rare to have a solo session on the ice, at Eteri’s gym she had to share it with Alina & Polina (Tsurskaya), that’s without counting all the juniors that worked out on that Training Center as well. When she first became a skater, she was in the same position as those girls, looking up to the seniors, dreaming of being on their shoes.</li>

So as soon as they reached the ice, she turned to David unsure if she should share her doubts   -“What’s wrong”, he asked noticing her hesitant expression. -“Maybe it would be better if you start with Javier after all, because I don’t want to bore them watching my program, when I don’t even have any jumps to show them yet”, she expressed nervously. -“It’s too late to do that now, Javier already gave you his training turn. Besides I think they would like what we have done so far”, said David in a kind tone trying to give her some reassurance. -“Maybe we can start adding some of the jumps today”, suggested Evgenia. -“Have you finished training your jumps with Ghislain?”, asked David to bolster his point. -“No, he’s still making me do doubles.</li>

Day 64    It was a lazy day for her because it was her day off from training, she had just returned from her last appointment with her doctor & he let her know her foot was better so she could start working on her jumps again. He did recommend she slept with an ice pack on her foot for the next two weeks to finish her treatment & she had to meet him again by the end of the month to confirm her injury had completely healed. She was happy things were finally looking up, and to top it all she was finally going to be able to work on some choreographies for the summer shows. She already told Daniil (Gleichengauz) she was planning to use “Dark Paradise” from Lana del Rey for the two summer shows she confirmed.</li>

Day 64    Impatience wasn’t an attribute that she was known for, but that was the feeling that she had through the morning before the show. After all, most of her morning consisted in interviews with different members of Japanese media to talk about the show “Dreams on Ice”. And while a part of her appreciated the distraction, because keeping herself busy allowed her to push the problems she wasn’t ready to face under the carpet, she couldn’t help but dread that her last hours in Japan had to be giving interviews instead of spending time with her friends. After all this was going to be the last time she stood on the same ice as Misha, unless he continued doing exhibitions as he had hinted. She wasn’t going to see Wakaba again either until the season started & Ekaterina (Bobrova) one of her few Russian friends was debating her retirement to fulfill her longtime dream of becoming a mother.</li>

Day 64    Training started as it always did for her for the past two weeks, joining a group of skaters as they followed Tracy (Wilson) on the ice.

She could see Gabby trailing behind her, while her brother Zachary adopted a more serious mood on the ice and was fully concentrated on imitating the movements of Tracy along his partner Alison (Schumacher). Cha (Jun-Hwan) stayed closer to Tracy as she explained in a calm manner how every movement they did built agility, balance, coordination & speed. “Remember to listen to your own blade, and follow the sound as the guideline for your movement, forget about how you look & just feel it”, was the instruction that Tracy imparted as they all continued to do the exercises she guided.</li>

Prologue (1)  ** Timeline: **  ** SH: Post-Reichenbach, but does not follow series 3. **  ** MCU: Post-Civil War **  ** Ships: None **  ** Please enjoy! **  Patiently waiting for a case had paid off, because it wasn't long before Lestrade was on the threshold of 221B asking for Sherlock's help in a case. The scene of the death wasn't far so it took a short cab ride of a few minutes for the three of them to get there and the consulting detective was instantly all over the scene before they'd even entered the building. After throwing a few quick insults at Anderson and Donovan, Sherlock led the group headed into the building, up the stairs, and onto the crime scene. As soon as the genius saw the body he got to work, crouching down and examining all possibilities. The DI and the blogger watched on as Sherlock worked intently. The victim had to have been underage, which made the whole situation a bit more solemn. She was lying on her back with her limbs sprawled out, eyes shut peacefully. The teen wore a white  _Shakespeare's Globe Theatre_  t-shirt and maroon gym shorts with the words  _Pygone High School_  on the left pant-leg. Sherlock's eyes processed her clothing then moved on to the clunky metal bracelet she wore. "Well?" Lestrade questioned. "This is definitely worth calling me in for," the genius quickly replied, going over the conditions of her skin. Lestrade ran a hand over his face. "Which means it's stranger than I initially thought. Great." John couldn't help but crack a smile. Sherlock gave the body one last look before standing up. "So what have you gathered?" Sherlock turned to John. "How long would you say she's been dead?" John stepped over to the body and crouched down to get a better look. "Um, about an hour. Not very long, at least." Sherlock began pacing the room. "Which doesn't make sense." "What do you mean?" Lestrade asked. The consulting detective halted and began to explain. "The dust pattern near the door doesn't indicate any entry within the last hour and I've already accounted for us and the witness who found the body, so how did she get in?" he questioned, gesturing around the windowless room. He pointed down to the girl's neck and shoulders. "She also has a sunburn and it isn't exactly a sunny time of year." "She could have been traveling," suggested John. "No, she has sunscreen still clearly visible so she's applied within the last few hours. Not to mention her shoes. She's been dead for around an hour and it's been raining heavily for over two and a half but there's no sign of her having been out in it. There's also evidence of leftover makeup and her manicure is recent, so she cares about her appearance. But look at her clothes – she wouldn't walk around in public like that. Looking at the grass stain pattern on her sneakers and ankles I'd say she was running, but she wasn't going on any planned jog. Dirt on her knees and under her nails indicate she was working outdoors – the pollen on her shorts and bee sting on her leg points to the obvious conclusion of gardening." "Yeah, obvious," Lestrade mumbled sarcastically under his breath. Sherlock either ignored him or simply didn't hear, too far gone in his deductions. "So this teen is working in her garden out in the sun for an extended time and gets burned. Something startles her enough to get her up and running." "Bee sting?" suggested John. "It could have shocked her – caused her to panic some." "Unlikely. If she's an avid gardener she is likely use to stings. It's more possible she saw something or someone that scared her enough to cause her to run. Somehow she ends up here and dies from an electric shock emanating from her bracelet," he finished off with a flourish. John and Lestrade look down at the large, metal bracelet on the teen's wrist. Lestrade lowered his head and shook it. "Poor kid…"  "I take it no ID," said Sherlock, getting close to the body again. "Erm, no. We'll be doing fingerprints and DNA after we finish up here." Sherlock noticed something misshapen about her shirt and reached under, pulling out a phone tucked into the girl's bra. He stood up and waved it at Lestrade. "Here's some identification for you." He took off the case of the iPhone and read off the name engraved on the back. "Juliet Michelson." Sherlock handed the phone off as he began to head out the door. "Oh, and she's also American." Both Lestrade and John looked surprised by deduction. "American?" Lestrade questioned. "Yes, of course. The west, likely. I'd bet on either Nevada or California. _Pygone High School_?" "There are some high schools in the UK," Lestrade defended. "None that are sunny enough to burn someone at this time of year," Sherlock retorted. "I trust you'll keep me updated on anything else you find. I'd also like photographs of the body to examine as well as the bracelet once you're done with it." He left the room and called out behind him. "Come along, John!" The blogger quickly followed. Sherlock was spouting off theories and details as the two exited the building. "One moment she's running from something and next she's in London, dead from electrocution. This is an eight at least!" He clapped his hands together. "Oh, it's Christmas!" Anderson watched gloomily from behind the police tape as the duo hailed a cab and left. He pulled out his cellphone and hit a speed dial. The other end picked up quickly. "Sir, Holmes is getting involved with a case that involves – er – us. Do you want me to tell him? …O-Of course…yes, I will, sir…Thank you, sir." The idiotic "forensic scientist" pocketed his phone with a not-so-happy expression on his face. 	2. Prologue (2)  All was tranquil on Baker Street save it for the frantic rustling of papers as a certain consulting detective pinned news articles, research papers, and photographs on the wall above the couch. Despite it being nearly eleven at night, the genius's mind was racing, refusing to succumb to the body's needs. Yarn was strung between pictures and diagrams. One recurring theme was the symbol on the victim's bracelet. It had been found on two other bodies in the last month – one died of tuberculosis and the other was in a car accident – and it could hardly be a coincidence. John was seated in his usual chair with his laptop open, typing away about the case at hand. It was nearly silent when Sherlock let out a frustrated growl and yanked down a closeup of the symbol. As he began to pace as he stared intently at the picture. John looked up over the edge of his computer and over at his flatmate. "I've seen this somewhere before," Sherlock murmured under his breath, photograph up to his face. He plopped down onto the couch and continued to examine the engraving on the bracelet. He swung his legs up onto the couch, lying his head back onto the arm rest. The genius brought his hands up under his chin. "I'll be heading into my mind palace if you need me." "Not that I'll be able to get your attention," John muttered. The blogger enjoyed the quiet for a mere half hour before Sherlock leapt up off the couch, clutching the photograph in his hand. John looked up at his flatmate. "You find it?" "An icosahedron," Sherlock answered promptly. "Geometric vector often representing water and traits associated to it." "Okay…so what's the importance of the shape?" Sherlock began pacing the floor. "That's what I aim to find out. Three bodies in the last month have been found with this symbol somewhere on their person – a tattoo, a slip of paper, and a bracelet – they have to be connected somehow." "Well, maybe it's some kind of – I dunno – club?" suggested John. "One of the victims was from across the Atlantic," Sherlock reminded. "I doubt they had weekly meetings. No, it's something else." He approached his makeshift evidence board. "How did she end up there?…" Sherlock tapped on one of the photos of the crime scene. "That's the major question." A knock at the threshold caused both men to turn. Mrs. Hudson stood at the door. "Sorry, I think the doorbell's broken again. You've got visitors." "Show them up, Mrs. Hudson." "Thank you," John called out after her as their landlady headed back down the stairs. He shot Sherlock a look. Two men walked up the stairs and into the flat and John stood to greet them. The consulting detective looked over and instantly glared. "What are you doing here," he sneered at Anderson. The man standing in front of the forensic scientist stepped forward. "He's with me," the man stated calmly, folder tucked safely under his arm. Sherlock's eyes narrowed. "American," he noted upon hearing his accent. "You have something about the Michelson case." "You could say that," the man said with a shrug. He extended his hand. "Agent Phil Coulson." After a few awkward moments of Sherlock not accepting the gesture, John shook his hand instead. "Pleasure meeting you," said John. "I'm–"  "Doctor Watson and Sherlock Holmes," Agent Coulson said with a grin. "I'm honoured to finally meet you both." "Who do you work for?" Sherlock said before John could reply. "SHIELD," Coulson answered. "I'm going to assume you've heard of it." "I have." Coulson smiled and nodded. "Then you'll know why I'm here." Sherlock glared. "My original question still stands." He jerked his head towards Anderson. "What is he doing here?" Anderson's hands balled into fists. "It just so happens my boss asked me to come with him." John clearly looked very confused. "I'm sorry – boss?" His eyes flickered between Coulson and Anderson as Sherlock's did the same. Coulson stepped further into the flat and gestured to the couch. "Do you mind if I…?" his question trailed off. "Oh, of course," said John. The agent smiled and nodded in thanks, taking a seat on the piece of furniture. Sherlock took a few moments to stare Anderson down before the forensic scientist huffed and sat down next to Coulson. Sherlock sulked over to his usual seat and studied the two guests intently. John cleared his throat. "You want anything? Tea?" he offered. "No thank you," the agent said kindly. "I'm here on business." "Obviously," Sherlock scoffed. "Now, Agent Coulson, why would the man who assembled the Avengers have a connection to that idiot–" he jerked his head towards Anderson, "– and what do you want with me?" John's eyes went wide and he looked towards Sherlock. Coulson smirked. "They did say you were good." He leaned back into the cushions and folded his hands. "Mr. Holmes, SHIELD has had an eye on you through Agent Anderson for a long time now." John spluttered and even Sherlock looked mildly shocked. "That's why you were never fired," Sherlock concluded after a few moments, "someone of higher power was keeping you in place. Forensic science wasn't your original position considering how awful you were at it." "Of course it wasn't," Anderson shot back. "There was an open position and my superiors needed me on the inside." "Wait," said John, "if you're here on Sherlock's behalf why are you so…" he trailed off, not sure how to phrase the sentence without insulting the man. Anderson rolled his eyes. "Just because I'm required to keep tabs on him doesn't mean I have to like him." He shot the consultant a look. Coulson cleared his throat pointedly and Anderson's mouth snapped shut. He frowned, folding his arms and leaning back into the couch. Coulson turned to look towards Sherlock and John again. "SHIELD wants to offer you a job." "Not interested." "I do believe our proposition will intrigue you." Coulson pulled the folder out from under his arm and stood, handing it over to Sherlock. The genius accepted the file and opened it, flipping through the papers. "You crave puzzles and, let me assure you, mutants provide those." "Juliet Michelson was a mutant, wasn't she?" It was more of a statement than a question. "That's correct," Coulson confirmed. "She had the ability of teleportation." "Which explains why she ended up in another country in seemingly an instant." He looked up from the files. "Thank you for ruining the puzzle for me." Anderson scoffed and both Coulson and Sherlock shot him a look, Sherlock's gaze more aggressive of course. "Mr. Holmes, we need you to find who killed Juliet Michelson – she wasn't the only one. SHIELD has reason to believe the man who died of tuberculosis last week – Jacob Rytrot – was another victim." "The icosahedron links them." Coulson nodded. "We want you to track that organisation down as well as inform us of any mutants that make themselves known. We know you can; you tracked down and dismantled James Moriarty's web with fair ease." "I'd hardly consider it that." Coulson stood and Anderson followed his actions. "Well, if you change your mind and want to take the case, let Anderson or I," he took a card from our of his breast pocket, setting it down on the coffee table, "know." He smiled kindly and he and the undercover agent left. As soon as the sound of the front door closing echoed through the flat John turned around to Sherlock, not sure what to say. "…So…you taking the offer?" he settled on asking. Pensive, Sherlock stared at the card on the table before picking it up and fiddling with it in his hands. He looked up at his evidence board, eyes skimming over all the work he'd done. Eventually, he came to an answer. "Yes." 	3. Mirror Murder  Two weeks after Agent Coulson had stopped by and recruited Sherlock, John found the detective continuing to add the the makeshift evidence board that was still hung up on the wall above the couch. The stroppy detective had been waiting for a new case and nothing had arisen, leading him to fall into one of his bad moods. Not a whole lot of new information had come up regarding the Michelson case and the trail had gone cold; the fact that it was unsolved aggravated the detective every day. John was reaching his limit listening to Sherlock complain when Lestrade stopped by with a case to save the day. There was a murder in South London and it looked anything but normal. Sherlock, John, and Lestrade sat in 221B examining photos of the crime scene. "When we showed up the dust stirred, erasing what little strange evidence we did have," Lestrade explained. He handed Sherlock a picture. "But we managed to snap a few pictures." The victim was lying face down on the floor with evidence of a scuffle around him. To and from the body, imprinted in the dust and dirt, were footprints. The other photos went to show that the footprints led to and from a large mirror on the wall. "Victim's name was Evan Warren. Locked room," said Lestrade, "no signs of forced entry and there were no windows." Sherlock continued to flip through the pictures. "What do you make of it?" Sherlock slapped down the photographs. "I take it the body's been taken to the morgue." "It has." Sherlock stood and walked over to the hook which he jacket hung. Along the way he shrugged off his robe and it landed soundlessly on the floor</li>

The pathologist pulled back the cloth over the body and Sherlock instantly got to work. _Cause of death: Knife wound to throat_  _Owner of two cats_  _Recently divorced_  _Works indoors (desk job)_  _Icosahedron tattoo_  Sherlock halted and stared at the victim's left arm. "John…"  The doctor looked over and froze. "It's the same symbol." "What, so he's connected to the Michelson murder?" John questioned. "He's related somehow." He pointed to where the tattoo was placed – which was the inner-forearm. "This tattoo is in the same part of the body as Garret Vales." "What, the man who died in the car accident a while back?" "That's the one." The duo stared at the body for a few moments longer. "I need to find what this symbol represents," Sherlock determined, "it's the keystone to the problem. Once I figure out what it means everything else should fall into place." He turned and quickly walked to the door. John began to follow before calling out behind him," Thank you, Molly." The pathologist shook her head. "No problem…"  -/:\\-/:\\-/:\\-/:\\-/:\\-/:\\-/:\\-/:\\-/:\\-/:\\-/:\\-/:\\-/:\\-/:\\-/:\\-/:\\-/:\\-  The next day John found Sherlock continuing to stare at the evidence board on the wall (to which the new photographs had been added). The blogger picked up the news article lying on the table. The headline read:  **Mysterious locked room murder! A killer that can walk through walls? **  John held up the paper for Sherlock to see. "You take a look at this?" he questioned. Sherlock briefly glanced over his shoulder then went back to his work. "Yes, the papers do always seem to exaggerate, don't they?" John set the paper down on the table again. "Well, maybe they aren't exaggerating – well, unknowingly. Who knows? Maybe this killer really can walk through walls." There was a long silence between the two and for a while John had simply concluded the detective had ignored him. Then Sherlock turned around. "John, you're brilliant." "Hm?" Sherlock dashed to the photographs of the latest crime and took them down from the wall and examined them closely. "The footprints, John. There's no doubt the killer was a mutant – the chances they weren't are extremely low – so it's quite likely they used their abilities to commit the crime." He walked quickly over to his flatmate and pointed the photos. "The footprints, look at the footprints!" John took the picture from Sherlock's hand and his eyes skimmed over it. "They're to and from the mirror…" He raised an eyebrow at the detective. "You aren't seriously suggesting–"  "I was hardly the one who suggested it John," Sherlock pointed out, gesturing to the newspaper. The sound of thudding footsteps on the staircase caused both men to turn. Lestrade soon stood in the doorway. "There's been a second killing," Sherlock said, before the DI could speak. Lestrade simply nodded. "And it was exactly the same?" "Yes." "Identical?" "Of course." "Did he have the same tattoo as the last victim?" "Yes." "We're the footprints just as the last murder?" "What?" "The footprints, Lestrade!" "Er, yeah," he said. "Yeah, the only sign of someone else in the room was near the body and a mirror." Sherlock clapped his hands together and grinned manically. "Yes! Perfect!" He took the photos back from John and headed over to the evidence board and began pinning them up again. "I won't be needing to take at the crime scene, Inspector, I've nearly figured it out." Lestrade nodded slowly. "Right…" He cleared his throat. "In that case I'll be off. Sent me a message when you've got it, yeah?" "Of course." Lestrade gave John a smile and went back out of the flat. John turned to his flatmate. "You've nearly figured it out?" he questioned. Sherlock was looking back and forth between his evidence wall and the fireplace. "Yes, of course. Didn't you hear me?" He rushed over to the fireplace and began readjusting the mirror that hung over it. He looked over his shoulder, trying to find the right angle. "I suspect we'll have the killer soon." "You do?" John asked. Sherlock walked over to the couch and stood in front of it, staring into the mirror. "If he follows his pattern of associating with the icosahedron, which I'm certain he will." He grinned at his flatmate. "Tonight would be a good night to do it." "Do what, exactly?" "Come after me," answered Sherlock, as if it were the most obvious thing in the world. "I'm sorry, what?" John questioned in shock. "Why would you be a target?" Sherlock placed his hands under his chin in his classic ' _thinking pose_.' "John, go stand directly in front of the fireplace." John humphed but did as the detective asked. He turned around to face Sherlock. "Now," the detective stepped to the side, "if you're looking straight ahead, what do you see?" John looked over at the evidence wall. "All the pictures, papers, and maps you put up." "But specifically…?" "Um…the photos of the crime scene and the tattoo." Sherlock grinned. "Exactly." John's eyes widened. "What, you mean you're  _trying_  to attract the killer?" Sherlock shrugged. "Yes, so we can restrain him, of course." John shook his head and ran a hand over his face. "If you want to summon a murdering superhuman that's on you." He snatched up his phone and began heading up the stairs to his room. -/:\\-/:\\-/:\\-/:\\-/:\\-/:\\-/:\\-/:\\-/:\\-/:\\-/:\\-/:\\-/:\\-/:\\-/:\\-/:\\-/:\\-  That night was eventful. John had nearly drifted off to sleep several times, only to be awoken by noises from downstairs. By midnight he was a little more than angry at the consulting detective and marched downstairs to give his flatmate a good talking to. When he entered the living room for a moment Sherlock couldn't be found. However, the blogger quickly located the detective in the kitchen. Before John could even get anything out of his mouth, Sherlock spoke. "John, it shouldn't be much longer." The doctor folded his arms. "Much longer before what?" Sherlock looked over at John. "The killer makes himself known." John sighed and rolled his eyes. "Of herself," Sherlock said (mostly to himself), "although the murderer being male is statistically more likely–"  "Sherlock, even you need sleep sometimes," John interrupted. Sherlock's gaze drifted over to the living room. "John." "No, Sherlock," the doctor persisted, "you actually need to take into account what your body needs for once." "John–"  "I don't care if it's 'transport,' it's what keeping you going on your feet, so you'd better get to sleep tonight or so help me–"  Sherlock stood, abruptly cutting off his flatmate's rant. "John!" The blogger noticed where his friend's line of eyesight was and turned around. There stood a man in their living room, pulling his hand out of the mirror. The towering man glowered down on the two. "What do you know about that symbol?" he questioned, jerking his head towards the evidence board. John's eyes flickered between the photos and the mutant in the room. On the other hand, Sherlock was surprisingly collected. "Just about nothing," he confessed. John turned to his friend in shock. "I was hoping you would enlighten us." "You're a copper," the man accused. Sherlock scoffed and rolled his eyes. "Hardly. And you're the man who killed Evan Warren." The man seemed to growl. "That monster deserved to die." "Why?" "I ain't tellin' you!" The killer lunged for Sherlock who ducked out of the way. "John, the mirror!" Sherlock called out. Both John and the killer looked over at the the mirror where the murderer had come from. Catching Sherlock's train of thought, John leapt for the fire pokers, snatched one up, and smashed it into the mirror, causing it to killer yelled out in anger and abandoned his attempt on Sherlock and moved on to John. He pulled a knife from his pocket, ready to strike. Luckily, he was completely inexperienced and up against a soldier so John easily disarmed the man. Two against one could hardly be considered fair, but the tenants of 221B overpowered the mutant, rendering him unconscious. Sherlock scoffed. "Amateur," he mumbled under his breath. -/:\\-/:\\-/:\\-/:\\-/:\\-/:\\-/:\\-/:\\-/:\\-/:\\-/:\\-/:\\-/:\\-/:\\-/:\\-/:\\-/:\\-  "So, how'd he know to come and get you?" Lestrade questioned as some other cops ushered the man away in handcuffs. "Must've caught wind I was on the case," Sherlock said with a shrug. "I'm easier to find than a cop." Lestrade had his 'I-know-you're-lying-to-me-but-I'm-simply-not-going-to-question-it' face and John understood the facial cue. He cleared his throat. "Thank you though, for coming to help us out," he said. The inspector sighed. "Not a problem – I would've ended up with him anyway." He thanked the two again and trotted down the stairs. As Lestrade headed down, Anderson came on up. Sherlock's eyes narrowed. "Why are you here?" he sneered. "You know very well why," Anderson snapped back. He paused the jerked his head down the stairs. "SHIELD will take care of this." "Of course," John cut in before Sherlock could throw any more insults around. "Keep him away from mirrors. We don't think he can travel through all reflections, but definitely mirrors." He glanced over at the mess of glass on the floor and on the mantel. Anderson nodded. "Yeah, we'll make sure of that." Without anything more he turned on his heel and left, determined to leave the flat. John looked over to Sherlock who walked over the window and watched the cop cars drive off. The doctor couldn't exactly think of anything to say, then decided there was nothing to be said and went upstairs into his room. 	4. How 'Bout That Weather? Considering it was November, it was quite warm in London. In fact, unnaturally warm. There hadn't been a single snowfall yet and it was beginning to baffle meteorologists. Not that Sherlock Holmes was interested in such trivial things as the weather. That was, until it started affecting him. The temperature continued to rise rather than fall as it should, and in the middle of November, it was too hot for Sherlock to wear the coat or scarf. It was making him grumpy and soon he searched for answers to no avail. The entire world was baffled that only England was affected by what several people claimed to be global warming. It just wasn't right. Luckily, answers surfaced after a week of torture. Sherlock's phone which sat on the table in the living room began to ring. John was sitting across from it and looked over the top of his laptop at it. Sherlock came in from the kitchen where he was conducting an experiment and answered it. "Sherlock Holmes." _ "It's Coulson – I think I've got something for you to look into." _  "The weather, yes?" _ "Yes. It's unnatural on its own, then SHIELD pinpointed an epicentre. I'm sending you the info now." _ Sherlock's phone chimed and he took it down from his ear, opening the file that had just been sent to him. "Who was that?" John asked. "Agent Coulson." Sherlock's eyes scanned over the map on his phone. "He has a case for us." The blogger sat up straighter. "Oh?" "The weather," Sherlock replied. He pocketed his phone and headed for the door. "SHIELD believes there is something or someone causing it," he stopped at the doorway and turned back, "and we're going to find out what." -/:\\-/:\\-/:\\-/:\\-/:\\-/:\\-/:\\-/:\\-/:\\-/:\\-/:\\-/:\\-/:\\-/:\\-/:\\-/:\\-/:\\-  Sherlock double checked his phone as he and John approached an old warehouse on the outskirts of the city. It was quite warm and it was only getting hotter the closer the two got to the building. John couldn't understand how Sherlock was still upright in the suit he was wearing. "This should be it," said the detective, looking up at the warehouse. He turned to John. "Have you got your gun?" "Of course I have my gun," John mumbled, pulling it out from his jeans. Sherlock smirked. "Well, let's bring the weather to order." He pushed the door open and silently entered the building, John backing him up. Near the center of the warehouse, there was a figure kneeling on the ground, curled up on themselves. Sherlock and John shared a look. "Hello?" John called out. The figure stiffened then turned around. The man had a thin layer of sweat on his skin and was shaking. As soon as his manic eyes landed on the gun in John's hands he began to scramble away. John realised his mistake and stowed his weapon away. "What's your name?" questioned Sherlock, putting out a hand and cautiously approaching. The man gaped for a couple of moments before responding. "R-Ross." Sherlock nodded. "Ross, do you understand what's going on?" "I'm one of them…" he muttered. "No, I'm one of them!" He curled further in on himself. John stepped forward. "What do you mean one of them?" he asked. He had nearly reached the panicking man. "I'm a – I'm a mutant. I-I didn't…" Ross looked down at himself and shook. "I'm not…human." John kneeled down next to the man. "Yes you are," he insisted. "You are no less human than he or I are," he said, gesturing to Sherlock. "I didn't think I'd have it, I–" he cut off with a sob. "God, my kids!" He grabbed his head. "My kids might be – might be…" Ross lowered his head into his knees, sobbing. Cautiously, John put a hand on the man's shoulder. Ross flinched but otherwise didn't react. "You have kids?" Ross nodded, face still in his knees. "They need their father, don't they?" Ross shook his head. "Not me – not a monster like me." "You are not a monster," John said firmly. "There are people in the world just like you – you aren't alone." Ross raised his head and ran a hand over his tear-filled eyes. "Even though my mother…I thought I wouldn't have it," he muttered. "I-I didn't think it was genetic." Ross looked up at John in fear</li>

"Then they'll need you even more," he said softly. Something must have struck a chord with the panicking inhuman because the surrounding air became noticeably cooler. John turned around and made eye contact with Sherlock. The detective nodded, encouraging John to keep doing what he was doing. John turned back to Ross. "How old are your kids?" he asked. "Five and ten," Ross mumbled. "They need their father," John insisted. Ross nodded, staring at the ground. "Little Rosie must be so scared," muttered Ross, clasping his hands together. "Is that your daughter?" John asked softly. Ross smiled. "Yes. She's a sweetheart. I-I told her brother to take care of her." Ross looked back up at John. "But I should do that." That was the breakthrough. A gust of freezing air swept through the warehouse and the temperature instantly felt as it should. As he did all he could to prevent his teeth from chattering, John helped Ross to his feet. Ross broke down into tears and fell into the blogger. John caught the younger man and kept him upright. "How 'bout we get you a cab, alright?" John led Ross out of the building with Sherlock trailing behind. After John had hailed a cab for Ross and handed him enough money to cover the fare, Sherlock cleared his throat. "What you did, that-that was…"  John gave a sad sort of smile and looked up at his friend. "Yeah, it was good." Sherlock nodded. "We'll inform SHIELD of him, of course." "Of course," John agreed with a nod. "But we should make sure they don't bother him. He's been through enough right now." Sherlock simply 'hmm'ed in response. He looked over at John who was shivering. "I suppose we should head back to the flat and contact Agent Coulson." "Yes, that sounds like a plan." Sherlock looked up and saw that snow was beginning to fall. He smirked a bit. "Looks like London's getting its first snowfall of the season," he said as he hailed a cab. "Yeah, well it's a little late if you ask me," John commented. The two snickered as a cab pulled up to the curb. With satisfied smiles on their faces, the detective and the blogger headed home.</li>

Prologue (1)  Sherlock had finally pestered the nurses enough that they left him alone. He'd gotten away with nothing more than bruises. Several large, deep, and extremely painful bruises, but simply bruises nonetheless. Stephen was a little less lucky. His gash had to be restitched and he ended up needing a blood transfusion. All the doctors had said it was a good thing they'd gotten him to the hospital in time – apparently the blow he received from the SIP agent had caused some internal bleeding and he definitely had an infection from the original wound. Sherlock and John sat around in Stephen's hospital room, trying to figure out what to do next. A figure in the hall came careening through the door and screeching to a halt. "Sherlock!" Greg said breathlessly. "I was just at your flat. What happened? The lady at the front desk said your brother was—" He then caught sight of Stephen and paled significantly.</li>

Sherlock was out on a case and wouldn't be back until late, leaving John alone at 221B. He'd asked his friend if he should meet him at the crime scene after work but Sherlock declined. John didn't feel too bad being left out – it was nice to get a break. However, his break didn't last very long. Upon hearing an unusual noise in the sitting room John turned around and found something…strange. A swirling circle of golden light was forming right next to the fireplace. Out from it tumbled a figure that looked all too familiar. John quickly got to his feet and the portal vanished, leaving the man on the floor and barely moving. John kneeled down next to the body and grabbed his shoulder, giving a slight gasp when he saw his face. "Sherlock? Sherlock, can you hear me?" But something wasn't right.</li>

Prologue (1)  No matter how high and mighty he acted and how great his façade tended to be Sherlock could never cover up the fact that he was not a fan of overseas flights. He hadn't been across the pond in a long time, so when Phil Coulson showed up out of the blue and asked them to get on the next plane, both he and John were a bit taken off guard. Nevertheless, the detective and the doctor complied and found themselves on the next flight to New York City. Coulson wouldn't tell them why they were going, just that they were headed to SHIELD. When the three of them landed a vehicle was waiting for them. Inside the car was another agent. "Mr. Holmes. Doctor Watson." She stuck out her hand. "Agent Maria Hill." Both Londoners shook her hand in turn. "I'm glad you could make it." Well we hardly had any choice in the matter," said Sherlock.</li>

Walking back into the kitchen to finish making his tea, John continued listening to the report. _ "Several eyewitnesses claim the boats were taken down by some sort of creature," _  the reporter continued. John raised an eyebrow and turned to look at his flatmate who was staring intently into his microscope. "Well, that sounds like a hoax." He waited for a response from Sherlock but when he didn't get one he continued. "Sound like something you'd be interested in? Solving the case of the Loch Thames Monster?" John chuckled to himself.

Prologue (1)  It had been about a year since Sherlock Holmes and John Watson were first introduced to the world of SHIELD, superhumans, and secret organizations. John had to admit, life had definitely gotten a lot more interesting since then – and more complicated. Since Agent Phil Coulson showed up in 221B, John had talked down inhumans from blowing their powers out of proportion, become friends (Friends? Acquaintances? That was still up in the air) with a teen addict who could shapeshift into monsters, he'd time traveled, been a telepath for a day, and met two Avengers. And that was by no means all of it. One thing that had not yet happened to Doctor Watson, however, was being asked to do something in the name of SHIELD. Did he expect to? One day, of course, he was an agent after all. The day just came up on him a little quicker than he would have guessed.</li>

He handed Sherlock a photograph of a symbol carved into a desk. "That was there at the first and second robbery but each bank was held up by different people." "So an organisation," Sherlock drawled. "Really, Lestrade, you're getting dafter every case." Lestrade chose to ignore the insult. "Here's the thing, though," he said. "Both men have no memory of the incident." "What, of robbing the bank?" John questioned. "They're lying," snapped Sherlock, "there's video evidence." Lestrade sighed and opened the door to the interrogation area. "Sherlock, we hooked each one up to a polygraph." The detective stopped short. "That's why I brought you in." Sherlock and John exchanged a glance. Sherlock closed his eyes for a moment.
