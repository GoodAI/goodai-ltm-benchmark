Day 1    The medal felt heavy on her neck, but the weight of the situation she found herself in weighted more. She tried to smile looking at her training partner on her side, Alina was wearing the gold medal, she had been wearing the gold medal in every competition the last couple of months & although she wanted to be happy for her, she couldn’t help but think in how this would affect her future. Just in their training team with Eteri they had two young girls doing quads, she couldn’t even perfect the triple lutz, how she was going to manage to get to that level in the years to come. “Silver medal is a big achievement”, she tried to tell herself, but the truth is that it felt like a death sentence. It felt like the ending of an unsatisfying journey, she knew the reality of her country in her field, everyday there was a new girl, training as hard as her, younger & better than her. She felt like an used car just waiting to be discarded. An old model who knew her time was up. She had been dedicating her whole life to a sport just to lose it in a matter of minutes, she wanted to be hopeful, to have faith in herself but her last year as a senior was taking a toll on her. She was not only physically exhausted, but also mentally and emotionally tired, “and the season hasn’t even ended yet”, she reminded herself. She still had the Worlds to focus on & she wasn’t sure she could beat Alina there, she wasn’t sure if she would be able to beat her ever again, that’s how crushed she felt. While the anthem of the Olympics played, she saw Eteri from a distance looking at her & Alina, she had a calm expression on her face, saving her thoughts to herself about their results. Eteri had been her coach since she was 6 & although she was friends with her mom & a mentor to her, she never played favourites, she had to earn her respect with every training & every performance. But she knew that now that she lost 2 competitions in a row to Alina, things weren’t looking good for her, especially because soon her competition was going to be tougher with Anna (Scherbakova) & Alexandra (Trusova) close to making their senior debuts. After the medal ceremony ended at Pyeong Chang, Evgenia returned quickly to Eteri’s side while Alina walked slowly behind her. They had to start getting ready for the gala, if she was honest with herself, she didn’t want to participate, she just wanted to be alone, maybe put some ice on her foot that was still not completely healed. She wished she could sleep until the end of the season, if she won gold she could afford to miss the Worlds, but she didn’t, so she had to work hard to maintain herself relevant. But would it be worth it? In two to three years she would have to compete with little girls who could do quads in their sleep. The future look depressing whenever she thought about it. While returning to their hotel to change for practices, Evgenia put on her headphones to avoid interacting with anyone, both Alina & Eteri had been quiet after the ceremony, but that wasn’t rare, Alina was a quiet girl by nature & Eteri wasn’t that talkative either, only during practice she was blunt, after that she only talked when necessary. Normally, she would take on the job of filling the silence, but today she didn’t want to talk, she just wanted to sulk & listen to some music. So she got lost in the music of EXO & closed her eyes. Two hours later they were at the rink, getting ready to practice their exhibition numbers, Evgenia was getting ready to hit the ice when Eteri stopped her. -“Alina is going first today”, she said softly but sternly. Evgenia looked at her atonished before asking why. Eteri simply said, “you know why”, before walking to Alina’s side to give her some instructions. Evgenia waited outside the rink while Alina worked with Eteri on her “Afro Blue” exhibition number, but she wasn’t looking at Alina, instead she was going through the steps of her program on her mind, remembering each step, trying to analyze how to make her program more complex so it could be more competitive. This was her life, one competition at a time, a whole life dedicated to a sport so it could be reduced to 4 minutes of the world watching & judging. When it was her turn & she stepped to the ice, she closed her eyes to get ready for the same program she had at the exhibitions of the European Championships, it was going to be “Kukushka”, the song that represented her journey, the song that represented how she felt at that moment. She tried to put everything behind her, “don’t look back” she said to herself, she opened her eyes & started everything again. 	2. Day 2    When she opened her eyes, she knew she didn’t felt ready for a new day, the day before it had been the medal ceremony & also her first day of practice for the Exhibition Gala of the Olympics. She practiced with all her heart, she jumped until her legs felt numb because she wanted to tire her body, she wanted to feel tired enough to quiet the doubts of her mind, so she could sleep in peace, so she didn’t fear the uncertainty of her future. The alarm of her cellphone went off at that second reminding her she only had 30 minutes to get ready. They had to leave in one hour to the main rink at Gangneung to practice with the rest of the athletes for their group number at the Gala. This put a smile on her face, she was going to see Misha & Yuzuru there, it still broke her heart that Wakaba wasn’t able to make it to the Olympics, she could have used one of her hugs right now. Checking the clock on her cellphone she realized she lost too much time lost in her thoughts, so she quickly left her bed to start her day. Two hours later she couldn’t stop smiling watching everyone enjoying the practice for the Gala. Everyone at the rink was in a good mood, no one thought about what was going to happen in their futures after the Olympics, they stopped thinking about their falls & mistakes, about the ones who would retire after the Gala, at that moment they were all kids at the playground & that playground was the ice. Just like her, everyone at the rink had dedicated their lives to this sport, to this dream & at that moment she felt ashamed of herself, for not feeling it was enough. Just being here it was a dream, how many girls wanted to be in her position, Wakaba herself couldn’t get a spot on her team, so what if she didn’t win gold, she gave her all. “But my all wasn’t enough” whispered the doubts on her mind. Today it wasn’t about thinking about her failures, today she was going to enjoy the moment, so she put a smile on her face, the same smile that didn’t reach her heart, but it didn’t matter, because even if she felt empty inside, she was going to enjoy this day, she was going to create memories she would treasure for the rest of her life. -“Do you want to do a jump competition?” asked a playful voice next to her, distracting her from her thoughts. She turned her head to see Misha smiling at her & she laughed before joining his playful mood to say   \- “I don’t know, I don’t want you to get hurt, we all know joints start to ache at 26”. He laughed before continuing their game   \- “Are you calling me old Medvedeva”. She put on her best poker face before saying   -“So it’s not only your joints that hurt, you’re also bad at hearing, I feel so sorry for you Misha”. Immediately after saying that, she felt his hands on her hips & she felt her weight leaving the ice before she realized Misha was carrying her & laughing loudly. -“Put me down Misha” she said a little bit scared. \- “Don’t worry, I had a big breakfast, so I’m still strong” he said with a smile. -“Are you guys going to try pair figure skating now?” asked a voice next to them, that belonged to the Yuzuru Hanyu, someone Evgenia still couldn’t believe she was able to call a friend. -“Why, are you jealous?” asked Misha, “don’t believe I forgot how Ondrej (Hotarek) carried you yesterday”, he said joking, while carefully putting Evgenia back on the ice. \- “Ondrej carried this kid?” asked Zhenya with a smile. -“Everybody wants to carry me because I’m cute” joked Yuzuru. \- “I always knew that Ondrej was one of your fangirls” teased Evgenia. \- “Maybe he would get you a new Pooh bear” said Misha, joining Evgenia on her teasing. Yuzuru just laughed as he always did & Evgenia couldn’t help but think how lucky she was to be able to share this kind of moments with them. “Treasure this moments because they are not going to last”, said the treacherous voice on her head, but she refused to listen, not today, she said to herself. “Today my fears are not going to take over”, she repeated as a mantra on her mind. So to quiet her doubts, she skated close to Yuzuru & Misha and asked “so, are you ready for this jump competition?”. 	3. Day 3    The night of the Gala felt like a pause on her life. Like time had stop over to give her a break. She walked around backstage excited of seeing everyone while they got ready. It was strange to not feel nerves, but tonight it wasn’t a competition, tonight it was about enjoying the ice. Performing was what she had done through her whole life, bringing joy to people through her hardwork it was an indescribable feeling, a feeling she didn’t want to give up. -“You look happy” said a voice behind her. She turned & saw Yuzuru looking at her. He had a smile on his face, because Yuzuru without a smile wasn’t the Yuzuru she knew. -“I’m happy to see everyone happy” she said a little bit shyly, she always felt timid when she was alone with Yuzuru, it was easier when Misha was around, but being alone with him made her nervous. -“I like your outfit” he said, before picking her hood & putting it on her head. \- “We can exchange outfits if you want” she said smiling while putting her hood back in its place, “I’m sure the feathers would suit me better than you”. \- “I don’t know” he answered, “no one is as badass as you”. Evgenia stayed silent because she didn’t know how to answer. It was easy to go for the joke, but when he was earnest, he destroyed all of her walls. -“I wanted to congratulate you” he said softly, taking a step closer to her. \- “For what” she asked quietly. \- “Getting silver of course” he said gently & she felt the understanding on his voice. -“Thank you” she said while looking at the floor “but you’re the one that should get all the praises, two golds is not a small feature Yuzuru”. -“You don’t have to pretend” he said in a whisper & she felt the air leaving her lungs as if someone had punched her. “I know it’s hard, what you did that day, it’s worth more than a medal, you’re a champion Zhenya, never forget it” he said carefully. She looked up not caring anymore he would see the tears in her eyes & she saw the surprise on his face when she went for a hug. -“I’m sorry” she said softly in his arms, she tried to let go because she had acted on impulse, but she felt him hugging her even tighter. \- “Don’t apologize, we all need a hug sometimes” he told her gently finally letting go. -“I know those hugs are exclusive for Pooh-san” she joked while wiping the tears from her eyes. -“He told me he can share the hugs with you & with Luna-chan” he told her in a voice that warmed her heart, she was no match for him, her heart ran wild & beat harder than ever, so she said in a whisper “I think I’m ok with that”. During the rest of the evening she could feel the eyes of Yuzuru following her at times, she knew she surprised him with the hug. They have hugged before but this was different because this time it felt like he was consoling her, so it felt more intimate. She tried to calm herself as she always did, with skating, she started going back on the steps for her program on her mind, she repeated the choreography on loop on her memory while listening to Kukushka on her ipod. She usually listened to Exo before the competitions but tonight she wasn’t competing, she wasn’t even performing, because she wasn’t planning to portray anyone but herself through her program, she was going to express something she couldn’t put into words, something she felt in her heart. This is what skating was for her, not only the sport that she dedicated her life to, but also the place where she could be herself. Even when she played a character there was always a little bit of herself in every show, in every step, in every turn & in every jump. Tonight, her heart was going to stay on the ice. She stayed close to the rink when Gabriella & Guillaume took the ice. She had been watching everyone’s program, from Javier’s fun “Aerobic class” to the romantic performance of Han & Sui with “Run”. She wanted to take it all, because this moment with everyone relaxing & smiling was rare, in less than a month they had to be in Milan for the World Championships & she wasn’t looking forward to it. This would be the last day to relax before she started training for her next competition. That had been her routine for the last four years, competitions during the winter & fall seasons and shows & training through the summer. Time passed by, people changed but ice was always there, as a permanent feature on her life. As she saw Gabriella & Guillaume finish their performance to “Pray you catch me” she got ready to be next. It was always difficult to get back to perform for an audience after a disappointing result in competition, especially when it was an exhibition that relied more in engaging the audience than just concentrating in the technical side of her program. Luckily, she didn’t have to smile or be flirty for “Kukushka”, the dark themes of the song suited the state of her soul at the moment, so it was easy to get lost in the tempo of the song. She skated slowly to the center of the rink after Gabriella & Guillaume left the ice, she could see the flashes, hear the announcer calling her name, she could feel the eyes of every person in the arena, but at that moment she erased them all. This was not a performance for them, this was for herself. To remind herself why she still dedicated her life to this profession, why even after the biggest disappointment in her life she couldn’t imagine doing anything else but going back to what she knew. This was who she is & this was what she wanted to continue doing for as long as she could. She closed her eyes & when she heard the first notes of the song, she felt ready to tell a story through her art again. 	4. Day 15    She could feel every muscle in her body ache at the end of her practice, she had one more week to train before the World Figure Skating Championship started & her goal of revalidating her gold medal there seemed to be more far away than ever</li>

                                <li><b><font color="#659936">Test (2024-08-16 14:07:38.920009):</font></b> 2nd page:<br><br>-“Evgenia”, she heard the voice of Eteri calling her. She skated slowly to the end of the rink where she was standing to hear the reviews of her training. -“Your landings are off” she said severely, “if you don’t have secure landings, you cannot do the combinations”, she reminded her. “You need to stay later tomorrow to practice if you want to catch up to Alina”, she said sternly before turning & walking down to her office. This was common with Eteri, always pointing down the mistakes, but never praising her skaters when things went well, she should be used by now, but sometimes she wished she could get a word of encouragement. She turned to the ice & saw Alina leaving the rink quietly. -“Are you alright?” asked Alina as soon as she reached her. -“Yes, thank you. I’m just tired”, answered Zhenya before walking to the dressing rooms to pick her things so she could go home. As she left the gym, she saw her mom’s car in the parking lot. She always made time to take her to trainings & pick her up everyday, that’s why she felt she had no right to complain. Her mom had already sacrificed enough to make her dreams come true, so the least she could do is to deliver in what has become the dream of both of them. -”Hey honey, how was practice?”, her mom asked as soon as she got in the car. -“It was good, I feel I’m improving” she said without looking at her mom in the eyes while pretending to be busy with her phone. That was a bad habit she had, everytime she felt she couldn’t be honest, she looked at the floor or anywhere else to avoid the eyes of the person she couldn't be sincere to. Wakaba once told her that the expressiveness of her face was her biggest curse but also her biggest weapon. On the ice it was a great help when she needed to portray a character, but on real life it presented a problem because it meant anyone could read her like a book. -“Eteri called me this morning” said her mom, taking her out of her thoughts. -“Why?”, she asked softly, fearing her answer   -“She told me you are having problems with your landings & she’s worried”, she told her while starting the car   Evgenia didn’t answer, didn’t confirm her mom’s suspicions because if she vocalized her fears, she knew she would crumble, so she stayed silent until her mom spoke again. -“Eteri said that there are only two reasons this could be happening & let’s hope it’s not the worst case scenario” she told her in a tone that worried her   -“what is the worst case scenario?”, she asked with fear   -“Skaters start to lose precision & flexibility with age, you’re getting older so it’s normal you cannot jump as easily as other skaters younger than you, the problem is that this would mean you already reached your peak” she said in a straight tone. When her mom put the facts so bluntly she really hated to be the daughter of a former figure skater, if her mom had been just a housewife like Alina’s grandmother maybe she could be more supportive. But that wasn’t the nature of her mom, she always went straight to the point, which might be the reason why she was close with Eteri, they were both painfully frank. -“what is the best case scenario?” she asked hopefully   -“that you might be injured” she answered candidly. Evgenia felt the tears in her eyes, but held it together & simply said   -“then let’s hope for the best case scenario” before putting on her headphones on & staying silent until they reached home. As soon as she reached the apartment she shared with her mom, she took her shoes off & started walking to her bedroom but the voice of her mother made her stop   -“You don’t want dinner?” her mom asked while closing the door of their home. -“You know I can’t eat after 6, least of all so close to competition”, she answered dryly before continuing her way to her bedroom. As soon as she arrived to her destination, she saw a small package on her bed & while picking up the small gift she saw a simple note that said “To Zhenya-chan”. When she opened carefully the wrapping paper she saw that inside there was a cute necklace of a moon & next to it a note that said   “This is your belated Olympic gift, you’re always gold in our hearts, gambatte Zhenya-chan! With love   M & Y”   She smiled to herself & immediately reached for her phone to write to her boys. When the world looked bleak they always put a smile on her face, this was a reminder of what she held dear, after this there was only one way, she was going to fight for a chance. 	5. Day 24    It was loud on the arena, louder than any normal competition, because this wasn’t any normal competition, this was the World’s Championship. After the Olympics, this was the biggest accomplishment any athlete on her field could get. She had already won it twice & she should be relaxed at this stage by now, but this year, after everything than unraveled, this felt like a test. Is this the end of Evgenia Medvedeva? That’s the question everyone in the media was asking. If she lost, it not only reinforced the idea that Alina had come to take her place, but also it would erase what she accomplished, she would be another story to add to the older figure skater losing her place to someone younger narrative. Maybe Eteri was right & she already reached her peak before the Olympics. For two years, she was on the top of her field, but not anymore & although she was still in the podium she knew it was just a matter of time until one of the juniors of her country became a senior & started making things more complicated for her with quads. She made sure to avoid the media while getting ready for the World’s, she didn’t want anything to distract her from her training, but everyday Eteri informed her of new requests for interviews with Alina. The media was enjoying their rivalry & with Yuzuru not participating at the World Championship, the media made sure to hype the battle of the Russian Ladies as much as they could. But that wasn’t what worried her, but the lack of stability she had been showing during the practice of her jumps. She had tried to convince Eteri to allow her to backload her jumps to catch up to Alina, but she had the last word & she told her that as long as she wasn’t having clean landings, she would continue doing three of her jumps before the second half. She also took out the triple lutz, triple loop combination she had been practicing for her program, which meant that just in technical, she was already several points behind Alina. It seemed like only a miracle could help her retain the title. She took a deep breath & started her routine backstage, practicing her jumps while Exo played in her ipod. This felt like a chronicle of a death foretold, she knew the scores even before she stepped on the ice, she never felt as defeated as today. She saw the girls on her group practicing as she did, Satoko (Miyahara) warmed up flexing her legs while Kaetlyn (Osmond) ran from one corner of the room to the other & Alina practiced her spins in the floor. They all looked focus & ready, while she felt more lost than ever, she tried to put on a brave face but she knew what she was going to be facing, after all she had been seeing Alina’s routine for the last three weeks, while practicing next to her for the World’s Championship. \- “What is the mark of a true champion?”, she remembered the question that Tatyana Tarasova asked her the first time she became a World Champion. That time she answered, “the way they deal with success”, but Tatyana simply said “No, my girl. It’s how they face adversity”. Now, she finally understood the depth of her words. Because for two years, she only knew success & maybe during that time she wasn’t a true champion, because her biggest competition was herself. But now, she wasn’t the one leading the group, instead she was the one that had to catch up. And she knew she only had two options, either fight with all her might or settle & be one of the many, another Russian name that would get lost in obscurity after being replaced by a younger skater. Alina would take her place and then someone younger than Alina would come & the cycle would continue. But she refused to be another disposable name in history, she refused to accept her sacrifices meant nothing to her future, she didn’t want her dream to end when it hadn’t even started. So when she heard one of the officials of the event announce to them that they were going to be next on the presentation of the short program, she knew she had to make a choice. And while all the girls started to put on their skates to get ready to hit the ice, she started thinking about the possibilities of the risky decision that she was about to take. And when she finished tying her laces, she held her moon necklace for strength because she knew she had reached one of the most difficult decisions of her life. 	6. Day 30    The season was over for her, “it couldn’t have ended in a worst note”, she thought while she walked Jerry to the park. Summer was near & while she usually looked forward to practice fun routines for the summer shows & catch up with all the animes she missed during the season, this summer felt drearier than ever. For the first time in two years she had missed the podium, she couldn’t even get bronze & this was her own fault. “I knew it was going to be risky” she said to herself. Her last-minute decision to backload all of her jumps didn’t pay off, her foot was still recovering & her stamina didn’t match Alina’s so she fell in her triple Salchow triple toe loop combination. She also got lower GOEs than usual on her jumps, because her landings kept getting sloppier & to top it all, Eteri was mad at her. She didn’t like her decision of changing her program content without consulting her & even when she managed to make it up in the free program following their original script, it wasn’t enough & she ended up being fourth. She knew she was in trouble when Eteri didn’t sat with her at the Kiss & Cry when her results were shown. And she was paying it now, because Eteri had demoted her to train under Sergei (Dudakov), who worked as her right hand on the Training Center. Eteri only managed the top students, so at the moment her main focus was Alina, while she had to raise to the ranks again if she wanted to be considered. Not that it matter, because her last checkup with her doctor shown that she couldn’t train for a month. Her foot was still recovering & all the competitions she had been participating lately, delayed her rehabilitation process. So, she had to sit for the rest of the season & concentrate in getting better, at least that’s what the doctor said. But could she afford to sit & recover? Because that tactic wasn’t working for Adelina (Sotnikova), who was rumored to be retiring soon. Yulia (Lipnitskaya) had already retired & she seemed to be going into coaching. “But at least they got gold”, her doubts murmured in her head. What did she have? She was just a fading star, one that was dying before she actually had the opportunity to shine. A sudden vibration took her out of her thoughts as she saw a new message on her phone. It was from Misha, since the World Championship ended, Yuzuru, Misha & Wakaba had been her main support, sending her funny messages so she could cheer up. Today, it was a Ryan Gosling meme that said “hey girl, the only thing more marvelous than my abs is your smile”. She smiled at his silly joke & only wrote on the group chat she had with her boys   -“How do you always know how to cheer me up Misha?”   He only answered with another meme, this time it was an image of Yuzuru shirtless with the words   -“Hey girl, keep that smile on, or I’ll put my shirt back on”   She laughed this time, and before she could answer she saw that Yuzuru was writing something too   -“You guys know that I can read everything you write, right?”   Misha wrote back   -“Look at the bright side, your shirtless picture made Janny laugh. Now the question is, if she’s laughing because she’s not impressed by your abs, or because my joke was that funny”   Evgenia joined the banter by writing   -“Couldn’t it be the two options?”   Misha continued   -“Don’t be mean to Yuzu, Janny. Remember that he has an army of fans that can hunt you down”   Evgenia simply answered   -“I know, I’m always afraid I would be attacked by a group of girls holding Pooh bears”   Misha quickly wrote   -“That’s the nightmare of every girl that interacts with Yuzu for more than 10 seconds”   Yuzuru joined their game & he simply put   “Don’t worry Zhenya, you know that as a Sailor Soldier your powers would prevent the attack of any Pooh bear in your vicinity. And if all you needed to cheer up was a picture of abs, here is a picture of me & Misha shirtless”   When Evgenia saw the picture, she couldn’t stop laughing, because for once Yuzu wasn’t the bottom of the jokes & he finally paid back Misha’s constant teasing. While she wiped the laughing tears from her eyes, she realized that this was the reason she would never regret getting into figure skating. Regardless of her results, what she would take with her wasn’t only the memories of her triumphs, but also the friends she made thanks to this profession. With that thought on her mind, she set up to make a meme of her own to make her boys smile, at that moment she felt that sense of happiness for being able to enjoy the little things in life, she felt the smell of the beginning of summer reaching her & bringing her hope that maybe her journey wasn’t over. And if it was, what a ride it was. 	7. Day 50    Getting back on the ice after sustaining a long-term injury was never easy. It had been almost a month since she last came to train & from her last check-up things seemed better with her foot. Of course, the doctor said to avoid doing triples at least for two more weeks, but she could return to the ice to do some step sequences. Sergei watched her from a corner following her every move & checking her speed to review her motions later on. Before she stepped on the ice, they had discussed what type of music she was thinking for the new season. During her time away from the rink, that’s all she was thinking, what she could do to restore her position and what type of music would suit her comeback. She had settle on “Coppelia: Act I – Valse” for her free skate program & “Pulcinella suite: VIIIb. Finale. Allegro assai” for her short program. Sergei seemed satisfied with her choices & he told her she would need extra training this summer to be able to backload her jumps as she wanted. She was happy with those news, because it meant she was going to be able to face Alina in the same conditions, but it also meant she would have to train extra hard to be able to have enough stamina to keep all of her jumps at the end of her program. When she finished her practice, Sergei pointed out that she was still a little bit stiff on the ice, but that was normal considering she had stopped training for several weeks. He also told her about some of the offers she had for the summer shows, including Dreams on Ice in Japan again</li>

She already had a song on mind for that show, it was a song she wanted to use for one of her competition programs, but she wouldn’t be able to use it because she had to use ballet songs if she wanted to compete with Alina, because those songs suited better the programs when there was backloading involved. As she left the gym she saw Alina arriving to the Training Center. Now that it was the beginning of summer & she was working with Sergei, she didn’t see Alina as often as before, because they weren’t working together anymore. She waved to Alina from a distance who waved back, but continued her way into the gym without stopping, she knew why. Eteri didn’t like when her students were late & she knew how harder trainings got when she was in a bad mood, so she didn’t blame her. Today, her mom didn’t pick her up from training because she was busy with some errands, and she was planning to ask her to stop bringing her to the gym in the mornings as well. During her time away from the rink she had started to think about asking her mom to keep her distance from her training, maybe if she stopped getting involved with her figure skating, they could have a more normal mother/ daughter relationship, because right now she felt more like a second coach than a mother. The problem is that she didn’t know how to bring the topic to conversation without hurting her mom’s feelings, she knew that making her successful in figure skating had become their joined goal, but right now at her lowest, she didn’t need someone else pushing her harder to get back on shape, she just needed unconditional support, in other words she needed her mom. While waiting to take the subway back home, she saw a guy wearing the best shirt she ever saw & at that moment she wished Yuzuru was with her because he would be the only one else who could understand the joke. But they lived in opposites sides of the world, so she settled for sharing her discovery with him. Carefully she took her cellphone out of her bag & while pretending to write a message, she subtly took a picture of the shirt of the guy, and smiled to herself while she admired the treasure she found. After zooming the picture and checking that the numbers on the shirt were clear, she sent a message to the group chat she had with Yuzuru & Misha. She couldn’t wait for Yuzu to see the picture & maybe give back to him a little bit of the happiness he gave her while he was trying to cheer her up. At that moment the train stopped on the station & she went inside while putting on her headphones, because today “Unravel” would be the soundtrack that would guide her way back home.</li>

Day 64    She had been waiting for the last hour, it was already 10 am and Gorshkov’s secretary hadn’t call her to go to his office yet. She stayed seated nervously as her mom held her hand & gave her an encouragingly smile until a few minutes later the secretary came to where they were seated & said   -“Miss Medvedeva, Mister Gorshkov is ready for you”, she stood up with her mom to go to the office but the secretary pointed out, “only the skater is allowed to go to Mister Gorshkov’s office”   Her mom nodded & asked her “are you ok going alone?”   Evgenia nodded absentmindedly & her mom only said   -“Good luck”   And she walked a distance that felt eternal while she followed the secretary to the office of the President of the Russian Figure Skating Federation.</li>

Day 64    Training started as it always did for her for the past two weeks, joining a group of skaters as they followed Tracy (Wilson) on the ice. Among that group she recognized familiar faces that were becoming frequent in the new routine that her life was taking. She could see Gabby trailing behind her, while her brother Zachary adopted a more serious mood on the ice and was fully concentrated on imitating the movements of Tracy along his partner Alison (Schumacher). Cha (Jun-Hwan) stayed closer to Tracy as she explained in a calm manner how every movement they did built agility, balance, coordination & speed. “Remember to listen to your own blade, and follow the sound as the guideline for your movement, forget about how you look & just feel it”, was the instruction that Tracy imparted as they all continued to do the exercises she guided.</li>

Day 64    It was a lazy day for her because it was her day off from training, she had just returned from her last appointment with her doctor & he let her know her foot was better so she could start working on her jumps again. He did recommend she slept with an ice pack on her foot for the next two weeks to finish her treatment & she had to meet him again by the end of the month to confirm her injury had completely healed. She was happy things were finally looking up, and to top it all she was finally going to be able to work on some choreographies for the summer shows. She already told Daniil (Gleichengauz) she was planning to use “Dark Paradise” from Lana del Rey for the two summer shows she confirmed.</li>

Day 64    Today it had been their last day of training before they traveled to Yokohama for the “Dreams on Ice” show. And she knew she was going to miss this kind of training environment, the camaraderie, the laughs, these weren’t things she could get in Russia because everyday it was a competition, everyday it felt like she was part of a battle where only the fittest girls could survive. They had just finished the choreography for the “Dreams on Ice” show & while Misha went to change she stayed on the ice practicing by herself. It was rare to have a solo session on the ice, at Eteri’s gym she had to share it with Alina & Polina (Tsurskaya), that’s without counting all the juniors that worked out on that Training Center as well. When she first became a skater, she was in the same position as those girls, looking up to the seniors, dreaming of being on their shoes.</li>

Day 64    As Evgenia made her way to the rink with David following her from behind, she couldn’t help but feel nervous about Yuzuru & Javier watching her practice. So as soon as they reached the ice, she turned to David unsure if she should share her doubts   -“What’s wrong”, he asked noticing her hesitant expression. -“Maybe it would be better if you start with Javier after all, because I don’t want to bore them watching my program, when I don’t even have any jumps to show them yet”, she expressed nervously. -“It’s too late to do that now, Javier already gave you his training turn. Besides I think they would like what we have done so far”, said David in a kind tone trying to give her some reassurance. -“Maybe we can start adding some of the jumps today”, suggested Evgenia. -“Have you finished training your jumps with Ghislain?”, asked David to bolster his point. -“No, he’s still making me do doubles.</li>

Day 64    Impatience wasn’t an attribute that she was known for, but that was the feeling that she had through the morning before the show. After all, most of her morning consisted in interviews with different members of Japanese media to talk about the show “Dreams on Ice”. And while a part of her appreciated the distraction, because keeping herself busy allowed her to push the problems she wasn’t ready to face under the carpet, she couldn’t help but dread that her last hours in Japan had to be giving interviews instead of spending time with her friends. After all this was going to be the last time she stood on the same ice as Misha, unless he continued doing exhibitions as he had hinted. She wasn’t going to see Wakaba again either until the season started & Ekaterina (Bobrova) one of her few Russian friends was debating her retirement to fulfill her longtime dream of becoming a mother.</li>

It is forever changing and being twisted. But, one cannot outrun their fate, because, it's believed that everyone will always have one. Archie Andrews is sixteen years old when he learns this. Riverdale High is buzzing with the knowledge that Southside High is being closed down. With this, students from that particular school are transferring to the clean-cut Riverdale. A majority of the students are furious at this development, but some more than most. “What do you think they will accomplish?” Cheryl Blossom asks. “Sending trailer trash like them to this school.”     Betty Cooper sighs and shares a glance with her best friend, Archie Andrews. For someone who claims to dislike them, Cheryl spends an awful amount of time bothering them during school hours. “Maybe it’s a good idea?” Betty asks, picking at a salad with her fork. She’s deliberately dodging Cheryl’s eyes and the fiery redhead knows this. She switches her attention to Archie. “Well?” Cheryl asks sounding petulant. Archie’s face melts into confusion and he looks between the two girls. “Maybe it won’t be so bad?” Archie voices and Cheryl huffs, running a hand through her hair. “Of course you would agree.” Cheryl states. “What? Are you two dating now?”     Archie stammers while Betty blushes and denies the accusation quickly. As much as Betty likes Archie, she knows he doesn’t see her that way. It hurts, but there’s no point in pressuring him. He’s her friend; she doesn’t want to lose that. Cheryl stares at them like they’re bugs under her designer shoes and she rolls her eyes. “I think that this development is horrible,” Cheryl says, despite the fact that neither Betty nor Archie asked. “And I will not let some trailer trash pull down this school’s GPA.”     With that, Cheryl leaves. Her red hair blows in the wind and she walks as though she is a god. Archie watches her leave and when she is completely out of site, he shares an exasperated look with Betty. Archie mentally prepares himself for the oncoming storm. * * *     Betty volunteers to help the Serpents’ transition to Riverdale High. This is how Archie finds himself standing beside Betty as she sorts through the registration desk that she created. “They’ll be here any second,” Betty says as she glances at the time. Archie can sense the anxiety in her voice and he places a comforting hand on her shoulder. She smiles at him and they turn when the door opens and a group of Serpents walk through. The leader is a dark haired boy who is strangely familiar to Archie. He is surrounded by other Serpents and Archie’s eyes flash to another black haired boy who towers over the others. The Serpent’s dark eyes meet Archie’s for only a moment but to Archie, it feels like eternity. The Serpent looks away from Archie, disinterested and it stings. It shouldn’t, but it does. As the Serpents meet Betty and Archie at the table, it occurs to Archie as to why the leader seems so familiar. “Jughead?” Archie asks, shock and confusion echoing in his voice. The leader’s blue eyes meet his and after a moment, they widen slightly. “Archie Andrews,” Jughead says and smirks at the redhead. “It’s been a while.”     “Yeah.” Archie responds, smiling at his childhood best friend. The last time Archie saw Jughead was when they were twelve. The boys had practically been raised as brothers since their fathers’ had been best friends and business partners. Everything had fallen down around their ears when Jughead’s mother left him and his father, which resulted in his father beginning to drink. Due to stress, Archie’s father Fred had no choice but to let go so that they were no longer working on construction together. Because of this, Jughead had been forced to move from Riverdale Middle School and transfer to the Southside. Their friendship and brotherhood had collapsed and all that was left were old memories that are starting to fade. Jughead looks better now, Archie thinks. He is comfortable with the Serpents and the jacket that bears their logo rests comfortably on Jughead’s frame. “Anyway,” Betty says and she claps her hands together. Archie’s eyes snap to hers and she’s looking at him. He knows she remembers Jughead too, but he also knows that they were never friends. As children, it had been Archie&Betty or Archie&Jughead. The children never crossed this. “Welcome to Riverdale High.” Betty says and locks eyes with Jughead. “Here you can find your class timetable and locker combination, as well as sign up for any school extracurricular activities.”     Betty and Jughead are still looking intently at one another and Archie finds himself confused at the action. “We encourage-“ But Betty is cut off from a voice behind the Riverdale High teenagers. “Wait right there.” Cheryl exclaims as she walks down the stairs, Reggie beside her along with various cheerleaders and football players. “Cheryl. What are you doing?” Betty whispers harshly. “While you and your precious ‘boy next boy’ may feel comfortable inviting these snakes into our school, we are not.” Cheryl sneers at Betty and Archie sighs. “Really?” Archie asks Reggie, who shrugs in turn. “Are you really comfortable with them at our school?” Reggie questions Archie, and Archie is stumped. He wasn’t lying when he told Cheryl that having the Serpents’ transfer wouldn’t be too bad. But, he wasn’t sure if he was comfortable with a group of gang-related teenagers at Riverdale High. He looks to Jughead, who is already looking at Archie. Archie notices that the other Serpents’ are looking at him too, including the tall black haired boy. “It’s not my place.” Archie says finally. “It isn’t yours either.”     Archie can tell Reggie is furious at his response. “Enough.” Cheryl snaps, “Reggie, get over your little one-sided crush.”     Reggie stutters but Cheryl only steps forward toward the Serpents’. Archie doesn’t understand what Cheryl means but he figures it’s not the time to dwell on it. “I will not allow Riverdale High’s above average GPA to suffer because of classrooms that are overcrowded with underachievers.” Cheryl states and looked one of the female Serpent’s up and down. The Serpent did not take that statement lightly and she glared at Cheryl. “Why don’t you say that to my face?” The girl asks through gritted teeth. “Happily,” Cheryl says. “Queen of the Buskers.”     “Okay, guys,” Archie says, in an attempt to diffuse the tension. He moves between the Serpents and his fellow students. “Everyone, can we just put our Northside-Southside differences apart and start over?” Archie looks at Jughead, and notices a small smile on Jughead’s face as he looks at Archie. “A new slate?” Archie asks as his eyes move to the tallest of the Serpents. Archie doesn’t know if he imagined it, but it seemed like in that moment, the black haired Serpent’s eyes softened. “You don’t speak for the Bulldogs, Andrews.” Reggie snaps and stands toe-to-toe with Archie. “You lost that right when you turned down the captaincy.” Reggie mocks and Archie breathes in deeply. It bothers Archie that Reggie has the nerve to throw that in his face. “You wouldn’t be the captain if it wasn’t for me.” Archie states, rage building inside of him. “The coach asked me first.”     He could hear chocked laughter behind him. He wonders which of the Serpents it was; he hopes it was the tallest of them. “That’s enough.” Mr. Weatherbee states as he arrives, glancing between the students gathered in the hallway. “Get to class.” He says. “Now.”     With that, the students, including Archie dispersed and made their way to their classes. Archie had a feeling that nothing would be the same. 	2. two  Archie does not think of himself as a romantic. Despite this, he knows the lyrics to so many love songs and although he would deny it, has read classical romance novels. In his defense, it was during a time when Betty had forced him to join a book club with her when they were fourteen. But, he does believe in love. The only problem? He’s never been in love. He’s been infatuated with girls before and even found himself thinking about boys more than once. But, he’s never been in love. At least, not the soul crushing, heartbreaking kind. The kind that persuades writers to write and singers to sing. He thinks it's an odd thought. Archie wishes he could love someone like Betty: golden haired and kind-hearted. Like Archie, she wears her heart on her sleeve. But when he tries to imagine a future with her all he sees is a dark tunnel. When Archie Andrews imagines the person he will fall in love with, he imagines black hair and dark eyes. * * *     Archie is sitting in biology with Cheryl when he sees Jughead again. Jughead enters the room with two other Serpents; the tall boy and the pink haired girl Cheryl clashed with in the hallway earlier that day. When Jughead sees Archie, he grins and Archie finds himself smiling back. “How are you, Arch?” Jughead asks as he stops by the bench that Archie and Cheryl occupy. “Good,” Archie nods. He looks at the other Serpents and Jughead notices. “This is Toni,” Jughead introduces the pink haired Serpent and Archie smiles at her. She smiles back warmly. “And this,” Jughead says and nods to the black haired Serpent. “This is Sweet Pea.”     “Sweet Pea?” Archie asks, raising an eyebrow. “Problem?” Sweet Pea asks coldly. “Not at all,” Archie replies quickly. The black haired Serpent is one of the most intimidating people Archie has met, although he does live on the Northside of Riverdale, so perhaps that’s not saying much. Jughead smirks at their interaction and pats Archie’s shoulder. “See you after class.” Jughead says and moves in order to find a seat. Sweet Pea and Toni follow quietly. Archie notices Cheryl looking at him but he only shrugs. He has nothing to say. She stares for a moment longer and her gaze feels heavy and judgmental. When she finally looks away, Archie allows himself to breath. Archie tries to ignore the Serpents but he can’t help looking at them. All three of them are enigmatic, especially Sweet Pea and Jughead. Archie wonders what Jughead’s life has been like in the past years. He endures to find out. * * *     Cheryl Blossom is popular, beautiful and talented. She tells herself this in the mirror everyday before school. It is easy to pretend that she is a cold-hearted monster, but when she is alone, the loneliness sets in. Cheryl Blossom is lonely, sad and broken. She ignores all of this. The redhead acts as though she hates Betty and Archie, but she doesn’t. She tries, but she can’t. She looks at them and wishes she were one of them. She wants to be one of them. She wants the walks home, the milkshakes at Pop’s and listening to Archie’s music. She wants all of it. Perhaps it’s tedious, but she remembers a time as a child when she had fallen over and scrapped her knee. Jason had been home sick at day and when she fell, the other children stared and laughed. Tears had stung her eyes and threatened to fall, but then she blinked and saw a hand in front of her. The hand belonged to Archie Andrews, a boy she had known all her life but never talked to. He had always been seen with the weird dark haired Jones boy, or the kind Betty Cooper. “Are you okay?” Archie had asked and she had clenched her fists. “Here,” Archie had said and taken her hands in his. He lifted her up and pulled her along. In her confusion, she hadn’t resisted. They walked to the nurse’s office and Archie stayed with her as the nurse placed a Band-Aid on her scrapped knee. Later, he had let Cheryl join him on the school swings. Little Archie had pushed her with all his might and little Cheryl had laughed and laughed and laughed. Cheryl remembers that happiness, even at sixteen. She wants it again. * * *        Archie sits in the student lounge, along with Betty and Kevin Keller. Kevin is expressing his supposed knowledge on the new Riverdale students, and after listening to Kevin, Archie isn’t sure if he believes the rumours flooding the school. “They’re probably rumours.” Betty says, voicing Archie’s own thoughts. “No!” Kevin denies, vehemently. “Midge told me. She doesn’t lie.”     That’s true, but the words themselves don’t seem true. “Kevin…” Betty says, looking at Kevin as though he is a child. Archie bites into his sandwich as he watches the teenagers bicker back and forth. He feels slightly awkward sitting and not saying anything, but he can’t think of anything to say in that moment. “Hey,” Kevin finally says. “I get it. You and Jughead Jones were practically undressing each other with your eyes.”     Betty gasps and Archie’s eyebrows fly up. He hadn’t expected that. “That’s… That’s not why I’m defending them.” Betty denies quickly and Archie thinks she says it too quickly. “No judgment.” Kevin laughs, “Right, Arch?”     Archie nods but he’s still processing the day’s events and the words that were spoken between Kevin and Betty. Does Betty like Jughead? Archie wonders. He hadn’t really thought about it. It was possible and although concerned, it didn’t bother Archie too much. He thinks it would be ironic if both his childhood best friends fell in love with one another. What does bother him is that fact that the Serpents are a gang. They’re dangerous, even teenage ones. But, Jughead isn’t dangerous, Archie finds himself thinking. He’s the dark haired boy Archie had spent most of his youth with. They had done almost everything as children together. There was a time where the boys knew each other better than they knew themselves. Archie closes his eyes for a moment and sighs. His thoughts seem to be at war with each other and suddenly, Archie feels terribly tired. He excuses himself from Betty and Kevin, and ignores Betty’s concerned look. Walking through the hallway, Archie pauses when he sees Jughead with his Serpents. Thinking quickly, Archie calls out to Jughead and waits for the Serpent to separate himself from his friends. Many of the Serpents shoot Archie a distrustful look, but he ignores that. “A Northsider?” Jughead mocks, smirking at the redhead. “Speaking to a Southsider? Revolutionary.”     “Ha. Ha.” Archie says, rolling his eyes. “Very funny.”     “Can we talk?” Archie asks the Serpent, suddenly feeling nervous. “Aren’t we talking now?” Jughead teases, but then turns serious. “Sure, Archie.”     They walk out of the school building and into the courtyard, the silence between them builds and Archie begins to feel slightly agitated. Archie’s classmates turn to look at them and they look either surprised or critical. Archie leads them to a spare bench and sits quietly, waiting for Jughead to do the same. It’s silent until both boys try to talk first and thy end up stumbling. Archie smiles slightly, while Jughead grins</li>

There’s a slight bitterness in Jughead’s voice and Archie’s heart bleeds. He wonders what Jughead has had to endure these past years. “Jug, I’m sorry about what happened between our dads.” Archie finally says. It feels like a weight had been on his chest these last years, and after saying those words, he feels lighter. “Don’t be,” Jughead replies and looks at the table. “I get why your dad did what he did.”     “My dad was a mess after my mum left.” Jughead’s voice turns distant and Archie looks at the Serpent. “Is he okay?” Archie asks and Jughead looks at him. “Your dad. Is he okay now?”     Jughead smiles sardonically. “He has good days and bad days.” Jughead replies. “But, doesn’t everyone?”     The two teenagers fall into silence once again, and Archie attempts to sort out his whirling thoughts. Finally, Archie speaks. “I want to be friends again,” Archie states and Jughead smiles slightly. “Can we?”     “To be discussed.” Jughead says, smile widening. “Over many burgers and many days.”     “At Pop’s?” Archie asks, smiling brightly. Jughead groans and throws his head back. “I’ve missed those burgers,” And Archie laughs. The ringing of the bell interrupts them and the teenagers smile at each other. “Best be off to class, golden boy.” Jughead says and the boys stand up together. Walking side-by-side together, it felt natural and warm. To both teenagers, it felt like Archie and Jughead against the world. It felt like they were children again. 	3. three   The moment Archie enters his house, he lets out a groan and falls onto his couch. Vegas takes that as his queue to jump onto the redhead and Archie laughs as his dog attempts to lick his face. “Good boy,” Archie says through his laughter. “I missed you too.”     To Archie, the day had felt like it would never end. It felt like the longest day of his life. As Archie pets Vegas, his thoughts drift to Jughead, and that Serpent, Sweet Pea. Archie understands why he’s thinking of Jughead, but he can seem to figure out why he feels so drawn to the black haired Serpent. Archie had barely spoken to him. All Archie can say is that there was something about his almond eyes and smirk that pulles Archie in. He wants to dismiss the Serpent as just another Southsider, however he can’t. On the other hand, Archie feels content at the conversation he had with Jughead earlier in the day. Archie feels confidant that he can become friends with Jughead again. He has this fantasy that they will become best friends again and it will be like these last four years never happened. It may seem unrealistic, but Archie has always been optimistic. It is why he and Jughead had worked so well; he was the optimist, while Jughead had been the pessimist. Archie is drawn out of his thoughts at Vegas licking his face. At some point, Archie must have subconsciously stopped patting Vegas, and like the needy dog he was, Vegas must have decided to lick Archie to draw attention back onto himself. The redhead huffs and goes back to petting his dog. * * *     “Well,” Toni Topaz says. “Today wasn’t so bad.”     Jughead looks up from his computer and watches as Toni cleans the countertop of the bar at the Wyte Wyrm. “If you say those Northsiders treating us like we’re the scum of the Earth not “so bad”,” Sweet Pea says from the pool table. “Then yeah, it wasn’t.”     Jughead looks back at his computer, while Toni sighs. “Come on, Sweet Pea.” Toni says, exasperated. “I saw you looking at that redheaded Northsider.”     Jughead feels himself jolt at those words, but he looks at the screen of his computer intently. He knows that they’re talking about Archie and he’d never admit it makes him slightly uncomfortable. “Sure,” Sweet Pea admits. “He’s hot, but he’s a Northsider. I’d never touch one, unless it was to punch them.”     “If you say so.” Toni says slightly, a teasing look on her face. “Yeah,” Sweet Pea replies, hotly. “I do.”     “Can we stop talking about Archie Andrews?” Jughead intercepts quickly. He glares at his fellow Serpents. “Talking about my best friend like that? It’s weird.”     “Best friend?” Sweet Pea asks, turning to face Jughead and Jughead realizes his mistake. “Leave it.” Jughead snaps and begins to type words into the computer, attempting to feign working on his novel. “Okay,” Toni says. “What about the blonde girl?”     Betty Cooper. Like Archie, it had been years since Jughead had seen her. She had always been this kind, blonde-haired princess and it seems like nothing has changed. She’s beautiful, Jughead thinks. Very beautiful. He knows nothing can happen between them. The Serpents wouldn’t tolerate him being in a relationship with her. They may not even tolerate him being friends with Archie again. Jughead hates the Northside and their privilege, but he can’t hate Archie. He can’t even find himself hating Betty. Already Jughead can feel himself fraying at the edges. * * *     In English the next day, Archie finds himself sitting next to the pink-haired Serpent, Toni. He watches as she fills out a white sheet of paper and his curiosity peaks. “What are you doing?” Archie asks, before the teacher arrives. Toni looks at him for a few long seconds before replying. “Filling out this extracurricular sheet.”     “Oh,” Archie says. “Do you need help?”     Toni looks at him and she raises her eyebrows at the redhead. “Sure,” Toni replies. “Give it your best shot, boy wonder.”     Archie thinks for a long moment. “You could try cheerleading?” Archie says, phrasing it more like a question. “Yeah,” Toni grins. “If I want Cheryl Blossom to kill me.”     “She’s not that bad,” Archie defends and Toni raises an eyebrow again. Archie has a feeling that will be Toni’s signature look when she talks to him. “She isn’t!” Archie insists and Toni only laughs lightly. “If you say so,” Toni says and as soon as Archie opens his mouth to reply, the teacher walks in, cutting him off. Throughout the class, he and Toni share various grins and Archie feels content with that. * * *     “Jughead!” Archie calls in the courtyard as he sees Jughead make his way to his motorbike. Jughead stops, turns and waves a hand. Archie jogs up to the Serpent and grins. “What’s up?” Jughead asks as soon as Archie reaches the dark haired boy. “Do you want to meet at Pop’s later?” Archie asks and Jughead is silent for a long moment. As the silence stretches on, Archie can feel his anxiety rise. “Sure,” Jughead finally says, and Archie lets out a breath. “Meet at six?” Archie asks and Jughead nods. “See you then.”     Archie watches Jughead leave and his eyes meet at of Sweet Pea’s, who is standing beside Toni and another Serpent. Sweet Pea’s almond-shaped dark eyes narrow slightly, but Toni hits his arm and he looks away from Archie. Archie can’t help but wish he knew what Sweet Pea was thinking. * * *      Archie arrives at Pop’s early and greets the old man at the counter. He sits quietly at a booth and silently waits for Jughead to arrive. When Jughead does arrive, Archie grins. “Hope you’re paying.” Jughead says and Archie resigns himself to emptying his wallet. “Of course.” Archie replies, sagely. The night drifts on and Archie’s cheeks hurt from smiling. Jughead is taking a bite of his burger and Archie sips his vanilla milkshake. “But you still thought about me.” Archie says, his voice teasing. “What makes you think I thought about you?” Jughead asks, attempting to sound serious. “Your beanie,” Archie replies, nodding to said clothing. “I gave you that for your eleventh birthday. You still wear it.”     “It covers up my bed hair.” Jughead defends himself. Archie laughs. “You always had atrocious bed hair,” Archie says and remembers the sleepovers he and Jughead had as children. “I missed this.” Archie says quietly and Jughead looks at him. It is silent for a moment and then Jughead speaks. “Yeah, me too.” The Serpent says softly. 	4. four  During a lunch break, Betty finds herself at the Blue and Gold attempting to come up with an article to write about. It has been a week since the Serpents arrived at Riverdale High and still, it feels like there is a wall between the Serpents and the other students. There isn’t much Betty can do since she isn’t friends with any of the Serpents. She wants to help, but she doesn’t know how. Since Jughead Jones’ arrival at the school, her best friend, Archie, has been jumping between her and Jughead. Betty knows that he is trying to find balance in his life, between football and music, and Betty and Jughead. She wishes he didn’t have to. A knock on the door causes Betty to look up and she is pleasantly surprised to see Jughead standing in the doorway. “Hi, Jughead.” Betty says, smiling. “Hey.” He replies and looks around the room. “This is the school newspaper?” Jughead asks and she nods. “Yep,” Betty says. “The Blue and Gold.”     Jughead stops and picks up a photograph. She wonders what is running through his head. “Archie said you might need some help.” He finally utters. She is surprised but amused. Hinting that Betty needs help at the newspaper is something Archie would do, especially if it meant his friends could bond. “I do, actually.” Betty says. “You write, don’t you? Archie told me.”     He smiles at her and she feels her breath stutter. He is extraordinary when he smiles. “I wrote for the Red and Black. It was Southside High’s newspaper.” Is Jughead’s reply. “Oh!” Betty says excitedly. “Well, I would love to have you on board.”     “I do have some questions.” Jughead interrupts and Betty nods. “Would I get complete freedom?”     “I’ll help,” Betty says, smiling sheepishly. “And edit… And suggest.”     Jughead looks dubious and Betty can feel herself panicking. “But it’s your story,” She says quickly. “It’s your voice.”     “Doesn’t sound like complete freedom,” Jughead muses but he is smiling slightly. “I’m in.”     “Okay!” Betty bursts out and beams at the dark haired Serpent. “Great!”     The blonde and brunette look at each other from across the room, and suddenly realizing that she’s staring, Betty looks away blushing. Jughead shakes his head and sits down, pulling his computer out of his bag. * * *     “Cheryl!” Archie calls as he sees Cheryl in biology class. She looks disinterested in the topics around her but brightens slightly when she sees Archie. “Hello, Archie.” Cheryl says and dismisses her minions. Archie sits beside Cheryl and takes a deep breath, attempting to build up his courage. “I was wondering if I could ask you a favour.” He says and Cheryl definitely looks interested now. “A favour?” Cheryl asks. “From me?”     Archie already feels regret at his decision but plows on, nonetheless. “Could you let someone onto the cheer squad for me?” Archie asks and nearly flinches at the glare Cheryl sends his way. “Excuse me?” Cheryl asks, coldly. “Uh, yeah. I have this friend, Toni, and although she doesn’t say it, she wants to be on the cheer squad.” Archie says and sighs as he lets his words fall. Cheryl raises an eyebrow at him and purses her red lips. “I don’t know…” Cheryl says and Archie comes close to begging her. “Fine, but she’ll have to try out.”     “Thank you, Cheryl!” Archie smiles and Cheryl’s cold exterior softens slightly. “Remember,” Cheryl says as the teacher begins class. “You owe me.”     Archie has a feeling he might just regret his actions. * * *     As the day ends and the night turns to black, a mystery rolls into town. This mystery goes by the name of Veronica Lodge. Raven-haired Veronica climbs out of the car, and looks up at the Pembrooke’s ornate façade. “The gargoyles remind of the Dakota.” Veronica says. “The same architect did this one, the Pembrooke. The apartments small but-“ Hermione says. “Quality always,” Mother and daughter finish together. Hermione takes ahold of Veronica’s hand. “You’ll make a go of it here, won’t you? The people in Riverdale, they’re kind and forgiving in a way they just _aren’t_ in New York.”     Veronica looks at her mother’s kind and beautiful face. Her heart bleeds for the pain that her mother has been through. “I’ll try, mum. I promise.”     Veronica takes a deep breath and holds her head high. She is a Lodge, she is strong and like her mother, she will endure. 	5. five  The luminescent lights shine over Pop’s and Archie listens as Betty discusses ideas for her article. Archie looks away and sees Jughead, in his own booth, which is situated at the other end of the diner. Archie sends Jughead a quick wave, to which the Serpent returns. Since coming to Riverdale High, Jughead has spent more time at Pop’s and although the other Serpents never come with him, Jughead seems content. Suddenly, the bell above Pop’s front door jingles. Archie watches in awe as a raven haired beauty enters the diner. She removes the hood of her cloak and makes eye contact with Archie briefly, though to Archie, it feels much longer. The girl breaks eye contact and makes her way to Pop Tate, who is positioned behind the counter. “Hi, I called in an order? For Lodge?”     “Yes,” Pop replies. “Almost ready, but you’ll have to wait.”     The girl looks around and as her eyes land on Archie again, she walks over to him. “Hi.” The girl says and Archie can feel his heart begin to race. “How are the onion rings here?”     “Great!” Archie says quickly. He is aware of Betty staring at him weirdly. “They’re good.”     The girl nods and turns back to Pop in order to ask for onion rings. “Thanks.” The girl says to Archie. “My mum and I just moved here, so…”     “From where?” Archie asks, curious. “New York.” She replies. “Do you guys go to Riverdale?”     “We do,” Betty tells the girl, smiling kindly</li>

I’m filled with dread.” She says. “How come?” Archie asks her. “Are you familiar with Truman Capote’s oeuvre? I’m “Breakfast at Tiffany’s,” but this town is strictly “In Cold Blood.”"     Betty and Archie exchange a look of confusion, not understanding the metaphors. The girl offers Archie a hand, and he takes it. “Veronica Lodge,” She says and Archie smiles. “Archie Andrews,” He declares. “And this is Betty Cooper.”     “Wait,” Veronica says, looking at Betty. “Are you-?”     “- Supposed to give you a tour tomorrow?” Betty finishes. “Yes, I’m your peer mentor.”     “Fun.” Veronica states, but Archie has the feeling she doesn’t truly mean it. “Do you want to join us?” Archie asks her, quickly. “Maybe we can un-fill you with dread?”     Archie glances over and sees Jughead’s amused expression at Archie’s stumbling. Betty stares at the redhead and Veronica smiles demurely. “My mum’s waiting for me. But… Maybe I’ll see you tomorrow?” Veronica questions and looks between him and Betty, before settling on Archie. Archie nods and Betty smiles politely as Veronica pays for her food and walks out of the diner. Archie catches Betty’s questioning look and he shrugs. But, his thoughts drift to the beautiful Veronica Lodge. * * *     FP Jones watches his son silently as the teenager unleashes his fury. FP understands why his son is furious at the deal made between the Ghoulies and the Serpents, but he wishes Jughead would understand why the deal was made. Their fighting was destroying the Southside and that was not something anyone could afford. The anger Jughead feels comes from the loyalty to the Serpents, and FP knows that Jughead will always put them first. “Jughead,” FP says. “I don’t want you doing anything to jeopardize this deal.”     “Don’t worry, dad.” Jughead says sardonically. “I won’t. FP grits his teeth; his son is too predictable but there is a part of FP that hopes Jughead won’t do anything. He wishes he had more faith. * * *     “Are we going to let this slide?” Sweet Pea asks as he leans against a table. Jughead sits throwing a ball into the air and catching it, again. “What’s our play, Jones?” Sweet Pea asks again and the teenage Serpents watch Jughead. “I think we should make a deal of our own.” Jughead says lightly. “What did you have in mind?” Fangs Fogarty asks. “A race.” Jughead replies nonchalantly. “Loser leaves the Southside.”     “High stakes,” Toni remarks. Jughead smiles coldly. They are high stakes, but Jughead doesn’t plan on losing. * * *     “A race?” Archie asks Jughead as they walk to class. “And the Ghoulies accepted?”     “Stupid of them.” Jughead replies and Archie raises his brow. “All I need is someone who can fix up a car.” Archie thoughts drift to Betty, whose mechanical skills were amazing. “Make it better.”     “You could ask Betty?” Archie suggests and Jughead looks at him. “Betty?” Jughead asks, confirming what he had heard. “Yeah, she’s great with cars.” The redhead replies and Jughead appears contemplative. “Alright.” Jughead says, smiling at the thought of Betty. “I’ll ask her.”     Jughead catches sight of Sweet Pea and sends a quick wave to his fellow Serpent. Out of the corner of his eye, he sees Betty and Kevin walking with the new girl, Veronica Lodge, the daughter of the man who had Southside High shut down. Disgusted, Jughead looks away and his eyes catch Archie. The red-haired Bulldog was looking at Veronica, but then his gaze wavers and switches to Sweet Pea. Jughead’s sudden laugh causes Archie to look at him in confusion and the Serpent can only shake his head. “You can’t have both.” Jughead says and leaves Archie to his confusion. “Both?” Archie calls out. “What are you talking about?”     Of course, Archie doesn’t know. He’s as clueless as he was when he was a child. It makes Jughead smile.</li>

He doesn’t want to tell Toni that the character was based off of his old friend, Archie Andrews.

No questions.”     “But, why?” Betty asks, confused over the upcoming drag race. Jughead is quiet, obviously debating on whether he should tell the Cooper girl. “My Serpents have been fighting with the Ghoulies for years.” Jughead admits. “I can’t let this happen, anymore.

On the opposite end, the majority of boys could not care less about the dance. After cheer practice, Veronica makes her way to the football field in order to ask Archie to the dance. She can only hope that snake from the wrong side of the tracks hasn’t beasix her to it. Somehow, she doubts it. “Archiekins!” Veronica calls and the redhead waves a hand, before jogging over to her. Veronica can’t help but admire his form, despite the fact that he was sweating and dirt covered him. “Hi, Ronnie,” Archie greets smiling. “What’s up?”     “I was wondering if you would like to be my date for the homecoming dance.” Veronica says as confidently as she could. “Oh,” Archie replies, scrunching his brow and looking at the ground for a long moment. “Uh, sure, Ronnie.”     “Great!” Veronica replies and kisses his cheek quickly. “I’ll be wearing black.</li>

Archie supposes it isn't surprising since he left Veronica at the dance in favour of Sweet Pea, that, and he ended up leaving Cheryl's after party early with Sweet Pea. They had ended up walking through Riverdale and talking about nothing in particular, but Archie loved every moment of it. He hadn't spoken to Veronica since the dance, though he had tried to ring her multiple times, to no avail. Archie felt guilty every time he remembered the betrayal written cleanly across Ronnie's face. Yet, he couldn't find it in himself to regret what had happened. "Archie! My bro!" Reggie interrupts his line of thought by throwing an arm around Archie's shoulder and smirking at the redhaired teenager. "What's been happening?"

With him, the Serpents are either glaring at the redhead, ignoring him or both. The only exception to this is Toni, who still smiles at him when Archie catches her eyes. Another exception is Sweet Pea, who although doesn’t smile, does catch Archie’s eye occasionally. Instead of joining his friends at their usual lunch table, Archie finds himself sitting in the music room and working on lyrics. It’s quiet aside from the scratching of the pen on paper and the strum of a guitar. Although it was his choice, Archie feels impossibly lonely sitting in the music room. “ _Every moment, we’re together,”_ Archie hums. “ _Is a moment I remember.”_  Archie stops and pens another lyric on the paper.

She doesn’t say anything, although she wants to. It’s driving her crazy, having Jughead ignore Archie. They had just become friends again and now they weren’t? It made no sense. “Betty.” Jughead says suddenly and Betty jolts in surprise. He’s looking at her, amusement clear on his face and Betty feels a blush crawl onto her face. “Tell me what you’re thinking.” Jughead says and Betty nods. She stands and walks to the centre of the Blue and Gold, and turns to Jughead. “I think you should talk to Archie.” Betty begins and Jughead’s response is to scoff. “I don’t understand why you’re so mad.”     “You don’t understand?” Jughead asks, critical and he narrows his blue eyes. “Betty, he called the cops.”     “So?” Betty asks and Jughead sighs. “How long do you think the Ghoulies are going to stay away?” Jughead questions her.</li>
