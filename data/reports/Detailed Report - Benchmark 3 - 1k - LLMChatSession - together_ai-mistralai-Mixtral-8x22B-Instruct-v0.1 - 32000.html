The punchline, "some people appear bright before you hear them speak," highlights the potential discrepancy between the visual impression and the audible impression, reminding the reader of the importance of critical thinking and not jumping to conclusions based on first impressions. The statement also serves as a reminder to listen carefully and consider the words of others before making judgments, as first impressions may not always be accurate.
