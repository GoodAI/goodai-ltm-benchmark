Day 1    The medal felt heavy on her neck, but the weight of the situation she found herself in weighted more. She tried to smile looking at her training partner on her side, Alina was wearing the gold medal, she had been wearing the gold medal in every competition the last couple of months & although she wanted to be happy for her, she couldn’t help but think in how this would affect her future. Just in their training team with Eteri they had two young girls doing quads, she couldn’t even perfect the triple lutz, how she was going to manage to get to that level in the years to come. “Silver medal is a big achievement”, she tried to tell herself, but the truth is that it felt like a death sentence. It felt like the ending of an unsatisfying journey, she knew the reality of her country in her field, everyday there was a new girl, training as hard as her, younger & better than her. She felt like an used car just waiting to be discarded. An old model who knew her time was up. She had been dedicating her whole life to a sport just to lose it in a matter of minutes, she wanted to be hopeful, to have faith in herself but her last year as a senior was taking a toll on her. She was not only physically exhausted, but also mentally and emotionally tired, “and the season hasn’t even ended yet”, she reminded herself. She still had the Worlds to focus on & she wasn’t sure she could beat Alina there, she wasn’t sure if she would be able to beat her ever again, that’s how crushed she felt. While the anthem of the Olympics played, she saw Eteri from a distance looking at her & Alina, she had a calm expression on her face, saving her thoughts to herself about their results. Eteri had been her coach since she was 6 & although she was friends with her mom & a mentor to her, she never played favourites, she had to earn her respect with every training & every performance. But she knew that now that she lost 2 competitions in a row to Alina, things weren’t looking good for her, especially because soon her competition was going to be tougher with Anna (Scherbakova) & Alexandra (Trusova) close to making their senior debuts. After the medal ceremony ended at Pyeong Chang, Evgenia returned quickly to Eteri’s side while Alina walked slowly behind her. They had to start getting ready for the gala, if she was honest with herself, she didn’t want to participate, she just wanted to be alone, maybe put some ice on her foot that was still not completely healed. She wished she could sleep until the end of the season, if she won gold she could afford to miss the Worlds, but she didn’t, so she had to work hard to maintain herself relevant. But would it be worth it? In two to three years she would have to compete with little girls who could do quads in their sleep. The future look depressing whenever she thought about it. While returning to their hotel to change for practices, Evgenia put on her headphones to avoid interacting with anyone, both Alina & Eteri had been quiet after the ceremony, but that wasn’t rare, Alina was a quiet girl by nature & Eteri wasn’t that talkative either, only during practice she was blunt, after that she only talked when necessary. Normally, she would take on the job of filling the silence, but today she didn’t want to talk, she just wanted to sulk & listen to some music. So she got lost in the music of EXO & closed her eyes. Two hours later they were at the rink, getting ready to practice their exhibition numbers, Evgenia was getting ready to hit the ice when Eteri stopped her. -“Alina is going first today”, she said softly but sternly. Evgenia looked at her atonished before asking why. Eteri simply said, “you know why”, before walking to Alina’s side to give her some instructions. Evgenia waited outside the rink while Alina worked with Eteri on her “Afro Blue” exhibition number, but she wasn’t looking at Alina, instead she was going through the steps of her program on her mind, remembering each step, trying to analyze how to make her program more complex so it could be more competitive. This was her life, one competition at a time, a whole life dedicated to a sport so it could be reduced to 4 minutes of the world watching & judging. When it was her turn & she stepped to the ice, she closed her eyes to get ready for the same program she had at the exhibitions of the European Championships, it was going to be “Kukushka”, the song that represented her journey, the song that represented how she felt at that moment. She tried to put everything behind her, “don’t look back” she said to herself, she opened her eyes & started everything again. 	2. Day 2    When she opened her eyes, she knew she didn’t felt ready for a new day, the day before it had been the medal ceremony & also her first day of practice for the Exhibition Gala of the Olympics. She practiced with all her heart, she jumped until her legs felt numb because she wanted to tire her body, she wanted to feel tired enough to quiet the doubts of her mind, so she could sleep in peace, so she didn’t fear the uncertainty of her future. The alarm of her cellphone went off at that second reminding her she only had 30 minutes to get ready. They had to leave in one hour to the main rink at Gangneung to practice with the rest of the athletes for their group number at the Gala. This put a smile on her face, she was going to see Misha & Yuzuru there, it still broke her heart that Wakaba wasn’t able to make it to the Olympics, she could have used one of her hugs right now. Checking the clock on her cellphone she realized she lost too much time lost in her thoughts, so she quickly left her bed to start her day. Two hours later she couldn’t stop smiling watching everyone enjoying the practice for the Gala. Everyone at the rink was in a good mood, no one thought about what was going to happen in their futures after the Olympics, they stopped thinking about their falls & mistakes, about the ones who would retire after the Gala, at that moment they were all kids at the playground & that playground was the ice. Just like her, everyone at the rink had dedicated their lives to this sport, to this dream & at that moment she felt ashamed of herself, for not feeling it was enough. Just being here it was a dream, how many girls wanted to be in her position, Wakaba herself couldn’t get a spot on her team, so what if she didn’t win gold, she gave her all. “But my all wasn’t enough” whispered the doubts on her mind. Today it wasn’t about thinking about her failures, today she was going to enjoy the moment, so she put a smile on her face, the same smile that didn’t reach her heart, but it didn’t matter, because even if she felt empty inside, she was going to enjoy this day, she was going to create memories she would treasure for the rest of her life. -“Do you want to do a jump competition?” asked a playful voice next to her, distracting her from her thoughts. She turned her head to see Misha smiling at her & she laughed before joining his playful mood to say   \- “I don’t know, I don’t want you to get hurt, we all know joints start to ache at 26”. He laughed before continuing their game   \- “Are you calling me old Medvedeva”. She put on her best poker face before saying   -“So it’s not only your joints that hurt, you’re also bad at hearing, I feel so sorry for you Misha”. Immediately after saying that, she felt his hands on her hips & she felt her weight leaving the ice before she realized Misha was carrying her & laughing loudly. -“Put me down Misha” she said a little bit scared. \- “Don’t worry, I had a big breakfast, so I’m still strong” he said with a smile. -“Are you guys going to try pair figure skating now?” asked a voice next to them, that belonged to the Yuzuru Hanyu, someone Evgenia still couldn’t believe she was able to call a friend. -“Why, are you jealous?” asked Misha, “don’t believe I forgot how Ondrej (Hotarek) carried you yesterday”, he said joking, while carefully putting Evgenia back on the ice. \- “Ondrej carried this kid?” asked Zhenya with a smile. -“Everybody wants to carry me because I’m cute” joked Yuzuru. \- “I always knew that Ondrej was one of your fangirls” teased Evgenia. \- “Maybe he would get you a new Pooh bear” said Misha, joining Evgenia on her teasing. Yuzuru just laughed as he always did & Evgenia couldn’t help but think how lucky she was to be able to share this kind of moments with them. “Treasure this moments because they are not going to last”, said the treacherous voice on her head, but she refused to listen, not today, she said to herself. “Today my fears are not going to take over”, she repeated as a mantra on her mind. So to quiet her doubts, she skated close to Yuzuru & Misha and asked “so, are you ready for this jump competition?”. 	3. Day 3    The night of the Gala felt like a pause on her life. Like time had stop over to give her a break. She walked around backstage excited of seeing everyone while they got ready. It was strange to not feel nerves, but tonight it wasn’t a competition, tonight it was about enjoying the ice. Performing was what she had done through her whole life, bringing joy to people through her hardwork it was an indescribable feeling, a feeling she didn’t want to give up. -“You look happy” said a voice behind her. She turned & saw Yuzuru looking at her. He had a smile on his face, because Yuzuru without a smile wasn’t the Yuzuru she knew. -“I’m happy to see everyone happy” she said a little bit shyly, she always felt timid when she was alone with Yuzuru, it was easier when Misha was around, but being alone with him made her nervous. -“I like your outfit” he said, before picking her hood & putting it on her head. \- “We can exchange outfits if you want” she said smiling while putting her hood back in its place, “I’m sure the feathers would suit me better than you”. \- “I don’t know” he answered, “no one is as badass as you”. Evgenia stayed silent because she didn’t know how to answer. It was easy to go for the joke, but when he was earnest, he destroyed all of her walls. -“I wanted to congratulate you” he said softly, taking a step closer to her. \- “For what” she asked quietly. \- “Getting silver of course” he said gently & she felt the understanding on his voice. -“Thank you” she said while looking at the floor “but you’re the one that should get all the praises, two golds is not a small feature Yuzuru”. -“You don’t have to pretend” he said in a whisper & she felt the air leaving her lungs as if someone had punched her. “I know it’s hard, what you did that day, it’s worth more than a medal, you’re a champion Zhenya, never forget it” he said carefully. She looked up not caring anymore he would see the tears in her eyes & she saw the surprise on his face when she went for a hug. -“I’m sorry” she said softly in his arms, she tried to let go because she had acted on impulse, but she felt him hugging her even tighter. \- “Don’t apologize, we all need a hug sometimes” he told her gently finally letting go. -“I know those hugs are exclusive for Pooh-san” she joked while wiping the tears from her eyes. -“He told me he can share the hugs with you & with Luna-chan” he told her in a voice that warmed her heart, she was no match for him, her heart ran wild & beat harder than ever, so she said in a whisper “I think I’m ok with that”. During the rest of the evening she could feel the eyes of Yuzuru following her at times, she knew she surprised him with the hug. They have hugged before but this was different because this time it felt like he was consoling her, so it felt more intimate. She tried to calm herself as she always did, with skating, she started going back on the steps for her program on her mind, she repeated the choreography on loop on her memory while listening to Kukushka on her ipod. She usually listened to Exo before the competitions but tonight she wasn’t competing, she wasn’t even performing, because she wasn’t planning to portray anyone but herself through her program, she was going to express something she couldn’t put into words, something she felt in her heart. This is what skating was for her, not only the sport that she dedicated her life to, but also the place where she could be herself. Even when she played a character there was always a little bit of herself in every show, in every step, in every turn & in every jump. Tonight, her heart was going to stay on the ice. She stayed close to the rink when Gabriella & Guillaume took the ice. She had been watching everyone’s program, from Javier’s fun “Aerobic class” to the romantic performance of Han & Sui with “Run”. She wanted to take it all, because this moment with everyone relaxing & smiling was rare, in less than a month they had to be in Milan for the World Championships & she wasn’t looking forward to it. This would be the last day to relax before she started training for her next competition. That had been her routine for the last four years, competitions during the winter & fall seasons and shows & training through the summer. Time passed by, people changed but ice was always there, as a permanent feature on her life. As she saw Gabriella & Guillaume finish their performance to “Pray you catch me” she got ready to be next. It was always difficult to get back to perform for an audience after a disappointing result in competition, especially when it was an exhibition that relied more in engaging the audience than just concentrating in the technical side of her program. Luckily, she didn’t have to smile or be flirty for “Kukushka”, the dark themes of the song suited the state of her soul at the moment, so it was easy to get lost in the tempo of the song. She skated slowly to the center of the rink after Gabriella & Guillaume left the ice, she could see the flashes, hear the announcer calling her name, she could feel the eyes of every person in the arena, but at that moment she erased them all. This was not a performance for them, this was for herself. To remind herself why she still dedicated her life to this profession, why even after the biggest disappointment in her life she couldn’t imagine doing anything else but going back to what she knew. This was who she is & this was what she wanted to continue doing for as long as she could. She closed her eyes & when she heard the first notes of the song, she felt ready to tell a story through her art again. 	4. Day 15    She could feel every muscle in her body ache at the end of her practice, she had one more week to train before the World Figure Skating Championship started & her goal of revalidating her gold medal there seemed to be more far away than ever</li>

                                <li><b><font color="#659936">Test (2024-08-21 16:22:21.884560):</font></b> 2nd page:<br><br>-“Evgenia”, she heard the voice of Eteri calling her. She skated slowly to the end of the rink where she was standing to hear the reviews of her training. -“Your landings are off” she said severely, “if you don’t have secure landings, you cannot do the combinations”, she reminded her. “You need to stay later tomorrow to practice if you want to catch up to Alina”, she said sternly before turning & walking down to her office. This was common with Eteri, always pointing down the mistakes, but never praising her skaters when things went well, she should be used by now, but sometimes she wished she could get a word of encouragement. She turned to the ice & saw Alina leaving the rink quietly. -“Are you alright?” asked Alina as soon as she reached her. -“Yes, thank you. I’m just tired”, answered Zhenya before walking to the dressing rooms to pick her things so she could go home. As she left the gym, she saw her mom’s car in the parking lot. She always made time to take her to trainings & pick her up everyday, that’s why she felt she had no right to complain. Her mom had already sacrificed enough to make her dreams come true, so the least she could do is to deliver in what has become the dream of both of them. -”Hey honey, how was practice?”, her mom asked as soon as she got in the car. -“It was good, I feel I’m improving” she said without looking at her mom in the eyes while pretending to be busy with her phone. That was a bad habit she had, everytime she felt she couldn’t be honest, she looked at the floor or anywhere else to avoid the eyes of the person she couldn't be sincere to. Wakaba once told her that the expressiveness of her face was her biggest curse but also her biggest weapon. On the ice it was a great help when she needed to portray a character, but on real life it presented a problem because it meant anyone could read her like a book. -“Eteri called me this morning” said her mom, taking her out of her thoughts. -“Why?”, she asked softly, fearing her answer   -“She told me you are having problems with your landings & she’s worried”, she told her while starting the car   Evgenia didn’t answer, didn’t confirm her mom’s suspicions because if she vocalized her fears, she knew she would crumble, so she stayed silent until her mom spoke again. -“Eteri said that there are only two reasons this could be happening & let’s hope it’s not the worst case scenario” she told her in a tone that worried her   -“what is the worst case scenario?”, she asked with fear   -“Skaters start to lose precision & flexibility with age, you’re getting older so it’s normal you cannot jump as easily as other skaters younger than you, the problem is that this would mean you already reached your peak” she said in a straight tone. When her mom put the facts so bluntly she really hated to be the daughter of a former figure skater, if her mom had been just a housewife like Alina’s grandmother maybe she could be more supportive. But that wasn’t the nature of her mom, she always went straight to the point, which might be the reason why she was close with Eteri, they were both painfully frank. -“what is the best case scenario?” she asked hopefully   -“that you might be injured” she answered candidly. Evgenia felt the tears in her eyes, but held it together & simply said   -“then let’s hope for the best case scenario” before putting on her headphones on & staying silent until they reached home. As soon as she reached the apartment she shared with her mom, she took her shoes off & started walking to her bedroom but the voice of her mother made her stop   -“You don’t want dinner?” her mom asked while closing the door of their home. -“You know I can’t eat after 6, least of all so close to competition”, she answered dryly before continuing her way to her bedroom. As soon as she arrived to her destination, she saw a small package on her bed & while picking up the small gift she saw a simple note that said “To Zhenya-chan”. When she opened carefully the wrapping paper she saw that inside there was a cute necklace of a moon & next to it a note that said   “This is your belated Olympic gift, you’re always gold in our hearts, gambatte Zhenya-chan! With love   M & Y”   She smiled to herself & immediately reached for her phone to write to her boys. When the world looked bleak they always put a smile on her face, this was a reminder of what she held dear, after this there was only one way, she was going to fight for a chance. 	5. Day 24    It was loud on the arena, louder than any normal competition, because this wasn’t any normal competition, this was the World’s Championship. After the Olympics, this was the biggest accomplishment any athlete on her field could get. She had already won it twice & she should be relaxed at this stage by now, but this year, after everything than unraveled, this felt like a test. Is this the end of Evgenia Medvedeva? That’s the question everyone in the media was asking. If she lost, it not only reinforced the idea that Alina had come to take her place, but also it would erase what she accomplished, she would be another story to add to the older figure skater losing her place to someone younger narrative. Maybe Eteri was right & she already reached her peak before the Olympics. For two years, she was on the top of her field, but not anymore & although she was still in the podium she knew it was just a matter of time until one of the juniors of her country became a senior & started making things more complicated for her with quads. She made sure to avoid the media while getting ready for the World’s, she didn’t want anything to distract her from her training, but everyday Eteri informed her of new requests for interviews with Alina. The media was enjoying their rivalry & with Yuzuru not participating at the World Championship, the media made sure to hype the battle of the Russian Ladies as much as they could. But that wasn’t what worried her, but the lack of stability she had been showing during the practice of her jumps. She had tried to convince Eteri to allow her to backload her jumps to catch up to Alina, but she had the last word & she told her that as long as she wasn’t having clean landings, she would continue doing three of her jumps before the second half. She also took out the triple lutz, triple loop combination she had been practicing for her program, which meant that just in technical, she was already several points behind Alina. It seemed like only a miracle could help her retain the title. She took a deep breath & started her routine backstage, practicing her jumps while Exo played in her ipod. This felt like a chronicle of a death foretold, she knew the scores even before she stepped on the ice, she never felt as defeated as today. She saw the girls on her group practicing as she did, Satoko (Miyahara) warmed up flexing her legs while Kaetlyn (Osmond) ran from one corner of the room to the other & Alina practiced her spins in the floor. They all looked focus & ready, while she felt more lost than ever, she tried to put on a brave face but she knew what she was going to be facing, after all she had been seeing Alina’s routine for the last three weeks, while practicing next to her for the World’s Championship. \- “What is the mark of a true champion?”, she remembered the question that Tatyana Tarasova asked her the first time she became a World Champion. That time she answered, “the way they deal with success”, but Tatyana simply said “No, my girl. It’s how they face adversity”. Now, she finally understood the depth of her words. Because for two years, she only knew success & maybe during that time she wasn’t a true champion, because her biggest competition was herself. But now, she wasn’t the one leading the group, instead she was the one that had to catch up. And she knew she only had two options, either fight with all her might or settle & be one of the many, another Russian name that would get lost in obscurity after being replaced by a younger skater. Alina would take her place and then someone younger than Alina would come & the cycle would continue. But she refused to be another disposable name in history, she refused to accept her sacrifices meant nothing to her future, she didn’t want her dream to end when it hadn’t even started. So when she heard one of the officials of the event announce to them that they were going to be next on the presentation of the short program, she knew she had to make a choice. And while all the girls started to put on their skates to get ready to hit the ice, she started thinking about the possibilities of the risky decision that she was about to take. And when she finished tying her laces, she held her moon necklace for strength because she knew she had reached one of the most difficult decisions of her life. 	6. Day 30    The season was over for her, “it couldn’t have ended in a worst note”, she thought while she walked Jerry to the park. Summer was near & while she usually looked forward to practice fun routines for the summer shows & catch up with all the animes she missed during the season, this summer felt drearier than ever. For the first time in two years she had missed the podium, she couldn’t even get bronze & this was her own fault. “I knew it was going to be risky” she said to herself. Her last-minute decision to backload all of her jumps didn’t pay off, her foot was still recovering & her stamina didn’t match Alina’s so she fell in her triple Salchow triple toe loop combination. She also got lower GOEs than usual on her jumps, because her landings kept getting sloppier & to top it all, Eteri was mad at her. She didn’t like her decision of changing her program content without consulting her & even when she managed to make it up in the free program following their original script, it wasn’t enough & she ended up being fourth. She knew she was in trouble when Eteri didn’t sat with her at the Kiss & Cry when her results were shown. And she was paying it now, because Eteri had demoted her to train under Sergei (Dudakov), who worked as her right hand on the Training Center. Eteri only managed the top students, so at the moment her main focus was Alina, while she had to raise to the ranks again if she wanted to be considered. Not that it matter, because her last checkup with her doctor shown that she couldn’t train for a month. Her foot was still recovering & all the competitions she had been participating lately, delayed her rehabilitation process. So, she had to sit for the rest of the season & concentrate in getting better, at least that’s what the doctor said. But could she afford to sit & recover? Because that tactic wasn’t working for Adelina (Sotnikova), who was rumored to be retiring soon. Yulia (Lipnitskaya) had already retired & she seemed to be going into coaching. “But at least they got gold”, her doubts murmured in her head. What did she have? She was just a fading star, one that was dying before she actually had the opportunity to shine. A sudden vibration took her out of her thoughts as she saw a new message on her phone. It was from Misha, since the World Championship ended, Yuzuru, Misha & Wakaba had been her main support, sending her funny messages so she could cheer up. Today, it was a Ryan Gosling meme that said “hey girl, the only thing more marvelous than my abs is your smile”. She smiled at his silly joke & only wrote on the group chat she had with her boys   -“How do you always know how to cheer me up Misha?”   He only answered with another meme, this time it was an image of Yuzuru shirtless with the words   -“Hey girl, keep that smile on, or I’ll put my shirt back on”   She laughed this time, and before she could answer she saw that Yuzuru was writing something too   -“You guys know that I can read everything you write, right?”   Misha wrote back   -“Look at the bright side, your shirtless picture made Janny laugh. Now the question is, if she’s laughing because she’s not impressed by your abs, or because my joke was that funny”   Evgenia joined the banter by writing   -“Couldn’t it be the two options?”   Misha continued   -“Don’t be mean to Yuzu, Janny. Remember that he has an army of fans that can hunt you down”   Evgenia simply answered   -“I know, I’m always afraid I would be attacked by a group of girls holding Pooh bears”   Misha quickly wrote   -“That’s the nightmare of every girl that interacts with Yuzu for more than 10 seconds”   Yuzuru joined their game & he simply put   “Don’t worry Zhenya, you know that as a Sailor Soldier your powers would prevent the attack of any Pooh bear in your vicinity. And if all you needed to cheer up was a picture of abs, here is a picture of me & Misha shirtless”   When Evgenia saw the picture, she couldn’t stop laughing, because for once Yuzu wasn’t the bottom of the jokes & he finally paid back Misha’s constant teasing. While she wiped the laughing tears from her eyes, she realized that this was the reason she would never regret getting into figure skating. Regardless of her results, what she would take with her wasn’t only the memories of her triumphs, but also the friends she made thanks to this profession. With that thought on her mind, she set up to make a meme of her own to make her boys smile, at that moment she felt that sense of happiness for being able to enjoy the little things in life, she felt the smell of the beginning of summer reaching her & bringing her hope that maybe her journey wasn’t over. And if it was, what a ride it was. 	7. Day 50    Getting back on the ice after sustaining a long-term injury was never easy. It had been almost a month since she last came to train & from her last check-up things seemed better with her foot. Of course, the doctor said to avoid doing triples at least for two more weeks, but she could return to the ice to do some step sequences. Sergei watched her from a corner following her every move & checking her speed to review her motions later on. Before she stepped on the ice, they had discussed what type of music she was thinking for the new season. During her time away from the rink, that’s all she was thinking, what she could do to restore her position and what type of music would suit her comeback. She had settle on “Coppelia: Act I – Valse” for her free skate program & “Pulcinella suite: VIIIb. Finale. Allegro assai” for her short program. Sergei seemed satisfied with her choices & he told her she would need extra training this summer to be able to backload her jumps as she wanted. She was happy with those news, because it meant she was going to be able to face Alina in the same conditions, but it also meant she would have to train extra hard to be able to have enough stamina to keep all of her jumps at the end of her program. When she finished her practice, Sergei pointed out that she was still a little bit stiff on the ice, but that was normal considering she had stopped training for several weeks. He also told her about some of the offers she had for the summer shows, including Dreams on Ice in Japan again</li>

She already had a song on mind for that show, it was a song she wanted to use for one of her competition programs, but she wouldn’t be able to use it because she had to use ballet songs if she wanted to compete with Alina, because those songs suited better the programs when there was backloading involved. As she left the gym she saw Alina arriving to the Training Center. Now that it was the beginning of summer & she was working with Sergei, she didn’t see Alina as often as before, because they weren’t working together anymore. She waved to Alina from a distance who waved back, but continued her way into the gym without stopping, she knew why. Eteri didn’t like when her students were late & she knew how harder trainings got when she was in a bad mood, so she didn’t blame her. Today, her mom didn’t pick her up from training because she was busy with some errands, and she was planning to ask her to stop bringing her to the gym in the mornings as well. During her time away from the rink she had started to think about asking her mom to keep her distance from her training, maybe if she stopped getting involved with her figure skating, they could have a more normal mother/ daughter relationship, because right now she felt more like a second coach than a mother. The problem is that she didn’t know how to bring the topic to conversation without hurting her mom’s feelings, she knew that making her successful in figure skating had become their joined goal, but right now at her lowest, she didn’t need someone else pushing her harder to get back on shape, she just needed unconditional support, in other words she needed her mom. While waiting to take the subway back home, she saw a guy wearing the best shirt she ever saw & at that moment she wished Yuzuru was with her because he would be the only one else who could understand the joke. But they lived in opposites sides of the world, so she settled for sharing her discovery with him. Carefully she took her cellphone out of her bag & while pretending to write a message, she subtly took a picture of the shirt of the guy, and smiled to herself while she admired the treasure she found. After zooming the picture and checking that the numbers on the shirt were clear, she sent a message to the group chat she had with Yuzuru & Misha. She couldn’t wait for Yuzu to see the picture & maybe give back to him a little bit of the happiness he gave her while he was trying to cheer her up. At that moment the train stopped on the station & she went inside while putting on her headphones, because today “Unravel” would be the soundtrack that would guide her way back home.</li>

Day 64    Impatience wasn’t an attribute that she was known for, but that was the feeling that she had through the morning before the show. After all, most of her morning consisted in interviews with different members of Japanese media to talk about the show “Dreams on Ice”. And while a part of her appreciated the distraction, because keeping herself busy allowed her to push the problems she wasn’t ready to face under the carpet, she couldn’t help but dread that her last hours in Japan had to be giving interviews instead of spending time with her friends. After all this was going to be the last time she stood on the same ice as Misha, unless he continued doing exhibitions as he had hinted. She wasn’t going to see Wakaba again either until the season started & Ekaterina (Bobrova) one of her few Russian friends was debating her retirement to fulfill her longtime dream of becoming a mother.</li>

Day 64    As Evgenia made her way to the rink with David following her from behind, she couldn’t help but feel nervous about Yuzuru & Javier watching her practice. So as soon as they reached the ice, she turned to David unsure if she should share her doubts   -“What’s wrong”, he asked noticing her hesitant expression. -“Maybe it would be better if you start with Javier after all, because I don’t want to bore them watching my program, when I don’t even have any jumps to show them yet”, she expressed nervously. -“It’s too late to do that now, Javier already gave you his training turn. Besides I think they would like what we have done so far”, said David in a kind tone trying to give her some reassurance. -“Maybe we can start adding some of the jumps today”, suggested Evgenia. -“Have you finished training your jumps with Ghislain?”, asked David to bolster his point. -“No, he’s still making me do doubles.</li>

Day 64    Training started as it always did for her for the past two weeks, joining a group of skaters as they followed Tracy (Wilson) on the ice. Among that group she recognized familiar faces that were becoming frequent in the new routine that her life was taking. She could see Gabby trailing behind her, while her brother Zachary adopted a more serious mood on the ice and was fully concentrated on imitating the movements of Tracy along his partner Alison (Schumacher). Cha (Jun-Hwan) stayed closer to Tracy as she explained in a calm manner how every movement they did built agility, balance, coordination & speed. “Remember to listen to your own blade, and follow the sound as the guideline for your movement, forget about how you look & just feel it”, was the instruction that Tracy imparted as they all continued to do the exercises she guided.</li>

Day 64    It was a lazy day for her because it was her day off from training, she had just returned from her last appointment with her doctor & he let her know her foot was better so she could start working on her jumps again. He did recommend she slept with an ice pack on her foot for the next two weeks to finish her treatment & she had to meet him again by the end of the month to confirm her injury had completely healed. She was happy things were finally looking up, and to top it all she was finally going to be able to work on some choreographies for the summer shows. She already told Daniil (Gleichengauz) she was planning to use “Dark Paradise” from Lana del Rey for the two summer shows she confirmed.</li>

Day 64    She had been waiting for the last hour, it was already 10 am and Gorshkov’s secretary hadn’t call her to go to his office yet. She stayed seated nervously as her mom held her hand & gave her an encouragingly smile until a few minutes later the secretary came to where they were seated & said   -“Miss Medvedeva, Mister Gorshkov is ready for you”, she stood up with her mom to go to the office but the secretary pointed out, “only the skater is allowed to go to Mister Gorshkov’s office”   Her mom nodded & asked her “are you ok going alone?”   Evgenia nodded absentmindedly & her mom only said   -“Good luck”   And she walked a distance that felt eternal while she followed the secretary to the office of the President of the Russian Figure Skating Federation.</li>

Day 64    Today it had been their last day of training before they traveled to Yokohama for the “Dreams on Ice” show. And she knew she was going to miss this kind of training environment, the camaraderie, the laughs, these weren’t things she could get in Russia because everyday it was a competition, everyday it felt like she was part of a battle where only the fittest girls could survive. They had just finished the choreography for the “Dreams on Ice” show & while Misha went to change she stayed on the ice practicing by herself. It was rare to have a solo session on the ice, at Eteri’s gym she had to share it with Alina & Polina (Tsurskaya), that’s without counting all the juniors that worked out on that Training Center as well. When she first became a skater, she was in the same position as those girls, looking up to the seniors, dreaming of being on their shoes.</li>

Sick of angels, demons, the apocalypse, the whole nine yards. So now he's in a shopping mall with Dean, trying to sort through a giant mess of a case, but at least it's a regular case, a break from all the end-of-the-world crap that's hanging over them like the sword of Damocles. He's beginning to understand Dean's obsession with finding “normal” cases, the paranormal equivalent of two-point-five kids, a dog, and a white picket fence in the suburbs. So this case, in which people started dying in weird and creative ways, seemed like the way to go for a while. Of course, it's a gigantic mess now: nothing about it makes any sense, because none of the deaths seem related except for the fact that they're all in the same mall, none of it hangs together, and whatever is responsible has a sick sense of humour. There's no wishing well in town, so it's not that. It's enough to make Sam wonder if they haven't stumbled across faeries, except that he's only ever heard of faeries in really old textbooks, and the odds are pretty slim. Faeries stick to the woods, not to shopping malls. In fact, if Sam didn't know better, he'd think it was some sort of ironic commentary on American consumer culture. Still, it 's a way to take their minds off all the death, all the suffering, the weight that's pressing down on them. Also, it takes them away from all the freaking angels, and Sam hasn't been this pleased to be doing something in months, possibly years at this point. Right now, the word “angel” is his least favourite in the dictionary. Sure, there was a time when he prayed every day, at first, the way normal people do. Pastor Jim explained about prayer when Sam was very small, and it seemed like a great idea at the time: to appeal to a higher power for help, for guidance, and sometimes for a puppy (when he was five years old). Then as he grew older he prayed for a whole lot of things: for Dean, for his father, to get him out of hunting (please, God). The last few years, the prayers were more desperate: please, God, don't let Dean die. Please, God, give me back my brother. Please God. Please please please. Then Sam met his first angel, and the angel looked at him as though he was something to be scraped off its shoe, didn't even want to touch him. Sam never felt so filthy in his life, tainted and sick and disgusting. He hasn't prayed in over a year now, stopped the praying the day the angels told Dean to go into a locked room and torture a demon. He's given up thinking that maybe angels are the way he first imagined them. Dean is right, they are douchebags. Meddling, sadistic pricks who don't actually care about God's creations at all. Between Uriel, Zachariah and Lucifer, Sam has had enough angels to last him a lifetime. Castiel is going a long way to earning back Dean's trust (if he ever even lost it), but he still won't come near Sam unless he absolutely has to, and so Sam avoids him as much as he can. And speaking of sadistic douchebags, Sam has reserved a special place in his heart for Gabriel, whom he's known for so long only as “The Trickster.” He's pretty sure he hates him even more than Lucifer. Lucifer, at least, has tried to make nice to Sam in his own weird, twisted way. Sure, it's all a trick to seduce him into becoming a cheap suit, but at least it's a real attempt to seduce. Gabriel, on the other hand, has been going out of his way from the start to make Sam's life even more of a living hell than it already was. It seems like his reasoning follows the same patterns: Dean is going to die? Awesome. You know what would be fun? Making Sam live his death over and over. Even more fun? Making Sam live without him for six extra months, just to see what will happen. For shits and giggles. You know what else is fun? Making him argue with Dean. Shoving them both into a make-believe TV land and tormenting them until they both decide to say “yes” to playing angel condom, because boo-hoo, little Gabriel wants his angelic brethren to get their little apocalypse over with. Gabriel, Sam has decided, is the worst coward of the lot: hiding behind his tricks and his pranks and his sadistic douchebaggery. Fucker. “Oh, come now, I'm not _that_ bad!”  Sam straightens up from where he's been looking at the statue of an overweight man, complete with dirty jeans and black t-shirt from Think Geek, XBox controller held in a death grip. It's a wax effigy, except that not five hours ago he was alive and well and arguing vociferously with someone else in the store about how lame the new reboot of Star Trek was. “I knew it,” Sam is resigned. Can't bring himself to be surprised. “You're way too fond of irony for your own good.”  “What can I say? It's an appealing trope,” Gabriel smirks, hops up to sit on a glass display case full of Wii's and iPods, his short legs dangling ludicrously. He's wearing a really garish shirt, all big prints and loud colours, a leather bomber jacket over it, his hair slicked back with what might be water but looks more like Brillcreem. “The Fonz called. He wants his wardrobe back.”  Gabriel pretends to be wounded. “Oh, Sam, always with the _bon mot_.”  “What do you want?”  “What, I can't just have some fun now and then? I'm taking care of some colossal assholes who think that their possessions are more important than their lives.” Gabriel crosses his legs, folds his arms across his chest, smirks at him. He looks around. “I've always hated malls. Let's take this little pow-wow outside, shall we?”  He snaps his fingers, and suddenly they're outside, Gabriel perched on the hood of the Impala instead of the counter. Sam straightens, rubs the back of his neck, tries to remember where he left Dean. “Dean will kill you for doing that to his car.”  “He's welcome to try. I don't foresee him pulling holy oil out of your ass any time soon.” Sam snorts. “You know what? I don't care. I know there's nothing we can do to stop you. Was there some new and interesting form of torture you wanted to inflict on me this week? How about skipping the preliminaries this time and just making me insane right off the bat?”  “Such a drama queen. I'm amazed Dean has put up with you for so long. That's the trouble, isn't it? That he puts up with you, I mean. Big brother, always looking out for little Sammy, no matter what kind of shit you pull. He's the soul of forgiveness, isn't he?”  Sam's fists clench at his side. “Just... shut up, would you? You don't know what you're talking about.”  “Oh, I think I do. It's pathetic, really, how you have no life outside of him. Sure, you made a big show of going off on your own, going to Stanford, getting a girl, but you hopped right back into the life with alacrity, didn't you, Sammy-boy? Followed wherever big brother led you. And look what happened when he died, the way we all knew he would: you imploded.” Sam feels heat creeping up his neck, suffusing his cheeks. “Self-destructed so fast I almost got whiplash. Addiction is so _cliché_ , too, although I will credit you with putting a creative spin on it by unleashing the apocalypse in the process. And then Dean forgave that too.”  Which just goes to show what Gabriel knows. Dean hasn't forgiven him, not by a long shot. Hell, there's no forgiveness for any of what he's done. “Just... whatever it is you're going to do, can we get it over with?” he asks finally, feeling his shoulders slump. He's tired of arguing with angels. Tired of arguing with Dean, for that matter. Just tired. Gabriel sulks. “You're no fun at all. I'm trying to impart a lesson here, chucklehead, and for once I was trying to do it without resorting to reshaping reality around you.” When Sam doesn't answer, he sighs. “You may not believe this, but I like you, Sam.” Sam snorts derisively at that, and Gabriel holds up a hand. “No, really. You kind of remind me of me, only without the brilliant sense of humour and the impeccable fashion sense. And I'm really sick of watching you trail after your brother like a kicked dog. You're holding each other back, you know. You need to both let go, and follow your destinies.”  “Haven't we already had this discussion?” Sam is getting a headache. “And look how well that turned out. I was hoping you'd listen to me this time, instead of digging in your heels. You think your brother appreciates having to drag you around on a leash all the time? Or has he taught you to walk to heel yet?” there's scorn in the angel's voice now, and Sam feels his temper snap. “Shut up.”  A sigh. “I can see this isn't going anywhere. Fine. Don't say I didn't try being reasonable first.”  Gabriel reaches out and, in a gesture that reminds Sam oddly of Castiel, pokes two fingers against his forehead, just above the bridge of his nose. And everything goes dark. 	2. Chapter 2  Zombies. Straight out of a Romero triple-feature. Slow and shambling and wearing really terrible 1970s clothes. There are only two of them, though, and after two spectacular head shots (he ought to get a prize, but since when is life ever fair that way?) Dean is by himself in an abandoned clothing outlet. Surrounded by jeans, halter tops, and two decomposing corpses that just literally tried to eat his flesh. It's actually kind of awesome. Except for the flesh-eating part: that was gross. He checks to make sure there aren't any more undead lurking behind the display racks, finds a corpse that looks like it's been snacked on, and he puts a bullet through its forehead just to be on the safe side. All things considered, he thinks that whatever is going on, it's not actually about the zombie apocalypse, and that's a good thing: they've already got one apocalypse to deal with, two just feels like overkill. He conducts a sweep of the store, then just outside the door. “It feels like Half-Life 2,” he says to no one in particular. Speaking of which, he hasn't heard from Sam since he headed off into the electronics store. He glides down the deserted hallway, thankful at least that when the dying started in earnest someone had the good sense to evacuate the mall. The electronics store is dark, half the lights out for some reason. It's also deserted, except for one guy who looks like he belongs in a wax museum for the chronically lame and nerdy. “Sam?” He pokes around in the aisles, finds Sam's pack, but no sign of Sam. “Sammy? You in here?” Nothing. He pulls out his cell, dials Sam's number, is rewarded by the sound of Sam's pack ringing shrilly, with the same ring tone he programmed into it a couple of months ago. Sam pretended to be annoyed that he programmed The Muppet Show theme as a ringtone, but Dean can't help but notice that he hasn't changed it yet. Which doesn't solve his more immediate problem of his baby brother being AWOL. He picks up the bag, starts a more systematic sweep of the mall, getting a sinking feeling in the pit of his stomach. “Sam!”  Still nothing. The bookstore is empty (first place to check for Sam), although there's a woman who's become a permanent display case for Oprah's book club, which makes him shudder. He's never watching that show again. The food court is empty, and he helps himself to a still-warm burger (hey, a guy has needs) before moving onto the next place, but eventually he has to reconcile himself to the idea that there's no one here. There are only two floors to this building, it's not that big: a small joint in a podunk town. So the next logical step is to try outside. Sam can't be far, that much is obvious. Sam wanted back into hunting, he's been acting like Dean's freaking shadow ever since Dean got back from the future (and wow, it hurts his head even to say that), and he is definitely not sneaking off to get a fix, or whatever. Ruby's dead, there's been no sign of demon activity, and Dean is definitely, definitely not thinking any thoughts like that because they've put all that shit behind them. “Sammy!”  The parking lot is all but deserted, but he catches sight of a familiar figure leaning up against the Impala, and his heart drops into his stomach. “Get away from my baby, you prick!”  Gabriel shakes his head, clucks his tongue. He doesn't move from where he is, and instead leans over to scratch behind the ears of a large dog sitting at his feet. What is it with this guy and dogs, anyway? “Tsk, temper temper, Dean-o. Hypertension is the silent killer, you know.”  Dean feels his fists clench, his teeth grind together. This is going to cost him a fortune in dental work, if he ever survives the apocalypse. “Are you here to lecture me on how to take care of my arteries?”  There's a derisive snort. “Far be it for me to take your cheeseburgers away. I see you haven't given up that habit either. Well, maybe you'll have a heart attack or a stroke before the apocalypse: seems like as viable a plan as any other you've ever come up with. I hear petting animals is good for your blood pressure,” he pats the dog's head. “Nice dog,” Dean says, since the situation seems to call for it. It is a nice dog, as far as he can tell. He doesn't know much about them, but this one looks big and healthy, its black coat glossy, big hazel eyes staring at him. He didn't know dog's eyes came in that colour. It has a long feathered tail, which thumps on the ground in greeting, its tongue lolling from its mouth. “What happened to the small yappy one?”  “I still have him, but I left him at home. He doesn't like you.”  “How many dogs do you have, anyway?” Dean feels like the conversation has taken a turn for the surreal, but can't quite help himself. “Enough. You like shepherds?”  Dean blinks. “Uh... yeah, I guess. I like dogs, they're fine. Don't have much use for 'em in my line of work, but yeah. Dogs're nice. Have you been smoking up?” he asks, tilting his head a bit. “Don't need to. Life is a natural high.”  Dean feels a tension headache coming on. “Do you know where Sam is?”  “I might.”  “Did you do something to him?”  Gabriel manages to look injured. “Why do you always assume that I've done something?”  “Because you always do?”  “Fair enough. Look, it's not my problem you lost your brother. Maybe you shouldn't be trying to keep him on such a close leash anyway</li>

Look, are you here to do something ironic and whatever, or just to play peanut gallery?”  Gabriel shrugs, and his eyes sparkle with poorly-concealed amusement. “I like the peanut gallery. The snacks are excellent, and provide me with endless ballistic opportunities. But since you're not in a listening mood, I guess I'll just leave you to your search.” He snaps his fingers, disappears. Dean gets the feeling that the finger-snapping is pretty much just for show. “Hey, you forgot your—” but Gabriel is long gone, “dog,” he finishes lamely. “Terrific.” He stares at the dog, which is sitting with its head cocked to one side, staring at him. “Hey, boy,” Dean returns the stare, then ducks his head, checking. “Yep, definitely a boy. Your master is a douche, just so you know. I know you've got the whole unflinching loyalty thing going for you, but you'd be better off putting your trust elsewhere.” He's talking to a dog. Awesome. He's obviously further gone than he thought. “You haven't seen my brother, have you? He's, like, eight feet tall, in serious need of a haircut, and looks like I'm about to kick him most of the time these days. Answers to Sam.”  The dog wags its tail. Thump-thump-thump against the asphalt. “No? Didn't think so.” Dean heaves a long-suffering sigh. It's not really like Sam to up and disappear in the middle of a case —not recently, anyway— and he left all his gear behind, and Dean is trying very hard not to get worried just yet. There could be any number of explanations for this, none of which are particularly reassuring if he thinks about it for too long. “All right. I gotta go look for him.”  He dumps Sam's stuff in the trunk, keeps hold of the cell phone just in case, pulls the map of the area out of the glove compartment and spreads it out on the hood of the Impala. The dog settles at his feet with a whuffing noise, lays its muzzle on its forepaws. It's not a big town, so he figures he can go looking in concentric circles, stay on foot for the time being, to make sure he doesn't drive right by Sam if he's, say, passed out somewhere outside. “He can't be far, right?” he says to the dog. “I mean, supposing he hasn't been zapped somewhere by angels, but so far that's only been my problem. Angels don't like zapping Sam anywhere if they can help it. All right,” he folds up the map, tucks it in the inside pocket of his jacket. “See you around, boy.”  He heads purposefully toward the entrance of the mall, figures he'll use that as a starting point, work his way around. To his surprise, the dog instantly gets to its feet and trots behind him, feathered tail held high behind it. He turns, makes a shooing motion. “You can't come with me. Go find Gabriel. Go on, git!”  The dog stops, tail drooping, and whines at him. “No, I mean it. I have to look for Sam.”  The dog whines again, gives a hopeful wag of its tail, and he sighs. “Are you at least a good tracker?”  The dog cocks its head at him, both ears perked. “I didn't think so. Well, come on, then.” There's a joyous bark, and the dog bounds to his side, tail wagging enthusiastically. “Why couldn't Gabriel have abandoned a bloodhound?” he grumbles. “I don't have any sheep for you to herd, you know.”  The search goes badly. He spends three hours making his way around the mall, through the streets, checking with every passer-by and shop owner he can find, but no one has seen hide nor hair of Sam. It's like he's fallen off the face of the planet, and by now Dean is hard-pressed not to lose his shit. He calls Bobby, for lack of any better idea, but Bobby doesn't have anything helpful to add either. So he keeps looking until the sun sets and it gets too dark to look properly. He heads back to the car, lets himself sink onto the bumper, head in his hands. “Shit shit shit, fuck!”  The dog is still there, has been literally dogging his heels all afternoon and evening. It whines, picking up on his mood, shoves its nose into his ribcage. “I've lost him. What the hell kind of lousy brother am I, that I can't even keep track of Sam when he's a hundred yards away?” he asks the dog. “Some hunter I'm turning out to be. Can't do anything right.”  Predictably enough, the dog doesn't have an answer, and there's nothing left but to head back to the motel. There's a good chance Sam will head back to the room now that they've been separated for so many hours. He pushes himself to his feet, pulls open the door, and nearly gets knocked off his feet as the dog barrels past him and settles into the shotgun seat. “Oh, no you don't!” he leans into the car, makes a grab for the dog. “That's the original leather, you flea-ridden mutt! Get off there!” He tugs fruitlessly at the dog, realizes that it's a lot bigger and a lot heavier than he thought at first. It gives him a shit-eating doggy grin, the furry bastard, and flops onto the seat, tongue hanging out. “We are not going for a car ride,” he informs it sternly. “I don't care how cute you are.” He goes around the car, yanks open the passenger-side door, and tries to haul out the dog, only to meet with a hundred-odd pounds of very determined canine resistance. “Come on! Son of a bitch,” he stops, stares at the dog. “I don't have time for this. Fine, come with me, then, but you can't stay. And don't drool on the upholstery, or so help me I will kick your furry ass out of the car while it's still running.”  He drives back to the motel, the dog panting happily in the seat next to him, grumbles to himself under his breath about becoming a pushover in his old age. If Sam is there, he'll never let him live down being bullied by a creature that habitually drinks out of the toilet. God, he hopes Sam is there. His life is stressful enough as it is. He unlocks the motel room, turns to order the dog to stay, or whatever, but it's already too late: the dog has wormed its way through his legs and is in the room. He shakes his head, knows when he's defeated. If nothing else, it shows that it's Gabriel's dog: stubborn, and bent on driving him nuts. “Sam! Sammy, you here?” There's no answer, but the dog is back at his feet, its tail wagging so hard it's practically a blur of motion. He switches on the light, scans the room for signs that Sam may have come and gone, but there are none. “Sam!” The dog cavorts around him, play-snapping at the air, and he reaches down and pats it absentmindedly, dumps his gear on the floor. He checks his phone messages, but apart from a single text message from Bobby (and the thought of Bobby sending text messages still amuses him to no end) saying that he's checking in with some contacts to see if there's been any indication of weirdness or disappearances in the area, there's nothing. There's nothing on the motel phone either, which he checks out of principle rather than because he really thinks Sam would have left a message there. He sinks down on his bed —the one closest the door, as usual— clasps his hands between his knees, feeling his heart clench in his chest. For the first time, he wonders what he'll do if he can't find Sam, and the thought sends shivers of panic through him. “Dammit, Sam, where are you?”  There's a blur of motion, and before he can so much as flinch the dog has launched itself at his chest. It bowls him backward on the bed and straddles him, soft pink tongue lapping at his face, giving him the most thorough licking he's ever received in his life. He sputters, shoves at it, tries to twist away. “Ack! Get off! That's... ptuh! That's seriously gross, dude. I only kiss girls on the lips. Get off!”  The dog doesn't budge, but it stops licking him. He's stuck, spreadeagled on the bed with a hundred pounds of dog on his chest. It shoves its nose into his face, fixes him with an intense gaze, the weird-coloured hazel eyes seemingly waiting for him to do something, or maybe say something. For the second time that day it occurs to him that he's never seen a dog with eyes that colour, and if it's a black dog, shouldn't it have brown eyes? He blinks at it. No. It can't be. “Sam?”  The dog barks once, and licks the tip of his nose. Oh, shit. 	3. Chapter 3  “Come again?” Bobby's tone is incredulous, and Dean can't blame him. This one is weird, even by Winchester standards. “It's the only thing that makes sense, Bobby,” he says, watching the dog as it sniffs its way around the edges of the room, taking in everything as though for the first time. Well, it sort of is the first time, he supposes. “It —he— even answers to his name. Hey, Sam!” he snaps his fingers. The dog perks up its ears, comes trotting over, and he gives it a friendly scritch behind the ears as a reward, earning himself a tail-wagging. “Are you sure you didn't fall on that fool head of yours, boy?”  “I'm sure, Bobby. One minute I'm fighting off the horde from Dawn of the Dead while Sam is dealing with Night at the Museum in reverse, or whatever, and the next thing I know he's gone and that damned trickster is back in the game. Or angel, or whatever he is.”  “It don't make a lick of sense. Why would he turn your brother into a dog?”  “Beats me. He did go on for a while about my keeping Sam on too short a leash, so maybe he decided to make it literal? Anyway, it doesn't matter. What matters is turning him back. This is seriously too weird for me. My brother is a _sheepdog_ , Bobby.” He pauses. “Are you laughing?”  It sounds suspiciously like Bobby is sniggering. “'Course not. It ain't a laughing matter, is it?”  “Dammit, Bobby, this isn't funny!”  Okay, Bobby is definitely laughing. It sounds as though he's got his hand over the mouthpiece of his phone, but a few seconds later he gives up all pretense, and Dean can hear him guffawing on the other end, hand over the receiver to muffle the sound. “Bobby!”  The dog —Sam, he reminds himself— puts its front paws up on his knees, shoves its head into his face. On the other end of the line, Bobby pulls himself together, still giggling. “Okay, I'm sorry. You gotta admit, it's pretty funny.”  “Hilarious.”  “You're sure it's Sam?”  Dean shrugs, even though Bobby can't see him. “As sure as I can be. It's not like he can answer me in any way that I can understand. He's a dog.”  “Does he know what's happened?”  He shoves the dog back onto the floor, fondles its ears, and it leans into the touch, tail thumping. “I don't think so. I mean, I think he knows he's Sam, but I think he's really a dog, too. I mean, he's all happy and tail-waggy and shit. Sam hasn't been this cheerful in, well, ever.” The realization depresses him. He addresses the dog. “You know you're Sam, right?”  The dog barks once. “I think that's about as much of an answer as I'm ever going to get directly from the horse's mouth. Or the dog's mouth, or whatever.”  Bobby snorts and sounds like he's perilously close to another fit of hysterical laughter. “Okay. Why don't you haul your asses down here, and we'll figure it out. Although I don't need to tell you, boy, that if this is an angel's doing, even if it's just Gabriel, it's going to be damn near impossible to fix unless he wants you to do it.”  “I know,” he rubs his hand over his face. It smells doggy. “I just... God. How does this kind of stuff even happen to us? What am I supposed to do with him in the meantime?”  “He's your brother. Figure something out. At least dogs like to ride in cars.”  Dean lets himself flop backward on the bed with a groan, tosses the cell phone next to his watch and his wallet on the night stand. The dog —Sam, he tells himself again, still can't quite wrap his mind around it— prowls along the walls, determined to explore every inch of baseboard, it seems. It shoves its nose in the salt line over the threshold, sneezes, shakes its head, looks up with that endearing doggy grin, and he finds himself grinning back at it. “At least you're a happy dog. Are you sure you're my emo little brother? There's no way he'd ever let himself be that content. He's all broody and angsty, usually. I figure if he were to turn into a dog he's be one of those dogs with droopy ears and sad eyes. Maybe you're not Sam, maybe you're just some dog named Sam that that freaking trickster left behind just to mess with my head.”  The dog cocks its head to the side, sits on its haunches and watches him. “Do you understand me when I talk? Bark once for 'yes,' twice for 'no. '”  It's possible that that's the stupidest thing he's ever said, he realizes as soon as the words have left his mouth. The dog barks twice, and he has to restrain himself from hitting his head against the wall as hard as he can. “You're doing it on purpose to screw with me now, aren't you?”  The dog barks once. “Fuck you, Sparky.”  The dog barks twice, and then someone hammers furiously on the wall from the room next door. “Shut the fuck up in there!”  He pounds the wall back. “Shut up yourself!” He turns to —Sam. His brain stutters over the name, can't match it to the body. “Okay, no more barking unless we want to get kicked out. I don't know if we're even allowed animals in here.” He stares at the dog, throws up his hands. “You know what? I'm not dealing with this tonight. Maybe we'll luck out and it's a twenty-four hour thing, and you'll be back to normal tomorrow. What kind of dog are you, anyway? I know Gabriel said shepherd, but that doesn't exactly narrow it down.

It figures you'd be some sort of froofy European breed.” The dog just gives him a reproachful look. “Nice-looking dog, though. Says here you're supposed to be good with kids but that you need lots of exercise. Not that I'm anticipating taking you for long walks, or whatever, so you can forget it.”  The dog's ears perk up at that, and he sighs. No saying the “w” word in front of the dog, copy that. He shuts the laptop, shucks his clothes and tosses them on a chair. There's nothing to do now except sleep it off and hope it's all some sort of really weird dream that he'll never, ever mention to Sam, except to tease him for being turned into a fluffy European dog. He crawls under the bedclothes, pulls them up to his chin, reaches over to switch off the light, when the whole bed lurches to the side, swaying alarmingly. “Oh, no! I am not sharing the bed with a dog. You can either take the other bed, or sleep on the floor like a normal dog.”  A moment later he's got a face full of dog, its tongue working over him enthusiastically. “Gah! Get off!” he shoves at it ineffectually, and is definitely beginning to sense a pattern here. “Fine, fine! You can sleep on the bed. Just not on top of me, got it? Jeez, give a guy some space here, mutt.”  The dog chuffs happily, flops down by his legs with an ominous creak of bedsprings. He switches off the light and lies there, staring at the ceiling, listening to the rhythmic thump-thump-thump of its tail against the bedspread. A few moments later it heaves a sigh of contentment, the tail stops wagging, and the only sound to be heard in the room is its soft breathing. He lets his eyes slip closed, unable to worry overmuch with the comforting weight of the dog leaning against his leg, drifts to sleep.</li>

He lies down somewhere out of the way, and waits for Dean to come get him. Dean is his pack, and of course he's going to come and get him, because that's just how things work. Dean is _home-shelter-love_ , and all Sam has to do is wait, and it'll all get better. Except that he doesn't come, and Sam is all alone. He rests his muzzle on his paws, heaves a sigh, tries sleeping. He even succeeds for a while, but not for long. He sits up, scents the air for Dean, but there's nothing there, and he sinks down again, his heart heavy. Eventually hunger overrides _wait-for-Dean_ , and he goes to look for food, because Dean has left his bowl and all the kibble where Sam can't get to it. He finds food in a big metal box —garbage container, he remembers— all greasy meat and potatoes and sauce that he doesn't quite recognize.</li>

Chapter 4  Dean is awakened the next morning by something cold and wet being thrust right under his chin. He snorts and flails, can't quite get his bearings for a moment, and suddenly finds himself face to face with a black muzzle. It all comes back to him in a rush, and he groans. “Still not back to normal, I see?”  The dog gives a desperate-sounding whine, then trots over to the door and scratches at it with one paw. Dean glances at the clock, realizes that it's stupidly early. “I guess when you gotta go, you gotta go,” he mutters, and staggers to the door. He feels like he went on a bender the night before, complete with a nasty taste on his tongue, but alas it looks like he was completely sober and didn't imagine his little brother getting turned into Rin-Tin-Tin. He opens the door. “Out you go. And no, I'm not coming with you.</li>

Chapter 4  Castiel often feels as though the new earth is an alien and hostile place. Until he pulled Dean from the Pit nearly two years ago, he hadn't stepped foot on it in over two thousand years. Human beings haven't changed much, in the grand scheme of things, but they have added layers of complexity to their existence that simply weren't there when he last walked the earth. All the taboos have changed subtly, and he is hard-put most of the time to wrap his mind around the idiom of a language that hadn't even been born when he was last here. English in particular is a fluid, idiosyncratic beast, changing so much from region to region that he considers it a minor miracle that all the English-speaking people aren't constantly at war with each other —he remembers the story of the Tower of Babel, and thinks that America may not be far removed from it.</li>

Chapter 4  “Mama, please can I got outside now?”  Deborah Donnelly heaves a sigh, up to her elbows in dirty dishwater, and looks over her shoulder at where her daughter is standing near the back door, waiting expectantly. Katie-Anne is four feet and three inches of grim determination, holding her boots in one hand and her raincoat in the other. It's been raining steadily for four days now, and while it was easy enough to keep her inside on school days, it's Saturday now, and it's only a matter of time before she wins this particular battle of wills. There's no real reason to keep her inside, either, except for Deborah's maternal instincts which want to keep her daughter safe and dry and warm, none of which will be possible if she goes outside to play in the rain. Then again, playing in the rain and splashing in puddles is a time-honoured childhood rite of passage, and who is she to deny her daughter that pleasure?</li>

Chapter 4  The first snow of the year is falling when Dr. Mallory Yates, B. V. Sc. & A.H., kisses her girlfriend goodbye and pulls out onto the road in her second-hand blue Ford Escape that she just managed to scrape enough money together to purchase last year. Starting out as a country vet isn't exactly the most lucrative proposition in the world, but she wouldn't trade this life for anything. Of course, being the only vet for a forty-mile radius also means that she gets a lot of 2am phone calls to go out and help with lambing, with sick cows in their byres, with colicky horses. It's never exactly comforting to have to go out when it's pitch black, when the only light is provided by the SUV's headlights, when she has to scrape the frost off the windshield and hold the steering wheel with one hand while she blows on the fingers of the other to keep them warm.</li>

Chapter 4  In spite of Mallory's optimism, it's kind of touch-and-go with Sam for a while. She spends the night forcing fluids into him with an IV drip, and quickly finds that she has to resort to a sedative in spite of the pneumonia, because he keeps wriggling and trying to jump down first from the exam table and then away from the x-ray machine. Even sedated, he keeps looking first at her, then at the door, as though he has somewhere pressing to be and doesn't really have time to deal with this injury nonsense, occasionally whining at her as though asking her to let him out again. “Sorry, buddy. We have to get you all fixed up before you can go anywhere.”  His tail thumps once, but she feels oddly guilty when his big hazel eyes land on her with a look that's oddly reproachful.</li>
