                <li title="(Average Test Accuracy - %) The accuracy can be computed for each test by dividing the score achieved by the maximum score possible for that test. We then average all tests' accuracies together. This can be viewed as a uniformly-weighted score average."><b>Accuracy</b>: 80 %</li>

                <li title="(LTM Points) The GoodAI LTM Score is computed from the number of tokens that separate the relevant information from the final question in each test. In every case, this distance is weighted by the accuracy achieved in the corresponding test."><b>LTM Score</b>: 1560049 LTM points</li>

It's important to follow each step carefully to ensure the drone operates correctly and safely. Here are a few additional tips to consider:<br><br>- **Safety First**: Before flying, always check local regulations regarding drone usage, as there may be restrictions in certain areas or requirements for registering your drone.<br>- **Battery Care**: Make sure the battery is not only fully charged but also in good condition. Handle the battery with care and never use a damaged battery.<br>- **Firmware Updates**: Occasionally, the manufacturer may release firmware updates for your drone. Check for updates in the app to ensure your drone has the latest features and improvements.<br>- **Flight Environment**: Choose a wide-open space for your first flights, away from people, animals, and obstacles. Indoor flying is not recommended for beginners unless the drone is specifically designed for it.<br>- **Weather Conditions**: Avoid flying in bad weather conditions such as high winds, rain, or snow, which can affect the drone's performance and control.<br>- **Practice**: Start with simple maneuvers and practice in an open area to get a feel for how the drone responds to the controls.<br>- **Emergency Procedures**: Familiarize yourself with the drone's emergency features, such as automatic return-to-home or emergency landing, in case you encounter any issues during flight.<br><br>Remember to always fly responsibly and have fun exploring the capabilities of your new XYZ drone!

It's always disappointing to accidentally burn food, especially something as delightful as brownies. Hopefully, your oven is okay, and you'll have better luck next time you bake. Remember to set a timer to avoid such mishaps in the future. If you need a new brownie recipe or any baking tips, feel free to ask!</li>

The termite is asking if the "bar is tender" as in soft and good for eating, since termites feed on wood. It's a clever twist on the usual meaning of "bartender," the person who serves drinks at a bar. It's always fun to hear a good pun!</li>

One fish is making a pun by treating their water tank as if it were a military tank, wondering how to operate it as a vehicle. It's a classic example of wordplay where the expectation of the listener is subverted for comedic effect.</li>
