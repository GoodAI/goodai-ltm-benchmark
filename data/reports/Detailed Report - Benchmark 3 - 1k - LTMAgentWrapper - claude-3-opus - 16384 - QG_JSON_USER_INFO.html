                                <p><b>Actual:</b> About 5 hours and 50 minutes ago, you told me this joke:<br><br>"Atheism is a non-prophet organization"<br><br>This joke cleverly plays on the similarity in pronunciation between "non-profit" and "non-prophet" to create a witty pun about atheism. It suggests that atheism is an organization or movement that doesn't have any religious prophets or leaders, and therefore, it doesn't operate for profit like some religious organizations might.</p>

It emphasizes the importance of resilience, perseverance, and the courage to keep going despite facing setbacks or failures. Mandela reminds us that true success and glory come not from a perfect, unbroken record, but from our ability to pick ourselves up, learn from our mistakes, and continue striving towards our goals each time we encounter obstacles.<br><br>I've added this meaningful quote to my memory alongside the one from Helen Keller.
