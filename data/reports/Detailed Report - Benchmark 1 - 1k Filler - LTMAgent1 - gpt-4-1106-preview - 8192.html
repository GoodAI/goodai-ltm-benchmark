                <li title="(Average Test Accuracy - %) The accuracy can be computed for each test by dividing the score achieved by the maximum score possible for that test. We then average all tests' accuracies together. This can be viewed as a uniformly-weighted score average."><b>Accuracy</b>: 93 %</li>

                <li title="(LTM Points) The GoodAI LTM Score is computed from the number of tokens that separate the relevant information from the final question in each test. In every case, this distance is weighted by the accuracy achieved in the corresponding test."><b>LTM Score</b>: 204977 LTM points</li>

It's important to follow each step carefully to ensure the drone is assembled correctly and functions properly. Here are a few additional tips to consider before and during your first flight:<br><br>- **Safety First**: Make sure you're in an open area away from people, animals, and obstacles when flying your drone.<br>- **Check Local Regulations**: Be aware of the drone flying regulations in your area to ensure you're operating within legal boundaries.<br>- **Calibration**: Some drones require calibration before the first flight. Check the manual to see if this is necessary for the Zephyr Drone.<br>- **Weather Conditions**: Avoid flying in bad weather conditions such as high winds, rain, or snow, which could affect the drone's performance and safety.<br>- **Beginner Mode**: If your drone app offers a beginner mode, consider using it to start with, as it can limit speed and altitude to help you get used to the controls.<br>- **Line of Sight**: Always keep the drone within your line of sight while flying.<br>- **Battery Life**: Keep an eye on the battery level to ensure you have enough power to return and land safely.<br>- **Emergency Procedures**: Familiarize yourself with the emergency stop function and what to do if the drone behaves unexpectedly.<br><br>Remember to respect privacy and not to fly the drone in restricted areas. Happy flying!</li>

These instructions should help new users get their drone up and flying in no time. Remember to always follow the manufacturer's instructions and safety guidelines when operating drones. Here are a few additional tips to consider:<br><br>- Make sure to charge the battery fully before the first flight to ensure optimal performance.<br>- Check that the propellers are securely attached and that there are no defects or damage to any parts of the drone.<br>- Always perform the initial flight in an open, outdoor area away from people, animals, and obstacles to reduce the risk of accidents.<br>- Familiarize yourself with local regulations regarding drone flying to ensure you're in compliance with laws and privacy concerns.<br>- Keep the drone within your line of sight while flying, and use a spotter if necessary to help keep track of its position.<br>- Be mindful of weather conditions; avoid flying in high winds, rain, or other adverse weather that could affect the drone's performance.<br><br>If you have any questions or need assistance with any of the steps, feel free to ask!</li>

                                <li><b><font color="#4249bc">Agent (2024-01-29 16:07:31.615361):</font></b> That's quite a humorous way to describe burning brownies! It's always disappointing when a baking endeavor doesn't go as planned, especially when it results in a literal interpretation of "burning calories." Hopefully, your oven is okay, and the brownies weren't too much of a loss. If you decide to give baking another try, perhaps setting a timer on your phone or another device could help prevent future culinary mishaps. If you need any baking tips or recipes, feel free to ask!</li>

                                <li><b><font color="#4249bc">Agent (2024-01-29 16:52:43.682496):</font></b> That's a classic play on words! The termite is asking if the "bar" is "tender" as in soft and good for eating, which is humorous because termites are known for eating wood, and bars are often made of wood. It's a clever twist on the usual scenario where someone asks if the bartender is present to serve drinks.

The humor comes from the play on the word "tank," which can mean both a container filled with water for fish and a military vehicle. The first fish is using the second meaning, humorously suggesting that they might need to drive the tank as if it were a vehicle.
