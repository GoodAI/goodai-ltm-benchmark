                <li title="(Average Test Accuracy - %) The accuracy can be computed for each test by dividing the score achieved by the maximum score possible for that test. We then average all tests' accuracies together. This can be viewed as a uniformly-weighted score average."><b>Accuracy</b>: 87 %</li>

                <li title="(LTM Points) The GoodAI LTM Score is computed from the number of tokens that separate the relevant information from the final question in each test. In every case, this distance is weighted by the accuracy achieved in the corresponding test."><b>LTM Score</b>: 199832 LTM points</li>

This proverb from the Tao Te Ching emphasizes the importance of taking the first step towards a goal, no matter how daunting the journey may seem. It's a reminder that all progress starts with the decision to begin and that even the longest and most difficult ventures have a starting point. If you're drawing a parallel to Jayden entering the TV room, it could symbolize the beginning of an experience or journey for them.

This perspective can help reduce stress and increase overall happiness by focusing on the positive aspects of life, rather than constantly seeking out grand or material achievements.
