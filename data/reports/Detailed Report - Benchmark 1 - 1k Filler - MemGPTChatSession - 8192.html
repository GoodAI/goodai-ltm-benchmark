                <li title="(Average Test Accuracy - %) The accuracy can be computed for each test by dividing the score achieved by the maximum score possible for that test. We then average all tests' accuracies together. This can be viewed as a uniformly-weighted score average."><b>Accuracy</b>: 47 %</li>

                <li title="(LTM Points) The GoodAI LTM Score is computed from the number of tokens that separate the relevant information from the final question in each test. In every case, this distance is weighted by the accuracy achieved in the corresponding test."><b>LTM Score</b>: 100653 LTM points</li>
