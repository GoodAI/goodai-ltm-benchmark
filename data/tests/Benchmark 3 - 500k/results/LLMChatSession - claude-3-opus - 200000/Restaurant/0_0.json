    "Test (2024-04-20 18:35:13.748543): (On TV) Ava moved the skirt to the bottle.\n",
    "Agent (2024-04-20 18:36:56.499280): It seems the story has taken an intriguing turn, with the character Ava moving a skirt to a bottle for some reason. Without more context it's unclear what her motivation might be. Perhaps she is hiding the skirt, using the bottle as an unlikely storage spot. Or the skirt and bottle could be symbolic of something deeper in the plot. In any case, this action by Ava is likely significant to the story arc and may have ramifications later on. I'll continue monitoring the show to see if the meaning behind this scene becomes clearer as the narrative unfolds. Let me know if you notice any other interesting developments!",
