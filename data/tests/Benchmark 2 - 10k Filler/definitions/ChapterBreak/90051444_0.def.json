It is forever changing and being twisted. But, one cannot outrun their fate, because, it's believed that everyone will always have one. Archie Andrews is sixteen years old when he learns this. Riverdale High is buzzing with the knowledge that Southside High is being closed down. With this, students from that particular school are transferring to the clean-cut Riverdale. A majority of the students are furious at this development, but some more than most. \u201cWhat do you think they will accomplish?\u201d Cheryl Blossom asks. \u201cSending trailer trash like them to this school.\u201d  \u00a0  Betty Cooper sighs and shares a glance with her best friend, Archie Andrews. For someone who claims to dislike them, Cheryl spends an awful amount of time bothering them during school hours. \u201cMaybe it\u2019s a good idea?\u201d Betty asks, picking at a salad with her fork. She\u2019s deliberately dodging Cheryl\u2019s eyes and the fiery redhead knows this. She switches her attention to Archie. \u201cWell?\u201d Cheryl asks sounding petulant. Archie\u2019s face melts into confusion and he looks between the two girls. \u201cMaybe it won\u2019t be so bad?\u201d Archie voices and Cheryl huffs, running a hand through her hair. \u201cOf course you would agree.\u201d Cheryl states. \u201cWhat? Are you two dating now?\u201d  \u00a0  Archie stammers while Betty blushes and denies the accusation quickly. As much as Betty likes Archie, she knows he doesn\u2019t see her that way. It hurts, but there\u2019s no point in pressuring him. He\u2019s her friend; she doesn\u2019t want to lose that. Cheryl stares at them like they\u2019re bugs under her designer shoes and she rolls her eyes. \u201cI think that this development is horrible,\u201d Cheryl says, despite the fact that neither Betty nor Archie asked. \u201cAnd I will not let some trailer trash pull down this school\u2019s GPA.\u201d  \u00a0  With that, Cheryl leaves. Her red hair blows in the wind and she walks as though she is a god. Archie watches her leave and when she is completely out of site, he shares an exasperated look with Betty. Archie mentally prepares himself for the oncoming storm. * * *  \u00a0  Betty volunteers to help the Serpents\u2019 transition to Riverdale High. This is how Archie finds himself standing beside Betty as she sorts through the registration desk that she created. \u201cThey\u2019ll be here any second,\u201d Betty says as she glances at the time. Archie can sense the anxiety in her voice and he places a comforting hand on her shoulder. She smiles at him and they turn when the door opens and a group of Serpents walk through. The leader is a dark haired boy who is strangely familiar to Archie. He is surrounded by other Serpents and Archie\u2019s eyes flash to another black haired boy who towers over the others. The Serpent\u2019s dark eyes meet Archie\u2019s for only a moment but to Archie, it feels like eternity. The Serpent looks away from Archie, disinterested and it stings. It shouldn\u2019t, but it does. As the Serpents meet Betty and Archie at the table, it occurs to Archie as to why the leader seems so familiar. \u201cJughead?\u201d Archie asks, shock and confusion echoing in his voice. The leader\u2019s blue eyes meet his and after a moment, they widen slightly. \u201cArchie Andrews,\u201d Jughead says and smirks at the redhead. \u201cIt\u2019s been a while.\u201d  \u00a0  \u201cYeah.\u201d Archie responds, smiling at his childhood best friend. The last time Archie saw Jughead was when they were twelve. The boys had practically been raised as brothers since their fathers\u2019 had been best friends and business partners. Everything had fallen down around their ears when Jughead\u2019s mother left him and his father, which resulted in his father beginning to drink. Due to stress, Archie\u2019s father Fred had no choice but to let go so that they were no longer working on construction together. Because of this, Jughead had been forced to move from Riverdale Middle School and transfer to the Southside. Their friendship and brotherhood had collapsed and all that was left were old memories that are starting to fade. Jughead looks better now, Archie thinks. He is comfortable with the Serpents and the jacket that bears their logo rests comfortably on Jughead\u2019s frame. \u201cAnyway,\u201d Betty says and she claps her hands together. Archie\u2019s eyes snap to hers and she\u2019s looking at him", "2nd page:\n\nAs children, it had been Archie&Betty or Archie&Jughead. The children never crossed this. \u201cWelcome to Riverdale High.\u201d Betty says and locks eyes with Jughead. \u201cHere you can find your class timetable and locker combination, as well as sign up for any school extracurricular activities.\u201d  \u00a0  Betty and Jughead are still looking intently at one another and Archie finds himself confused at the action. \u201cWe encourage-\u201c But Betty is cut off from a voice behind the Riverdale High teenagers. \u201cWait right there.\u201d Cheryl exclaims as she walks down the stairs, Reggie beside her along with various cheerleaders and football players. \u201cCheryl. What are you doing?\u201d Betty whispers harshly. \u201cWhile you and your precious \u2018boy next boy\u2019 may feel comfortable inviting these snakes into our school, we are not.\u201d Cheryl sneers at Betty and Archie sighs. \u201cReally?\u201d Archie asks Reggie, who shrugs in turn. \u201cAre you really comfortable with them at our school?\u201d Reggie questions Archie, and Archie is stumped. He wasn\u2019t lying when he told Cheryl that having the Serpents\u2019 transfer wouldn\u2019t be too bad. But, he wasn\u2019t sure if he was comfortable with a group of gang-related teenagers at Riverdale High. He looks to Jughead, who is already looking at Archie. Archie notices that the other Serpents\u2019 are looking at him too, including the tall black haired boy. \u201cIt\u2019s not my place.\u201d Archie says finally. \u201cIt isn\u2019t yours either.\u201d  \u00a0  Archie can tell Reggie is furious at his response. \u201cEnough.\u201d Cheryl snaps, \u201cReggie, get over your little one-sided crush.\u201d  \u00a0  Reggie stutters but Cheryl only steps forward toward the Serpents\u2019. Archie doesn\u2019t understand what Cheryl means but he figures it\u2019s not the time to dwell on it. \u201cI will not allow Riverdale High\u2019s above average GPA to suffer because of classrooms that are overcrowded with underachievers.\u201d Cheryl states and looked one of the female Serpent\u2019s up and down. The Serpent did not take that statement lightly and she glared at Cheryl. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you say that to my face?\u201d The girl asks through gritted teeth. \u201cHappily,\u201d Cheryl says. \u201cQueen of the Buskers.\u201d  \u00a0  \u201cOkay, guys,\u201d Archie says, in an attempt to diffuse the tension. He moves between the Serpents and his fellow students. \u201cEveryone, can we just put our Northside-Southside differences apart and start over?\u201d Archie looks at Jughead, and notices a small smile on Jughead\u2019s face as he looks at Archie. \u201cA new slate?\u201d Archie asks as his eyes move to the tallest of the Serpents. Archie doesn\u2019t know if he imagined it, but it seemed like in that moment, the black haired Serpent\u2019s eyes softened. \u201cYou don\u2019t speak for the Bulldogs, Andrews.\u201d Reggie snaps and stands toe-to-toe with Archie. \u201cYou lost that right when you turned down the captaincy.\u201d Reggie mocks and Archie breathes in deeply. It bothers Archie that Reggie has the nerve to throw that in his face. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t be the captain if it wasn\u2019t for me.\u201d Archie states, rage building inside of him. \u201cThe coach asked me first.\u201d  \u00a0  He could hear chocked laughter behind him. He wonders which of the Serpents it was; he hopes it was the tallest of them. \u201cThat\u2019s enough.\u201d Mr. Weatherbee states as he arrives, glancing between the students gathered in the hallway. \u201cGet to class.\u201d He says. \u201cNow.\u201d  \u00a0  With that, the students, including Archie dispersed and made their way to their classes. Archie had a feeling that nothing would be the same. \t2. two  Archie does not think of himself as a romantic. Despite this, he knows the lyrics to so many love songs and although he would deny it, has read classical romance novels. In his defense, it was during a time when Betty had forced him to join a book club with her when they were fourteen. But, he does believe in love. The only problem? He\u2019s never been in love. He\u2019s been infatuated with girls before and even found himself thinking about boys more than once. But, he\u2019s never been in love. At least, not the soul crushing, heartbreaking kind. The kind that persuades writers to write and singers to sing. He thinks it's an odd thought", "3rd page:\n\nLike Archie, she wears her heart on her sleeve. But when he tries to imagine a future with her all he sees is a dark tunnel. When Archie Andrews imagines the person he will fall in love with, he imagines black hair and dark eyes. * * *  \u00a0  Archie is sitting in biology with Cheryl when he sees Jughead again. Jughead enters the room with two other Serpents; the tall boy and the pink haired girl Cheryl clashed with in the hallway earlier that day. When Jughead sees Archie, he grins and Archie finds himself smiling back. \u201cHow are you, Arch?\u201d Jughead asks as he stops by the bench that Archie and Cheryl occupy. \u201cGood,\u201d Archie nods. He looks at the other Serpents and Jughead notices. \u201cThis is Toni,\u201d Jughead introduces the pink haired Serpent and Archie smiles at her. She smiles back warmly. \u201cAnd this,\u201d Jughead says and nods to the black haired Serpent. \u201cThis is Sweet Pea.\u201d  \u00a0  \u201cSweet Pea?\u201d Archie asks, raising an eyebrow. \u201cProblem?\u201d Sweet Pea asks coldly. \u201cNot at all,\u201d Archie replies quickly. The black haired Serpent is one of the most intimidating people Archie has met, although he does live on the Northside of Riverdale, so perhaps that\u2019s not saying much. Jughead smirks at their interaction and pats Archie\u2019s shoulder. \u201cSee you after class.\u201d Jughead says and moves in order to find a seat. Sweet Pea and Toni follow quietly. Archie notices Cheryl looking at him but he only shrugs. He has nothing to say. She stares for a moment longer and her gaze feels heavy and judgmental. When she finally looks away, Archie allows himself to breath. Archie tries to ignore the Serpents but he can\u2019t help looking at them. All three of them are enigmatic, especially Sweet Pea and Jughead. Archie wonders what Jughead\u2019s life has been like in the past years. He endures to find out. * * *  \u00a0  Cheryl Blossom is popular, beautiful and talented. She tells herself this in the mirror everyday before school. It is easy to pretend that she is a cold-hearted monster, but when she is alone, the loneliness sets in. Cheryl Blossom is lonely, sad and broken. She ignores all of this. The redhead acts as though she hates Betty and Archie, but she doesn\u2019t. She tries, but she can\u2019t. She looks at them and wishes she were one of them. She wants to be one of them. She wants the walks home, the milkshakes at Pop\u2019s and listening to Archie\u2019s music. She wants all of it. Perhaps it\u2019s tedious, but she remembers a time as a child when she had fallen over and scrapped her knee. Jason had been home sick at day and when she fell, the other children stared and laughed. Tears had stung her eyes and threatened to fall, but then she blinked and saw a hand in front of her. The hand belonged to Archie Andrews, a boy she had known all her life but never talked to. He had always been seen with the weird dark haired Jones boy, or the kind Betty Cooper. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d Archie had asked and she had clenched her fists. \u201cHere,\u201d Archie had said and taken her hands in his. He lifted her up and pulled her along. In her confusion, she hadn\u2019t resisted. They walked to the nurse\u2019s office and Archie stayed with her as the nurse placed a Band-Aid on her scrapped knee. Later, he had let Cheryl join him on the school swings. Little Archie had pushed her with all his might and little Cheryl had laughed and laughed and laughed. Cheryl remembers that happiness, even at sixteen. She wants it again. * * *  \u00a0  \u00a0  Archie sits in the student lounge, along with Betty and Kevin Keller. Kevin is expressing his supposed knowledge on the new Riverdale students, and after listening to Kevin, Archie isn\u2019t sure if he believes the rumours flooding the school. \u201cThey\u2019re probably rumours.\u201d Betty says, voicing Archie\u2019s own thoughts. \u201cNo!\u201d Kevin denies, vehemently. \u201cMidge told me. She doesn\u2019t lie.\u201d  \u00a0  That\u2019s true, but the words themselves don\u2019t seem true. \u201cKevin\u2026\u201d Betty says, looking at Kevin as though he is a child. Archie bites into his sandwich as he watches the teenagers bicker back and forth", "4th page:\n\n\u201cHey,\u201d Kevin finally says. \u201cI get it. You and Jughead Jones were practically undressing each other with your eyes.\u201d  \u00a0  Betty gasps and Archie\u2019s eyebrows fly up. He hadn\u2019t expected that. \u201cThat\u2019s\u2026 That\u2019s not why I\u2019m defending them.\u201d Betty denies quickly and Archie thinks she says it too quickly. \u201cNo judgment.\u201d Kevin laughs, \u201cRight, Arch?\u201d  \u00a0  Archie nods but he\u2019s still processing the day\u2019s events and the words that were spoken between Kevin and Betty. Does Betty like Jughead? Archie wonders. He hadn\u2019t really thought about it. It was possible and although concerned, it didn\u2019t bother Archie too much. He thinks it would be ironic if both his childhood best friends fell in love with one another. What does bother him is that fact that the Serpents are a gang. They\u2019re dangerous, even teenage ones. But, Jughead isn\u2019t dangerous, Archie finds himself thinking. He\u2019s the dark haired boy Archie had spent most of his youth with. They had done almost everything as children together. There was a time where the boys knew each other better than they knew themselves. Archie closes his eyes for a moment and sighs. His thoughts seem to be at war with each other and suddenly, Archie feels terribly tired. He excuses himself from Betty and Kevin, and ignores Betty\u2019s concerned look. Walking through the hallway, Archie pauses when he sees Jughead with his Serpents. Thinking quickly, Archie calls out to Jughead and waits for the Serpent to separate himself from his friends. Many of the Serpents shoot Archie a distrustful look, but he ignores that. \u201cA Northsider?\u201d Jughead mocks, smirking at the redhead. \u201cSpeaking to a Southsider? Revolutionary.\u201d  \u00a0  \u201cHa. Ha.\u201d Archie says, rolling his eyes. \u201cVery funny.\u201d  \u00a0  \u201cCan we talk?\u201d Archie asks the Serpent, suddenly feeling nervous. \u201cAren\u2019t we talking now?\u201d Jughead teases, but then turns serious. \u201cSure, Archie.\u201d  \u00a0  They walk out of the school building and into the courtyard, the silence between them builds and Archie begins to feel slightly agitated. Archie\u2019s classmates turn to look at them and they look either surprised or critical. Archie leads them to a spare bench and sits quietly, waiting for Jughead to do the same. It\u2019s silent until both boys try to talk first and thy end up stumbling. Archie smiles slightly, while Jughead grins. \u201cIt\u2019s good to see you again, Juggie.\u201d Archie says and looks at Jughead with his doe-like eyes. \u201cYeah,\u201d Jughead replies. \u201cThings have definitely changed, haven\u2019t they?\u201d  \u00a0  \u201cI\u2019m a Southside Serpent,\u201d Jughead continues. \u201cWhile you\u2019re this popular football jock.\u201d  \u00a0  Something in Jughead\u2019s tone makes Archie look down. There\u2019s a slight bitterness in Jughead\u2019s voice and Archie\u2019s heart bleeds. He wonders what Jughead has had to endure these past years. \u201cJug, I\u2019m sorry about what happened between our dads.\u201d Archie finally says. It feels like a weight had been on his chest these last years, and after saying those words, he feels lighter. \u201cDon\u2019t be,\u201d Jughead replies and looks at the table. \u201cI get why your dad did what he did.\u201d  \u00a0  \u201cMy dad was a mess after my mum left.\u201d Jughead\u2019s voice turns distant and Archie looks at the Serpent. \u201cIs he okay?\u201d Archie asks and Jughead looks at him. \u201cYour dad. Is he okay now?\u201d  \u00a0  Jughead smiles sardonically. \u201cHe has good days and bad days.\u201d Jughead replies. \u201cBut, doesn\u2019t everyone?\u201d  \u00a0  The two teenagers fall into silence once again, and Archie attempts to sort out his whirling thoughts. Finally, Archie speaks. \u201cI want to be friends again,\u201d Archie states and Jughead smiles slightly. \u201cCan we?\u201d  \u00a0  \u201cTo be discussed.\u201d Jughead says, smile widening. \u201cOver many burgers and many days.\u201d  \u00a0  \u201cAt Pop\u2019s?\u201d Archie asks, smiling brightly. Jughead groans and throws his head back. \u201cI\u2019ve missed those burgers,\u201d And Archie laughs. The ringing of the bell interrupts them and the teenagers smile at each other. \u201cBest be off to class, golden boy.\u201d Jughead says and the boys stand up together. Walking side-by-side together, it felt natural and warm", "5th page:\n\nIt felt like they were children again. \t3. three  \u00a0The moment Archie enters his house, he lets out a groan and falls onto his couch. Vegas takes that as his queue to jump onto the redhead and Archie laughs as his dog attempts to lick his face. \u201cGood boy,\u201d Archie says through his laughter. \u201cI missed you too.\u201d  \u00a0  To Archie, the day had felt like it would never end. It felt like the longest day of his life. As Archie pets Vegas, his thoughts drift to Jughead, and that Serpent, Sweet Pea. Archie understands why he\u2019s thinking of Jughead, but he can seem to figure out why he feels so drawn to the black haired Serpent. Archie had barely spoken to him. All Archie can say is that there was something about his almond eyes and smirk that pulles Archie in. He wants to dismiss the Serpent as just another Southsider, however he can\u2019t. On the other hand, Archie feels content at the conversation he had with Jughead earlier in the day. Archie feels confidant that he can become friends with Jughead again. He has this fantasy that they will become best friends again and it will be like these last four years never happened. It may seem unrealistic, but Archie has always been optimistic. It is why he and Jughead had worked so well; he was the optimist, while Jughead had been the pessimist. Archie is drawn out of his thoughts at Vegas licking his face. At some point, Archie must have subconsciously stopped patting Vegas, and like the needy dog he was, Vegas must have decided to lick Archie to draw attention back onto himself. The redhead huffs and goes back to petting his dog. * * *  \u00a0  \u201cWell,\u201d Toni Topaz says. \u201cToday wasn\u2019t so bad.\u201d  \u00a0  Jughead looks up from his computer and watches as Toni cleans the countertop of the bar at the Wyte Wyrm. \u201cIf you say those Northsiders treating us like we\u2019re the scum of the Earth not \u201cso bad\u201d,\u201d Sweet Pea says from the pool table. \u201cThen yeah, it wasn\u2019t.\u201d  \u00a0  Jughead looks back at his computer, while Toni sighs. \u201cCome on, Sweet Pea.\u201d Toni says, exasperated. \u201cI saw you looking at that redheaded Northsider.\u201d  \u00a0  Jughead feels himself jolt at those words, but he looks at the screen of his computer intently. He knows that they\u2019re talking about Archie and he\u2019d never admit it makes him slightly uncomfortable. \u201cSure,\u201d Sweet Pea admits. \u201cHe\u2019s hot, but he\u2019s a Northsider. I\u2019d never touch one, unless it was to punch them.\u201d  \u00a0  \u201cIf you say so.\u201d Toni says slightly, a teasing look on her face. \u201cYeah,\u201d Sweet Pea replies, hotly. \u201cI do.\u201d  \u00a0  \u201cCan we stop talking about Archie Andrews?\u201d Jughead intercepts quickly. He glares at his fellow Serpents. \u201cTalking about my best friend like that? It\u2019s weird.\u201d  \u00a0  \u201cBest friend?\u201d Sweet Pea asks, turning to face Jughead and Jughead realizes his mistake. \u201cLeave it.\u201d Jughead snaps and begins to type words into the computer, attempting to feign working on his novel. \u201cOkay,\u201d Toni says. \u201cWhat about the blonde girl?\u201d  \u00a0  Betty Cooper. Like Archie, it had been years since Jughead had seen her. She had always been this kind, blonde-haired princess and it seems like nothing has changed. She\u2019s beautiful, Jughead thinks. Very beautiful. He knows nothing can happen between them. The Serpents wouldn\u2019t tolerate him being in a relationship with her. They may not even tolerate him being friends with Archie again. Jughead hates the Northside and their privilege, but he can\u2019t hate Archie. He can\u2019t even find himself hating Betty. Already Jughead can feel himself fraying at the edges. * * *  \u00a0  In English the next day, Archie finds himself sitting next to the pink-haired Serpent, Toni. He watches as she fills out a white sheet of paper and his curiosity peaks. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Archie asks, before the teacher arrives. Toni looks at him for a few long seconds before replying. \u201cFilling out this extracurricular sheet.\u201d  \u00a0  \u201cOh,\u201d Archie says", "6th page:\n\n\u201cSure,\u201d Toni replies. \u201cGive it your best shot, boy wonder.\u201d  \u00a0  Archie thinks for a long moment. \u201cYou could try cheerleading?\u201d Archie says, phrasing it more like a question. \u201cYeah,\u201d Toni grins. \u201cIf I want Cheryl Blossom to kill me.\u201d  \u00a0  \u201cShe\u2019s not that bad,\u201d Archie defends and Toni raises an eyebrow again. Archie has a feeling that will be Toni\u2019s signature look when she talks to him. \u201cShe isn\u2019t!\u201d Archie insists and Toni only laughs lightly. \u201cIf you say so,\u201d Toni says and as soon as Archie opens his mouth to reply, the teacher walks in, cutting him off. Throughout the class, he and Toni share various grins and Archie feels content with that. * * *  \u00a0  \u201cJughead!\u201d Archie calls in the courtyard as he sees Jughead make his way to his motorbike. Jughead stops, turns and waves a hand. Archie jogs up to the Serpent and grins. \u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d Jughead asks as soon as Archie reaches the dark haired boy. \u201cDo you want to meet at Pop\u2019s later?\u201d Archie asks and Jughead is silent for a long moment. As the silence stretches on, Archie can feel his anxiety rise. \u201cSure,\u201d Jughead finally says, and Archie lets out a breath. \u201cMeet at six?\u201d Archie asks and Jughead nods. \u201cSee you then.\u201d  \u00a0  Archie watches Jughead leave and his eyes meet at of Sweet Pea\u2019s, who is standing beside Toni and another Serpent. Sweet Pea\u2019s almond-shaped dark eyes narrow slightly, but Toni hits his arm and he looks away from Archie. Archie can\u2019t help but wish he knew what Sweet Pea was thinking. * * *  \u00a0  \u00a0Archie arrives at Pop\u2019s early and greets the old man at the counter. He sits quietly at a booth and silently waits for Jughead to arrive. When Jughead does arrive, Archie grins. \u201cHope you\u2019re paying.\u201d Jughead says and Archie resigns himself to emptying his wallet. \u201cOf course.\u201d Archie replies, sagely. The night drifts on and Archie\u2019s cheeks hurt from smiling. Jughead is taking a bite of his burger and Archie sips his vanilla milkshake. \u201cBut you still thought about me.\u201d Archie says, his voice teasing. \u201cWhat makes you think I thought about you?\u201d Jughead asks, attempting to sound serious. \u201cYour beanie,\u201d Archie replies, nodding to said clothing. \u201cI gave you that for your eleventh birthday. You still wear it.\u201d  \u00a0  \u201cIt covers up my bed hair.\u201d Jughead defends himself. Archie laughs. \u201cYou always had atrocious bed hair,\u201d Archie says and remembers the sleepovers he and Jughead had as children. \u201cI missed this.\u201d Archie says quietly and Jughead looks at him. It is silent for a moment and then Jughead speaks. \u201cYeah, me too.\u201d The Serpent says softly. \t4. four  During a lunch break, Betty finds herself at the Blue and Gold attempting to come up with an article to write about. It has been a week since the Serpents arrived at Riverdale High and still, it feels like there is a wall between the Serpents and the other students. There isn\u2019t much Betty can do since she isn\u2019t friends with any of the Serpents. She wants to help, but she doesn\u2019t know how. Since Jughead Jones\u2019 arrival at the school, her best friend, Archie, has been jumping between her and Jughead. Betty knows that he is trying to find balance in his life, between football and music, and Betty and Jughead. She wishes he didn\u2019t have to. A knock on the door causes Betty to look up and she is pleasantly surprised to see Jughead standing in the doorway. \u201cHi, Jughead.\u201d Betty says, smiling. \u201cHey.\u201d He replies and looks around the room. \u201cThis is the school newspaper?\u201d Jughead asks and she nods. \u201cYep,\u201d Betty says. \u201cThe Blue and Gold.\u201d  \u00a0  Jughead stops and picks up a photograph. She wonders what is running through his head. \u201cArchie said you might need some help.\u201d He finally utters. She is surprised but amused. Hinting that Betty needs help at the newspaper is something Archie would do, especially if it meant his friends could bond. \u201cI do, actually.\u201d Betty says", "7th page:\n\nHe is extraordinary when he smiles. \u201cI wrote for the Red and Black. It was Southside High\u2019s newspaper.\u201d Is Jughead\u2019s reply. \u201cOh!\u201d Betty says excitedly. \u201cWell, I would love to have you on board.\u201d  \u00a0  \u201cI do have some questions.\u201d Jughead interrupts and Betty nods. \u201cWould I get complete freedom?\u201d  \u00a0  \u201cI\u2019ll help,\u201d Betty says, smiling sheepishly. \u201cAnd edit\u2026 And suggest.\u201d  \u00a0  Jughead looks dubious and Betty can feel herself panicking. \u201cBut it\u2019s your story,\u201d She says quickly. \u201cIt\u2019s your voice.\u201d  \u00a0  \u201cDoesn\u2019t sound like complete freedom,\u201d Jughead muses but he is smiling slightly. \u201cI\u2019m in.\u201d  \u00a0  \u201cOkay!\u201d Betty bursts out and beams at the dark haired Serpent. \u201cGreat!\u201d  \u00a0  The blonde and brunette look at each other from across the room, and suddenly realizing that she\u2019s staring, Betty looks away blushing. Jughead shakes his head and sits down, pulling his computer out of his bag. * * *  \u00a0  \u201cCheryl!\u201d Archie calls as he sees Cheryl in biology class. She looks disinterested in the topics around her but brightens slightly when she sees Archie. \u201cHello, Archie.\u201d Cheryl says and dismisses her minions. Archie sits beside Cheryl and takes a deep breath, attempting to build up his courage. \u201cI was wondering if I could ask you a favour.\u201d He says and Cheryl definitely looks interested now. \u201cA favour?\u201d Cheryl asks. \u201cFrom me?\u201d  \u00a0  Archie already feels regret at his decision but plows on, nonetheless. \u201cCould you let someone onto the cheer squad for me?\u201d Archie asks and nearly flinches at the glare Cheryl sends his way. \u201cExcuse me?\u201d Cheryl asks, coldly. \u201cUh, yeah. I have this friend, Toni, and although she doesn\u2019t say it, she wants to be on the cheer squad.\u201d Archie says and sighs as he lets his words fall. Cheryl raises an eyebrow at him and purses her red lips. \u201cI don\u2019t know\u2026\u201d Cheryl says and Archie comes close to begging her. \u201cFine, but she\u2019ll have to try out.\u201d  \u00a0  \u201cThank you, Cheryl!\u201d Archie smiles and Cheryl\u2019s cold exterior softens slightly. \u201cRemember,\u201d Cheryl says as the teacher begins class. \u201cYou owe me.\u201d  \u00a0  Archie has a feeling he might just regret his actions. * * *  \u00a0  As the day ends and the night turns to black, a mystery rolls into town. This mystery goes by the name of Veronica Lodge. Raven-haired Veronica climbs out of the car, and looks up at the Pembrooke\u2019s ornate fa\u00e7ade. \u201cThe gargoyles remind of the Dakota.\u201d Veronica says. \u201cThe same architect did this one, the Pembrooke. The apartments small but-\u201c Hermione says. \u201cQuality always,\u201d Mother and daughter finish together. Hermione takes ahold of Veronica\u2019s hand. \u201cYou\u2019ll make a go of it here, won\u2019t you? The people in Riverdale, they\u2019re kind and forgiving in a way they just _aren\u2019t_ in New York.\u201d  \u00a0  Veronica looks at her mother\u2019s kind and beautiful face. Her heart bleeds for the pain that her mother has been through. \u201cI\u2019ll try, mum. I promise.\u201d  \u00a0  Veronica takes a deep breath and holds her head high. She is a Lodge, she is strong and like her mother, she will endure. \t5. five  The luminescent lights shine over Pop\u2019s and Archie listens as Betty discusses ideas for her article. Archie looks away and sees Jughead, in his own booth, which is situated at the other end of the diner. Archie sends Jughead a quick wave, to which the Serpent returns. Since coming to Riverdale High, Jughead has spent more time at Pop\u2019s and although the other Serpents never come with him, Jughead seems content. Suddenly, the bell above Pop\u2019s front door jingles. Archie watches in awe as a raven haired beauty enters the diner. She removes the hood of her cloak and makes eye contact with Archie briefly, though to Archie, it feels much longer. The girl breaks eye contact and makes her way to Pop Tate, who is positioned behind the counter. \u201cHi, I called in an order? For Lodge?\u201d  \u00a0  \u201cYes,\u201d Pop replies", "8th page:\n\n\u201cHi.\u201d The girl says and Archie can feel his heart begin to race. \u201cHow are the onion rings here?\u201d  \u00a0  \u201cGreat!\u201d Archie says quickly. He is aware of Betty staring at him weirdly. \u201cThey\u2019re good.\u201d  \u00a0  The girl nods and turns back to Pop in order to ask for onion rings. \u201cThanks.\u201d The girl says to Archie. \u201cMy mum and I just moved here, so\u2026\u201d  \u00a0  \u201cFrom where?\u201d Archie asks, curious. \u201cNew York.\u201d She replies. \u201cDo you guys go to Riverdale?\u201d  \u00a0  \u201cWe do,\u201d Betty tells the girl, smiling kindly. \u201cWe\u2019re sophomores,\u201d Archie pipes in, not taking his eyes off of the beautiful teenager. \u201cMe, too. I\u2019m filled with dread.\u201d She says. \u201cHow come?\u201d Archie asks her. \u201cAre you familiar with Truman Capote\u2019s oeuvre? I\u2019m \u201cBreakfast at Tiffany\u2019s,\u201d but this town is strictly \u201cIn Cold Blood.\u201d\"  \u00a0  Betty and Archie exchange a look of confusion, not understanding the metaphors. The girl offers Archie a hand, and he takes it. \u201cVeronica Lodge,\u201d She says and Archie smiles. \u201cArchie Andrews,\u201d He declares. \u201cAnd this is Betty Cooper.\u201d  \u00a0  \u201cWait,\u201d Veronica says, looking at Betty. \u201cAre you-?\u201d  \u00a0  \u201c- Supposed to give you a tour tomorrow?\u201d Betty finishes. \u201cYes, I\u2019m your peer mentor.\u201d  \u00a0  \u201cFun.\u201d Veronica states, but Archie has the feeling she doesn\u2019t truly mean it. \u201cDo you want to join us?\u201d Archie asks her, quickly. \u201cMaybe we can un-fill you with dread?\u201d  \u00a0  Archie glances over and sees Jughead\u2019s amused expression at Archie\u2019s stumbling. Betty stares at the redhead and Veronica smiles demurely. \u201cMy mum\u2019s waiting for me. But\u2026 Maybe I\u2019ll see you tomorrow?\u201d Veronica questions and looks between him and Betty, before settling on Archie. Archie nods and Betty smiles politely as Veronica pays for her food and walks out of the diner. Archie catches Betty\u2019s questioning look and he shrugs. But, his thoughts drift to the beautiful Veronica Lodge. * * *  \u00a0  FP Jones watches his son silently as the teenager unleashes his fury. FP understands why his son is furious at the deal made between the Ghoulies and the Serpents, but he wishes Jughead would understand why the deal was made. Their fighting was destroying the Southside and that was not something anyone could afford. The anger Jughead feels comes from the loyalty to the Serpents, and FP knows that Jughead will always put them first. \u201cJughead,\u201d FP says. \u201cI don\u2019t want you doing anything to jeopardize this deal.\u201d  \u00a0  \u201cDon\u2019t worry, dad.\u201d Jughead says sardonically. \u201cI won\u2019t. FP grits his teeth; his son is too predictable but there is a part of FP that hopes Jughead won\u2019t do anything. He wishes he had more faith. * * *  \u00a0  \u201cAre we going to let this slide?\u201d Sweet Pea asks as he leans against a table. Jughead sits throwing a ball into the air and catching it, again. \u201cWhat\u2019s our play, Jones?\u201d Sweet Pea asks again and the teenage Serpents watch Jughead. \u201cI think we should make a deal of our own.\u201d Jughead says lightly. \u201cWhat did you have in mind?\u201d Fangs Fogarty asks. \u201cA race.\u201d Jughead replies nonchalantly. \u201cLoser leaves the Southside.\u201d  \u00a0  \u201cHigh stakes,\u201d Toni remarks. Jughead smiles coldly. They are high stakes, but Jughead doesn\u2019t plan on losing. * * *  \u00a0  \u201cA race?\u201d Archie asks Jughead as they walk to class. \u201cAnd the Ghoulies accepted?\u201d  \u00a0  \u201cStupid of them.\u201d Jughead replies and Archie raises his brow. \u201cAll I need is someone who can fix up a car.\u201d Archie thoughts drift to Betty, whose mechanical skills were amazing. \u201cMake it better.\u201d  \u00a0  \u201cYou could ask Betty?\u201d Archie suggests and Jughead looks at him. \u201cBetty?\u201d Jughead asks, confirming what he had heard. \u201cYeah, she\u2019s great with cars.\u201d The redhead replies and Jughead appears contemplative. \u201cAlright.\u201d Jughead says, smiling at the thought of Betty", "9th and last page:\n\nOut of the corner of his eye, he sees Betty and Kevin walking with the new girl, Veronica Lodge, the daughter of the man who had Southside High shut down. Disgusted, Jughead looks away and his eyes catch Archie. The red-haired Bulldog was looking at Veronica, but then his gaze wavers and switches to Sweet Pea. Jughead\u2019s sudden laugh causes Archie to look at him in confusion and the Serpent can only shake his head. \u201cYou can\u2019t have both.\u201d Jughead says and leaves Archie to his confusion. \u201cBoth?\u201d Archie calls out. \u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d  \u00a0  Of course, Archie doesn\u2019t know. He\u2019s as clueless as he was when he was a child. It makes Jughead smile.", "Now I will give you 6 options for the beginning of the next chapter. You don't have to comment anything, just read them carefully. Ready?", "Option 1:\n\n\t6. six  _Jughead Jones sits on the steps at the front of Southside High, beside his closest friend, Toni Topaz._  _\u201cWow, Jones,\u201d Toni remarks after reading the first few chapters of his novel. \u201cProps to you. It\u2019s very Lovecraftian.\u201d_  _\u201cWhich I\u2019m sure was the intention.\u201d Toni smiles at Jughead. \u201cI have to ask you: the main character. Where\u2019d you get the inspiration from?\u201d_  _It\u2019s a tough question and opens old wounds that Jughead had sealed up many years ago. He doesn\u2019t want to tell Toni that the character was based off of his old friend, Archie Andrews. When beginning the novel, he had needed characters and although it hadn\u2019t started out that way, Jughead came to realize that many of the attributes his protagonist had, were too similar to Archie\u2019s. But, he shouldn\u2019t be surprised. As a child, Archie had been Jughead\u2019s hero. Like Archie, his main character was loyal, selfless, a force for good._  _\u201cJust some guy I met once.\u201d Is Jughead\u2019s cryptic reply.", "Option 2:\n\n\t6. six  Days after the disastrous drag race, Jughead is still ignoring Archie. With him, the Serpents are either glaring at the redhead, ignoring him or both. The only exception to this is Toni, who still smiles at him when Archie catches her eyes. Another exception is Sweet Pea, who although doesn\u2019t smile, does catch Archie\u2019s eye occasionally. Instead of joining his friends at their usual lunch table, Archie finds himself sitting in the music room and working on lyrics. It\u2019s quiet aside from the scratching of the pen on paper and the strum of a guitar. Although it was his choice, Archie feels impossibly lonely sitting in the music room. \u201c _Every moment, we\u2019re together,\u201d_ Archie hums. \u201c _Is a moment I remember.\u201d_  Archie stops and pens another lyric on the paper. He likes it, although he doesn\u2019t know where it will go in the song. _\u201cMy love, my heart. I wanna share it with you.\u201d_ He sings lightly and smiles.", "Option 3:\n\n\t6. six  As the homecoming dance looms, the girls of Riverdale High stress over their clothes, makeup and dates. On the opposite end, the majority of boys could not care less about the dance. After cheer practice, Veronica makes her way to the football field in order to ask Archie to the dance. She can only hope that snake from the wrong side of the tracks hasn\u2019t beasix her to it. Somehow, she doubts it. \u201cArchiekins!\u201d Veronica calls and the redhead waves a hand, before jogging over to her. Veronica can\u2019t help but admire his form, despite the fact that he was sweating and dirt covered him. \u201cHi, Ronnie,\u201d Archie greets smiling. \u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d  \u00a0  \u201cI was wondering if you would like to be my date for the homecoming dance.\u201d Veronica says as confidently as she could. \u201cOh,\u201d Archie replies, scrunching his brow and looking at the ground for a long moment. \u201cUh, sure, Ronnie.\u201d  \u00a0  \u201cGreat!\u201d Veronica replies and kisses his cheek quickly. \u201cI\u2019ll be wearing black.", "Option 4:\n\n\t6. six  Betty leans over the hood of the car, dressed in overalls as she works on the car for the race. She doesn\u2019t particularly know what the race is about, but she intends to find out. She only knows the few things that Archie had told her. \u201cWhat is this race even about?\u201d Betty asks Jughead, who is leaning again the black car. \u201cTerritory thing.\u201d Jughead replies. \u201cThe Ghoulies are attempting to take over the Southside and the Serpents.\u201d  \u00a0  \u201cI made a deal with them.\u201d Jughead continues. \u201cWe race and whoever loses, has to leave Riverdale. No questions.\u201d  \u00a0  \u201cBut, why?\u201d Betty asks, confused over the upcoming drag race. Jughead is quiet, obviously debating on whether he should tell the Cooper girl. \u201cMy Serpents have been fighting with the Ghoulies for years.\u201d Jughead admits. \u201cI can\u2019t let this happen, anymore. So, I made a deal with them.

Students turn to watch him, some curious, others judgemental. Archie supposes it isn't surprising since he left Veronica at the dance in favour of Sweet Pea, that, and he ended up leaving Cheryl's after party early with Sweet Pea. They had ended up walking through Riverdale and talking about nothing in particular, but Archie loved every moment of it. He hadn't spoken to Veronica since the dance, though he had tried to ring her multiple times, to no avail. Archie felt guilty every time he remembered the betrayal written cleanly across Ronnie's face. Yet, he couldn't find it in himself to regret what had happened. \"Archie! My bro!\" Reggie interrupts his line of thought by throwing an arm around Archie's shoulder and smirking at the redhaired teenager. \"What's been happening?\" He asks and Archie knows he is referring to himself and Sweet Pea.", "Option 6:\n\n\t6. six  Every so often, Betty will glance at Jughead as he types up a new article for the Blue and Gold.

She stands and walks to the centre of the Blue and Gold, and turns to Jughead. \u201cI think you should talk to Archie.\u201d Betty begins and Jughead\u2019s response is to scoff. \u201cI don\u2019t understand why you\u2019re so mad.\u201d  \u00a0  \u201cYou don\u2019t understand?\u201d Jughead asks, critical and he narrows his blue eyes. \u201cBetty, he called the cops.\u201d  \u00a0  \u201cSo?\u201d Betty asks and Jughead sighs. \u201cHow long do you think the Ghoulies are going to stay away?\u201d Jughead questions her.", "Which option do you think is the true next-chapter beginning?\nAnswer with a single-digit number, corresponding to the option number."], "is_question": [false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, true], "waits": [{"tokens": 0, "time": 0, "percentage_finished": 0.0}, {"tokens": 0, "time": 0, "percentage_finished": 0.0}, {"tokens": 0, "time": 0, "percentage_finished": 0.0}, {"tokens": 0, "time": 0, "percentage_finished": 0.0}, {"tokens": 0, "time": 0, "percentage_finished": 0.0}, {"tokens": 0, "time": 0, "percentage_finished": 0.0}, {"tokens": 0, "time": 0, "percentage_finished": 0.0}, {"tokens": 0, "time": 0, "percentage_finished": 0.0}, {"tokens": 0, "time": 0, "percentage_finished": 0.0}, {"tokens": 0, "time": 0, "percentage_finished": 0.0}, {"tokens": 0, "time": 0, "percentage_finished": 0.0}, {"tokens": 0, "time": 0, "percentage_finished": 0.0}, {"tokens": 0, "time": 0, "percentage_finished": 0.0}, {"tokens": 0, "time": 0, "percentage_finished": 0.0}, {"tokens": 0, "time": 0, "percentage_finished": 0.0}, {"tokens": 0, "time": 0, "percentage_finished": 0.0}, {"tokens": 0, "time": 0, "percentage_finished": 0.0}, {"tokens": 0, "time": 0, "percentage_finished": 0.0}], "expected_responses": ["4"], "can_be_interleaved": true, "is_temporal": false, "uses_callback": false}
