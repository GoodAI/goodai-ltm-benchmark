They are vigilant watchers, guardians who act swiftly and decisively against any form of corruption, dark magic, or entities that threaten the peace and safety of Eldoria. Their purpose is not just to combat darkness but to ensure that light does not become blinding and tyrannical, acknowledging that both light and darkness are essential for harmony.\n\nMembers of the Shadowsong Order are selected through rigorous and mysterious criteria, often identified for their unique talents, moral integrity, and potential to understand the deeper truths of the universe. They are trained in secret locations, learning ancient arts and techniques that have been passed down through generations.\n\nThe Shadowsong Order also acts as advisors in times of great need, providing wisdom and guidance to the leaders of Eldoria, though they always remain neutral, never aligning themselves with any political faction or kingdom.

    "Test (2024-03-08 09:09:53.169880): Answer this question about the fictional world: Who governs Eldoria, and how is the realm managed?",
    "Agent (2024-03-08 09:10:34.882038): Eldoria is governed by the Council of Seven, which is composed of the rulers of the seven prominent noble houses in the realm. This council makes decisions on matters of state, oversees the administration of justice, and ensures the welfare of Eldoria's inhabitants. The Council of Seven works in close collaboration with various guilds, orders, and organizations, including the Academy of Arcane Arts and the Shadowsong Order, to maintain peace, prosperity, and the balance of magical forces within Eldoria.\n\nThe realm is managed through a combination of feudal obligations, magical pacts, and alliances between the noble houses and other powerful entities within Eldoria. Each member of the Council of Seven oversees their own domain, but they must also contribute to the defense and well-being of the entire realm. The council meets regularly at the capital city of Valoria to discuss and decide on issues affecting the realm, from external threats to internal disputes.\n\nIn times of great peril, the Council of Seven has the authority to summon the Eldoria Assembly, a larger gathering that includes representatives from all corners of the realm, including lesser noble families, guild masters, prominent mages, and leaders of significant factions. The Assembly provides a platform for a broader range of voices to be heard and plays a crucial role in uniting Eldoria against common threats.\n\nThe governance of Eldoria is thus a balance of power, wisdom, and magical strength, with the Council of Seven at its core, ensuring the realm remains a place of harmony and prosperity.",
