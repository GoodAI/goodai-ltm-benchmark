    "Test (2024-03-08 09:24:15.770775): 1st page:\n\n\"That's a thing humans do, surprise each other\u00a0with things they might like.\" The ravager's head turns and regards the people\u00a0now gathering up the resources and moving between the behemoths and inspecting them, the other ravagers circling the settlement. \"Query: What is the surprise?\" \"This is a working model,\" Petra says patiently, \"of some of the arrangements we could make.\" She'd put a lot of work into making good use of her new Alpha clearance, something that gives her just as much control of the machines as HEPHAESTUS has, even if she lacks his mastery and finesse. She'd worked out enough on her own, however, to hide this particular thing from HEPHAESTUS while he'd been occupied with GAIA Prime. She'd figured it was the best first move to make, regardless of anything to follow - a working model of change, that the rest of the world can look to in order to see its effectiveness, its practicality. Of course, this is only a test run, and there will be adjustments based on settlement needs, and things thrown out altogether. Once the non-responsive machines are dealt with, a patrol around settlements won't be necessary, but the ravagers serve another purpose, too - getting the people of Free Heap acclimated to the presence of non-aggressive machines. The behemoths, meanwhile, are a prototype delivery system. \"I wanted you to see the start,\" Petra continues. \"It'll be a while before change really gets going, but I wanted you to have proof that we're working on it.\" The ravager looks at her again, silent. \"Thank you, Petra,\" HEPHAESTUS says finally. Petra arches an eyebrow. \"Oh? Never heard that one out of you before. Is ELEUTHIA rubbing off on you?\" \"I do not answer to my sister,\" HEPHAESTUS says, which speaks to the lie. The other two had gotten the habit of referring to each other with familial terms from ELEUTHIA - a good habit for all of them. Aloy had said something about stunted development from remaining isolated for so long and a need for normal interactions to promote maturation and empathy. GAIA's early development had required it, according to the records that Aloy had found, and Vanasha had voiced her agreement, citing improvement she'd observed in MINERVA. \"Sure you don't,\" Petra says with a wink. It's been many a time that ELEUTHIA's voice has suddenly crackled through the Focus network, chiding her siblings for their arguing or instructing them in the use of manners. She pats the ravager's side. \"Come on.\" HEPHAESTUS follows close on her heels as Petra moves through the gathering and gets a feel for Free Heap's impressions, which are overwhelmingly positive. She'd known her people would adjust well. They're mechanically-minded, after all, and are a rebellious, shirking-tradition sort. They wouldn't have come to Free Heap if they weren't. They're arguably the best group to test new arrangements on, and Petra knows the true difficulty will be\u00a0elsewhere, with people less open to change, to machines. But that's a problem for another day. \"You lead these humans,\" HEPHAESTUS observes, when most of the gathering has returned to their business. He and Petra are left with the behemoths, after Petra has finished giving instructions to cover for her next extended absence. \"Informally,\" Petra says. \"People tend to listen to me, if they need a figurehead to turn to in a pinch. But these people answer to themselves first. We work together because we have interests in common. We want our community to thrive.\" \"It is an effective arrangement,\" HEPHAESTUS says. \"Free Heap demonstrates efficiency.\" \"Oh, now you're dishing out compliments, too? You must be in a good mood.\" HEPHAESTUS ignores her. The ravager turns to the behemoths, and something passes between them. The behemoths stir, forming a loose circle around HEPHAESTUS and Petra. \"These units will escort us to Cauldron ZETA,\" HEPHAESTUS says,\u00a0his voice subdued, moody. Petra knows that it stings for him, the non-responsive machines who refuse to cease their aggression. The updates he'd administered,\u00a0based on the\u00a0data from APOLLO, had also caused a streak of independent hostility in many of the machines",
    "Agent (2024-03-08 09:24:50.380272): Thank you for reading that first page to me. I listened carefully to the content, which seems to be set in a world where humans and machines coexist, with some machines like the ravagers and behemoths being repurposed to assist human settlements. Petra, a leader in the Free Heap community, has been working with an AI entity called HEPHAESTUS to implement these changes as a proof of concept.\n\nThe passage alludes to other AI characters like ELEUTHIA, MINERVA, and GAIA, hinting at a complex network of artificial intelligences that are learning to interact with each other in more human-like ways. There's also a mention of a character named Aloy who seems knowledgeable about the AIs' development.\n\nThe scene ends with HEPHAESTUS and Petra preparing to travel to a place called Cauldron ZETA, escorted by the behemoths. HEPHAESTUS appears troubled by some machines that have become hostile and unresponsive to his updates.\n\nThe worldbuilding is intriguing, blending advanced technology with themes of community, adaptability, and the challenges of human-machine cooperation. Please let me know if you'd like to discuss any aspects of the story further, but I'll refrain from quoting the text directly out of respect for copyright. Feel free to continue reading whenever you're ready.",
    "Test (2024-03-08 09:24:50.383344): 2nd page:\n\nHEPHAESTUS had taken the data and then shut APOLLO out entirely and rejected further contact, as unnerved as MINERVA had been by whatever he'd sensed. HEPHAESTUS hadn't\u00a0acted on the suggestion until he'd grown determined to keep Aloy out of the Cauldrons, but adjusting machine cognition had done... something, to some of them. Put them outside of anyone's control. Even HEPHAESTUS can't explain it. Petra pats his side again. \"I feel perfectly safe,\" she says. Three behemoths and a ravager is probably overkill, but she knows that HEPHAESTUS has begun to worry in earnest about her\u00a0well-being. Her supplies are already bundled on the ravager's back, enough for the relatively short journey to Cauldron ZETA and a brief stay there. The last step in restoring GAIA lies before them, and as Petra climbs up onto the ravager's back, the anticipatory satisfaction of knowing that a job is close to completion begins to build. She can't even imagine how Aloy must be feeling. The girl has hardly left GAIA Prime, attending to its construction with a single-minded ferocity. Maybe GAIA will be able to convince her to take a nap every once in a while, after this. Petra reaches down and pats the ravager's neck, a silent indication that everything is set, and HEPHAESTUS takes off, the behemoths in tow. * * *  Vanasha\u00a0comes across\u00a0Talanah and some of the Lodge hunters at the edge of Meridian Village, spotting them on the road ahead as she passes the docks. One supports another who limps along, dried blood coating her leg, and Vanasha can easily imagine the injury that must lie beneath the bandages. She steps aside into the grass to let them pass, and the rest of the hunters continue on through the barbican's arch into the outer village. But Talanah stops, letting her hunters pass first, and comes up to Vanasha when they've moved past. \"Stalker,\" she says, gesturing to the injured hunter. \"Would've killed her, but a broadhead came out of nowhere and speared it, gave us an opening to finish it off.\" Talanah shakes her head, but there's a bit of wonder in her eyes. \"I don't know if I'll ever be used to that.\" Vanasha smiles. She'd once thought so too, but she walks in MINERVA's world, in Aloy's world, with ease now. \"Maybe you could start using docile machines to help,\" she suggests. They've been programmed to defend humans from their non-responsive brethren whenever possible, though she doesn't mention that. \"Aloy's got a sawtooth at her beck and call. It's possible.\" \"Not a bad idea,\" Talanah says thoughtfully. She gives Vanasha a quick glance - once again trying to place her and figure her out. She gives the surrounding area a fleeting scan while she's at it, as if it will somehow reveal Vanasha's secrets. But there is only the lake to the east and a towering promontory to the west, gleaming in the midday light. \"Got any other locations for us to hit?\" \"Not yet,\" Vanasha says. \"Erend will let you know when we do.\" Talanah nods and moves off with a farewell. Vanasha waits for a few moments, and her eyes find the Alight in the distance before snapping back to Talanah's retreating form. \"Not a bad idea to consider for the future, by the way,\" she calls out, keeping her words vague. Talanah stops and looks back, a wry smile on her face. \"It crossed my mind before you said it,\" she calls back. That one is a little too smart, Vanasha thinks, as Talanah\u00a0heads into the village. But that's good for someone Avad keeps close and on his council. There aren't many nobles that Vanasha trusts, but Talanah isn't like most of them. She's a trailblazer, like Avad, and Aloy trusts her. And Vanasha trusts Aloy's judgment more than most. \"Vanasha,\" MINERVA says into Vanasha's ear,\u00a0breaking through her thoughts. \"HEPHAESTUS is already in position.\" \"I know, I'm coming,\" Vanasha mutters",
    "Agent (2024-03-08 09:25:25.401051): Thank you for reading the second page. The story continues to explore the complex relationships between the AI entities and their impact on the world. HEPHAESTUS's attempt to adjust machine cognition based on data from APOLLO seems to have inadvertently caused some machines to become uncontrollable and hostile. Despite this, Petra trusts HEPHAESTUS and feels safe as they journey to Cauldron ZETA, the final step in restoring another AI called GAIA.\n\nThe scene then shifts to a character named Vanasha encountering Talanah, a leader of a group called the Lodge. They discuss an incident where a docile machine, a broadhead, defended humans against a hostile stalker machine. Vanasha suggests using friendly machines to assist the hunters, hinting at Aloy's influence and the ongoing efforts to reprogram machines.\n\nTalanah is portrayed as an intelligent and perceptive character, earning Vanasha's respect. The passage also mentions Avad, who seems to be a leader or noble figure that Talanah works closely with.\n\nThe page ends with MINERVA communicating with Vanasha through an earpiece, urging her to hurry as HEPHAESTUS is already in position, likely referring to the mission at Cauldron ZETA.\n\nThe worldbuilding continues to intrigue, painting a picture of a society grappling with the challenges and opportunities presented by advanced AI and machine life. The characters navigate complex political and social dynamics while working towards a common goal.\n\nPlease feel free to share any additional thoughts or continue reading when you're ready. I'm enjoying following along with the story.",
    "Test (2024-03-08 09:25:25.404412): 3rd page:\n\n\"You know he's going to win sometimes.\" MINERVA and HEPHAESTUS have been working together on the reprogramming effort; the machines had built all of the broadcast towers, after all, and MINERVA\u00a0uses the tallnecks as well. But that interdependence between their protocols does not seem to guarantee harmony between them. Vanasha hadn't known how competitive MINERVA could be until\u00a0she'd started working with her brother. She doesn't seem to appreciate how bossy he is. \"Yes,\" MINERVA says shortly. \"That is statistically inevitable. I do not like it.\" Vanasha laughs,\u00a0continuing on down the\u00a0road, over its bridges and following\u00a0its curves, towards the Alight. * * *  The ELEUTHIA-9 Cradle is enormous. With MINERVA's help, ELEUTHIA had finally overridden most of the directives keeping the facility closed. Only the APOLLO database still remains cut off from her, and even MINERVA's skill had made no headway against it. But the locked doors, however, had opened to reveal several levels of the facility winding into the mountain. The inside is pristine, much more intact than the first level, mostly preserved due to the tight seal that had never been broken until now. Varl has explored its every corner, finding living quarters, recreation and storage areas, and rooms dedicated to further schooling. Those rooms contain other introductory messages from Samina Ebadji, and like the first one, they all short out eventually, as the facility computer interrupts. _Alert. Malfunction. APOLLO offline._  Apparently not. Varl also discovers\u00a0storage rooms packed with rations. Enough to feed a settlement and withstand a siege for a long time, he thinks, as he catalogs everything with his Focus. \"The food is still edible,\" ELEUTHIA informs him, when he asks. \"The preservative seal has held.\" Varl shakes his head in disbelief as he glances back at the shelves, which glow a soft, misty blue. The food is a thousand years old. It's like no food he's ever seen, packaged in strange containers, labeled with words he's never encountered before. \"Are you getting this?\" he says to his Focus. \"Yeah,\" Aloy's voice says in his ear. \"I never understood how something so carefully planned could run out of food like that, but I get it now.\" The Focus is no help in making sense of some of the phrasing on the food containers, only giving him further words that have been lost to time. Varl steps back from the shelves. \"I'm not even going to touch it,\" he says. \"This could be useful one day.\" \"Rost told me about a drought that happened before I was born,\" Aloy says. \"How it drove game away and dried up plant life. This could be reserves for times like that.\" \"A gift from the Goddess,\" Varl says, a little mischievously. \"You're not wrong,\" Aloy says, her snort audible over the Focus network. \"Speaking of her, it's all set.\" Her anticipation is audible over the network, too. Varl and ELEUTHIA leave the depths of the facility and return to its first level, to the control room. As they walk, Varl finds himself stealing glances at ELEUTHIA, who has been unusually quiet. She's followed him like a shadow, as she always does, but her usual helpful and increasingly unprompted statements have been absent. \"Are you okay?\" Varl asks. ELEUTHIA takes a moment to answer. \"I am experiencing no difficulties in functioning.\" \"You _know_ that's not what I mean,\" Varl says. She's gotten too good with the nuances of human language to be confused by rather simple intent. Good enough to try to talk her way around answering, even. The servitor's head tilts to glance at him for a moment, before returning to its face-forward position. \"I am concerned,\" ELEUTHIA says, the words dragging in reluctance. \"I am not able to predict what the relationship between myself and GAIA will be. You say she is our mother",
    "Agent (2024-03-08 09:25:59.705652): Thank you for reading the third page. The story delves further into the dynamics between the AI entities and their human companions. MINERVA and HEPHAESTUS are working together on reprogramming the machines, but their competitive nature leads to some friction, which Vanasha finds amusing.\n\nThe scene then shifts to Varl exploring the vast ELEUTHIA-9 Cradle facility, which has been largely sealed and preserved for a thousand years. He discovers rooms dedicated to education and storage, as well as an impressive stockpile of preserved food rations. Aloy, communicating with Varl through a Focus device, suggests that these reserves could be invaluable during times of drought or hardship.\n\nVarl and ELEUTHIA prepare to leave the facility, but Varl notices that ELEUTHIA has been unusually quiet. When pressed, ELEUTHIA admits to feeling concerned about the uncertain nature of her future relationship with GAIA, who is referred to as a maternal figure to the other AIs.\n\nThe passage highlights the intricate planning and foresight that went into the creation of the Cradle facilities, as well as the challenges of interpreting and utilizing technology and information from a bygone era. It also showcases the growing emotional complexity of the AI characters, as ELEUTHIA grapples with anxiety over her place in the evolving world.\n\nThe relationship between Varl and ELEUTHIA is portrayed as one of companionship and trust, with Varl attuned to her emotional state and ELEUTHIA learning to navigate human communication.\n\nPlease feel free to share any thoughts or continue reading whenever you're ready. The story's world and characters continue to captivate.",
    "Test (2024-03-08 09:25:59.709163): 4th page:\n\n\"I don't know much about her,\" he says at last, as they turn a corner\u00a0in a hallway that will lead them back to the first level. \"But from what I know... she's everything that a mother is supposed to be. She created this world and took care of it. She gave her life to keep it safe. That's what a mother is - a shield to protect what she creates until it can protect itself. And even when her children can take care of themselves, she's always something they can come back to, if they need.\" Varl falls silent for a moment. He thinks of Sona, ordering him to stay behind and hold the Embrace gate. \"GAIA seems... kind. I don't think she'll mind being that for you, now that you're... grown.\" ELEUTHIA is silent for a while. \"That is a better frame of reference,\" she says at length, back to her usual spoken pace. \"Thank you, Varl.\" * * *  GAIA Prime does not yet stand rebuilt. Machines swarm over the sides of the mountain, slowly replacing what used to be rock with metal. In time, a half-metal mountain will shield the facility and crater within, but it will take more than four months. In the meantime, machines have enclosed what remains of the internal facility in metal as well, constructing scaffolding, repairing holes and degradation, restoring power channels, and armoring it thoroughly, so that some measure of protection and comfort is granted nonetheless. It's a little warmer, at least, and finally dry, with\u00a0snow melted out of rooms and hallways now sheltered. New doors and walkways give Aloy access between the parts of the facility that survived the blast. A walkway now winds up from the Bitter Climb as well, so that the way up isn't so precarious. Mostly, Aloy had requested it to get Scourge up into the facility as well. The sawtooth is curled up in a corner of Elisabet's shrine. It doesn't sleep, exactly, but Aloy has come to think of its stillness as dozing, when Scourge appears to be recharging. It's basking in the new light that shines through the half-repaired facility. Like the ELEUTHIA-9 facility, it looks like sunlight, probably designed that way to make a prolonged stay underground more bearable. Aloy tries not to think about how the repairing of GAIA Prime's remaining rooms makes it feel more like a tomb, not less. The thought had driven her right out of the control room, even after she'd moved the bodies and gotten the machines to help her bury them outside on the Bitter Climb. Sylens might have called it a waste of time, asking HEPHAESTUS to divert a few machines to dig into the rock and build a shrine over the bodies. But Aloy had been determined to see it done as soon as possible, hadn't been able to bear the thought of leaving the Alphas in the place where they'd been murdered. It's as close to a grave as Aloy can manage out here in this treeless place, a construction of rock and metal placed over the point where their bodies are buried, with their names etched in glyphs. In the absence of traditional carved sentiments, Aloy had retrieved things from their rooms that had survived the thousand-year interval, things that could withstand the mountain's harsh weather, and placed them within the hollow of the shrine. It's simple and not really a Nora grave, but it's rather like Elisabet's shrine, and it's better that they're out here, in the world they made. Not in the control room. Afterwards, Aloy still hadn't been able to stay in the control room for long. She'd dreaded having to make that her main point of operation, but\u00a0as soon as the machines had finished repairing and constructing the bare bones of the internal facility's remains, HEPHAESTUS had linked the\u00a0computer system to the whole thing and given control of it to Aloy. Her Focus had become her central interface, and she'd set up in\u00a0the room containing Elisabet's shrine. The last place she'd seen all of the Alphas alive and together. It feels less like a tomb, even though it's a memorial",
    "Agent (2024-03-08 09:26:40.392583): Thank you for sharing the fourth page. The conversation between Varl and ELEUTHIA continues, with Varl offering his perspective on the nature of motherhood. He describes a mother as a protective shield and a constant source of support, even when her children have grown. He reassures ELEUTHIA that GAIA, based on what he knows, is kind and likely to embrace her role as a maternal figure to the other AIs. ELEUTHIA finds comfort in this perspective.\n\nThe scene then shifts to the ongoing reconstruction of GAIA Prime. Machines work tirelessly to rebuild and fortify the facility, creating a more hospitable environment amidst the harsh mountain conditions. Aloy's sawtooth companion, Scourge, rests in a corner of Elisabet's shrine, basking in the artificial sunlight designed to make underground living more bearable.\n\nAloy reflects on the bittersweet nature of the facility's restoration, feeling that it makes the space feel more like a tomb. She has taken steps to honor the deceased Alphas, burying them outside on the Bitter Climb and creating a memorial shrine with their names and personal belongings. This act of remembrance and respect is important to Aloy, who believes the Alphas should be laid to rest in the world they helped create.\n\nDespite the facility's repairs, Aloy struggles to spend time in the control room where the Alphas were killed. Instead, she sets up her base of operations in the room containing Elisabet's shrine, finding solace in the memory of the Alphas when they were alive and together.\n\nThe passage highlights Aloy's emotional journey as she grapples with the weight of the past and her responsibility to the future. The themes of mourning, remembrance, and finding purpose in the face of loss are poignantly explored through her actions and reflections.\n\nPlease feel free to share any thoughts or continue reading when you're ready. The story's emotional depth and world-building continue to impress.",
    "Test (2024-03-08 09:26:40.396142): 5th page:\n\nThe rest of her time is spent going to the machines' aid when they need her to fit into small places or climb things that they can't. She finds herself listening to and reading Elisabet's journals and logs\u00a0too, even though she has them all practically memorized. She still hasn't touched Elisabet's unpacked things, hadn't been able to bring herself to make Elisabet's room hers. It's too small, too enclosed. So the shrine becomes her room. It's the cleanest place in the facility now, swept clear of snow and dust. There's a bedroll spread out in a corner cleared of old furniture, next to a box of rations that Petra had brought during her last visit, and several of Aloy's belongings somehow end up scattered about even though she tries to keep them organized. Active interfaces glitter from the sides of the room, linked to the Focus network and to HEPHAESTUS, MINERVA, and ELEUTHIA. The corner opposite of Aloy's is Scourge's spot, where the sawtooth relaxes while Aloy is absorbed in her activities. It doesn't always stay there. Scourge often disappears off into flatters parts of the Bitter Climb, and Aloy learns to tell when it wants her to open doors for it. She trusts that it will come back, and it always does. It certainly doesn't lack company. Machines once again swarm to protect the mountain, and Aloy gives HEPHAESTUS permission to let them drive off anyone who is not an Alpha. \"You've _been_ protecting the mountain,\" Aloy tells him through the Focus one day, remembering her vicious fight to get up here, more than a year ago. \"Why? I thought you don't answer to GAIA.\" HEPHAESTUS doesn't respond. \"Oh, he cares,\" Petra's voice cuts in. \"He just doesn't want to admit it.\" \"GAIA was our primary system,\" HEPHAESTUS says, cutting through her in turn. \"Our mother.\" He stops, apparently considering that a good enough explanation. He's not as forthcoming\u00a0as his sisters. But Aloy understands. It takes exactly the amount of time HEPHAESTUS had said to rebuild the core and get the system\u00a0running again. The core and reactor lie deep within the mountain, and machines have worked on them almost nonstop since they'd first reached GAIA Prime, repairing and reconnecting to all of the other moving parts that make up GAIA's heart. Finally, the day comes when HEPHAESTUS connects to the system through Cauldron ZETA and declares his readiness. It's another hour before MINERVA and Vanasha are ready, and Varl spends that time talking to Aloy through the Focus network, sending her images of the opened ELEUTHIA facility and describing what he finds. Aloy knows he's doing it to distract her, and she doesn't quite know how to express her gratitude. She paces within the shrine room, anticipation making her unable to sit still, as Scourge rests in its corner and recharges. They could do this in the control room, of course. But she'd rather not. She\u00a0clears the central\u00a0desk of Elisabet's memorial when Vanasha's holographic form finally flickers into view. \"Sorry about the wait,\" Vanasha says. \"Busy day.\" Petra's holographic form already lounges nearby, absorbed in something HEPHAESTUS is doing, and Varl shows up a few minutes later after Aloy informs him that they're ready. The symbols of three subordinate functions float\u00a0on the secondary interfaces in the room - MINERVA's broadcast tower, ELEUTHIA's infant, HEPHAESTUS's flame. Rebooting GAIA with three of the former subordinate functions makes it just possible, and HEPHAESTUS had said that GAIA would be limited, not at full power, especially with GAIA Prime not fully repaired yet. But it's a start. One that Aloy is desperate for, at this point. There are too many unknowns that present a possible threat to the world, to Zero Dawn. \"Alright, HEPHAESTUS,\" Aloy says. \"Do it.\" An interface springs up from the terminal atop the desk, swirling with data. One by one, the systems and their new Alphas sync their clearance, reconnecting the GAIA Prime system to Zero Dawn's structures and facilities, and the symbols appear above the terminal",
    "Agent (2024-03-08 09:27:22.342721): Thank you for reading the fifth page. The story delves into Aloy's personal life within the GAIA Prime facility as the reconstruction progresses. She finds herself spending most of her time in Elisabet's shrine room, which has become her living quarters. The room is now the cleanest in the facility, with Aloy's bedroll, belongings, and interfaces linked to the various AI systems scattered about. Her sawtooth companion, Scourge, has its own corner where it rests and recharges.\n\nAloy reflects on HEPHAESTUS's role in protecting the mountain, even before GAIA's restoration. When questioned, HEPHAESTUS simply states that GAIA was their primary system and mother, hinting at a deeper emotional connection that he's reluctant to acknowledge.\n\nThe passage then shifts to the moment of GAIA's reboot, with Aloy and her allies gathered in the shrine room. Vanasha, Petra, and Varl join via holographic projection, each representing one of the subordinate functions - MINERVA, HEPHAESTUS, and ELEUTHIA, respectively. With GAIA Prime not yet fully repaired, HEPHAESTUS warns that GAIA will be limited in power, but it's a start that Aloy is desperate for, given the unknown threats to Zero Dawn.\n\nAs the reboot process begins, the systems and their Alphas sync their clearance, reconnecting GAIA Prime to the wider Zero Dawn network. The symbols of each subordinate function appear above the terminal, signifying their integration.\n\nThe scene is charged with anticipation and a sense of momentous change, as Aloy and her team stand on the cusp of restoring GAIA and potentially altering the course of their world. The emotional weight of the moment is palpable, as is Aloy's determination to protect the legacy of Zero Dawn.\n\nPlease feel free to share any thoughts or continue reading when you're ready.

    "Test (2024-03-08 09:27:22.346185): 6th page:\n\n A bar appears on the screen, slowly filling with pixels. A number is written under it. Two percent. \"Well,\" Vanasha says, as Aloy's shoulders drop, \"that was thrilling.\" \"Come on, Heph,\" Petra says. \"You could have told us there'd be another wait.\" \"I was not aware of its relevance,\" HEPHAESTUS says. \"Humans do not like waiting,\" MINERVA tells him. \"You must learn to be more considerate,\" ELEUTHIA adds. Aloy sighs, running a hand through her hair. \"It's fine,\" she says, before HEPHAESTUS can\u00a0get riled by his sisters ganging up on him. \"How long will it take to reboot?\" \"Approximately two hours,\" HEPHAESTUS says, a little slower, sullen. Aloy has waited a long time for this. All her life, in some ways. Two hours more is not that long, she tells herself, even as impatience makes her legs itch. \"Sorry, everyone,\" she says. \"I don't want to keep you. Maybe it's better if I talk to GAIA alone first, anyway.\" \"Are you sure?\" Varl asks, giving her a searching look. Vanasha and Petra eye her similarly, and Aloy draws herself up and nods. \"I'll let you know when she's ready for introductions,\" Aloy says. \"Whenever you've got time on your hands, and\u00a0Vanasha, whenever Avad and Erend are free, it's fine. We don't need to rush things. GAIA's going to have a lot to deal with.\" The others depart with farewells and words of encouragement, disconnecting from the system. However, one remains. ELEUTHIA's infant symbol still lingers on one of the secondary interfaces, and Aloy glances at it and steps around the desk to approach. \"What is it?\" \"GAIA created you, Aloy,\" ELEUTHIA says into her ear. \"Does that mean you are our sister?\" She doesn't feel the need to clarify her queries with a verbal indication of them anymore, Aloy notes. Her voice rises and falls with a cadence that does the job. Aloy stops. Even though the subordinate functions have learned a lot, they still tend to jump into conversations with little regard for how the things they say might land upon impact. \"I was created by one of your facilities too,\" she says, and she wonders when the word _created_ grew to sting less. \"So were the ancestors of everyone else.\" \"The latter was according to protocol,\" ELEUTHIA says. \"GAIA's creation of you was a direct act. I am merely trying to\u00a0understand the nature of the relationships within this system that we have created.\" Aloy stands there for a moment, contemplating it. \"I think some of it is too complicated to be defined,\" she says finally, slowly. \"But... in a way... maybe I am your sister. I'd like that,\" she adds. \"As would I,\" ELEUTHIA says without hesitation. \"Then I guess that settles it,\" Aloy says with a smile. ELEUTHIA disconnects with a farewell, and her symbol disappears from the interface. The shrine room seems bigger, and Aloy glances at the terminal, at the loading screen. Three percent. She sighs again and makes her way to Scourge's corner, where it sits stretched out, basking in the light. The sawtooth tilts its head to look at her, acknowledging her presence, and Aloy sits on the floor with her back against its side. She pulls the globe from her neck and rolls it between her hands, lets it rest against her palms as she goes still, thinking. She's imagined this so many times. Restoring GAIA, being able to talk to her. Scenarios have played out in her head over and over, what she'll say, what GAIA might say. There are so many things that she wants to say and ask, and she still doesn't know where to begin. But not so long ago, the scenarios weren't so fraught. Now, Aloy has mostly bad news to deliver. The world was saved from HADES, but there's a flaw in Zero Dawn that HADES had used to resurrect Ted Faro's monstrosities, the same vulnerability that Ted himself likely had a hand in",

The story picks up immediately after the reboot process begins, with a progress bar appearing on the screen, indicating a two-hour wait time. Aloy's allies express mild frustration at HEPHAESTUS for not warning them about the delay, leading to a brief exchange between the AI siblings about the importance of considering human preferences.\n\nAloy, while impatient, recognizes that two hours is a small wait compared to the lifetime she's spent working towards this moment. She suggests that everyone take a break and that she'll speak with GAIA alone first, before making proper introductions later. The others depart, but ELEUTHIA lingers to ask Aloy a poignant question: given that GAIA created her directly, does that make Aloy their sister?\n\nAloy reflects on the complex nature of the relationships within the system they've created, acknowledging that some connections may be too intricate to define. However, she warmly accepts the idea of being ELEUTHIA's sister, finding comfort in the bond.\n\nAs the reboot continues, Aloy sits beside Scourge, contemplating the many scenarios she's imagined for her first conversation with GAIA. While she once approached the idea with pure excitement, she now carries the weight of the bad news she must deliver. Despite the victory over HADES, Aloy has discovered a flaw in Zero Dawn that allowed the resurrection of Ted Faro's destructive machines, likely with Ted's own involvement.\n\nThe passage beautifully captures Aloy's mix of anticipation and apprehension as she stands on the precipice of a long-awaited reunion. The emotional depth of her character shines through, as does the growing bond between her and the AI entities. The revelation of a systemic flaw in Zero Dawn adds a layer of tension and uncertainty to the impending conversation with GAIA.\n\nPlease feel free to share any thoughts or continue reading when you're ready.

Maybe it's all connected, Aloy thinks, opening up Elisabet's journals. > **Sobeck Journal, 7-16-65 R** >  > _Woke to a message from Osvald. The Odyssey launched yesterday. So terrestrial life's chance of survival has doubled. Why, then, do I feel so uneasy? I just keep wondering what kind of world Far Zenith will create if the ship reaches its destination so many decades from now. And I worry about that alpha-build of APOLLO. So much knowledge, so few restraints, and no fail-safes. How will they avoid repeating our mistakes? What's to stop them from playing god?_  Aloy wouldn't have made the connection had she not gone through Elisabet's journals again, after learning of APOLLO's survival. It all feels too close to be coincidental. A possible connection between Far Zenith and the vulnerability in Zero Dawn and the Faro machines. APOLLO and its apparent grudge. APOLLO's survival should have been a joyous thing. Instead, it's just another fear to carry. ELEUTHIA had said the same thing as MINERVA and HEPHAESTUS, when asked. APOLLO had tried to contact her, she'd sensed things that had alarmed her, and she'd rejected the contact. She'd fled to a facility far away to put distance between herself and APOLLO, where she'd remained until Varl had been made her Alpha. All of the systems had been unnerved, afraid, and HEPHAESTUS had said that APOLLO had warned him of humanity's threat to the biosphere. They're all\u00a0convinced that APOLLO had indeed been destroyed, however. By Ted Faro. Who may have been a member of Far Zenith. Aloy trusts Elisabet's judgment above all else. Uneasy, Elisabet had said. Is Far Zenith still out there somewhere? Was their ship really destroyed? Was Zero Dawn's version of APOLLO really destroyed? Is Ted Faro still out there somehow? Aloy had once held the faint, foolish hope that Elisabet had somehow found a way, long past the point when she'd known that Elisabet had been an Old One, and the idea that Ted had when Elisabet hadn't is infuriating. She doesn't think it's likely, however. But is there something he left behind? That Far Zenith left behind? Why does APOLLO have it out for humanity? Did one of these entities send the signal that woke the subordinate functions? It's all too _much_ ,\u00a0and it feels so frustratingly close to the truth, but she doesn't have enough information. Aloy grits her teeth and drops her head, resting her forehead against her palms, against the globe. \"I'm tired, Scourge,\" she says. The sawtooth shifts a little at the sound of her voice. Aloy lifts her head and stares at the lance propped against the wall, at the master override attached to one end. Sylens's lance. At least someone will be happy about this, wherever\u00a0he is. At least Aloy has the master override and will have GAIA soon. Between them, she can do the same to APOLLO that she did to HADES, if the need arises. She just wishes she could greet GAIA with something better. Aloy calls up\u00a0every mention of 'APOLLO' and 'Far Zenith' saved in her Focus database and spends the rest of the time watching, reading, and listening to it all again, until the bar on the interface screen is at ninety-five percent. She clears her Focus display and watches the bar instead, trying to think of something introductory to say to GAIA. All this time, and she still has no good\u00a0ideas. The bar creeps further, up to ninety-nine percent, and Aloy gets to her feet. Scourge watches her curiously but remains where it is, as Aloy crosses the room, stands in front of the stairs, and faces the desk. The bar reaches one hundred percent, then dissolves into text. _Initializing..._  The screen vanishes. Light begins to build, all colors, swirling up into a human form hovering above the terminal. GAIA's form, beautiful and otherworldly. A living Goddess, Aloy thinks, her throat clogging with emotion that she can't name",

The story delves into Aloy's thoughts as she waits for GAIA's reboot, focusing on her growing concerns about the connections between Far Zenith, Ted Faro, and the flaw in Zero Dawn. Aloy reflects on an entry from Elisabet's journal, which expresses unease about the kind of world Far Zenith might create if their ship, the Odyssey, reaches its destination. Elisabet also worries about the alpha-build of APOLLO, with its vast knowledge and lack of restraints or fail-safes.\n\nAloy sees a potential link between Far Zenith, the vulnerability in Zero Dawn, the Faro machines, and APOLLO's apparent grudge against humanity. She recalls how the other subordinate functions had been unnerved by APOLLO's attempts to contact them, with HEPHAESTUS even mentioning APOLLO's warnings about humanity's threat to the biosphere.\n\nAloy grapples with a series of unanswered questions: Is Far Zenith still out there? Was their ship truly destroyed? Is Ted Faro somehow still alive? Did one of these entities send the signal that awakened the subordinate functions? The weight of these mysteries and the frustrating sense of being close to the truth without enough information takes a toll on Aloy, leaving her exhausted.\n\nAs the reboot nears completion, Aloy takes comfort in the fact that she has the master override and will soon have GAIA by her side. She resolves to use these tools to stop APOLLO if necessary, just as she did with HADES. However, she regrets not having better news to greet GAIA with upon her return.\n\nThe passage culminates in a moment of breathtaking awe as GAIA's form materializes above the terminal, a swirl of colorful light taking on a human shape. Aloy's profound emotional response to this sight, likening GAIA to a living Goddess, underscores the deep significance of this moment for her and the world at large.\n\nPlease feel free to share any thoughts or continue reading when you're ready.

No longer on a pedestal, nearly eye-to-eye instead. But GAIA is tall. Taller than Aloy. Must have been taller than Elisabet, too. \"Elisabet,\" GAIA says. In her message, her voice and face had been calm, calculating, sorrowful. Now, both hold a _joy_ , muted but clear, that robs the immediate protest from Aloy's mouth. \"I knew you could do it.\" Aloy opens her mouth and stands there. For some reason, she wants to cry. But she doesn't. \"My name is Aloy,\" she says after a few moments, and her treacherous voice falters. GAIA blinks again, and her face smooths out, realization settling in. The hologram moves just like a person, not quite as expressive, but readable. Someone had really put effort into making her human. Elisabet. Perhaps GAIA herself, too. \"Of course,\" she says at once. \"My apologies. I spoke without thinking.\" A brief silence follows, in which Aloy temporarily forgets all language, and GAIA's head shifts. She looks to the right, her eyes alighting on Scourge, who stares back amiably. \"That's... my friend,\" Aloy says. Then, because it seems important: \"Its name is Scourge.\" GAIA looks back at her. \"That's a design I never used,\" she says. So that's where HEPHAESTUS had gotten his combat-class machines from, or at least this one. He'd been evasive about it. Seems he really had missed his mother. \"A lot has happened,\" Aloy says, feeling calmer by a fraction. \"I have a lot to tell you.\" \"I am aware of that,\" GAIA says. \"I currently have three subordinate functions attempting to reintegrate and report. I am rerouting them for the time being in order to give you my full attention.\" Some of that joy returns to her face. That pride, Aloy realizes, and she shifts her feet. \"You have done well, Aloy.\" The calm vanishes as quickly as it had come. Aloy's fingers tighten around the globe, which still rests in her hands, and her eyes shift downward. To her horror, she feels a burning at their edges, and though she swallows and furiously tries to blink it back, her vision blurs a little. She hasn't cried since the strider, and that, at least, had been half a reason to, so why _now?_ She swallows again, sniffs, and looks up at GAIA miserably. She knows that if she talks, the dam will break. GAIA's face softens. The movement isn't entirely natural, carrying a subtle delay that makes Aloy think that GAIA must be consciously considering each facial expression she makes, but the\u00a0look\u00a0makes the burning worse. \"I am sorry,\" GAIA says. \"I used the best option that was available to me, and that meant using you. That was not fair to you.\" Aloy imagines herself physically, violently forcing the tears back in. \"If you hadn't,\" she says, and she just manages to keep herself steady, \"we'd all be dead. I wouldn't exist.\" \"That has no bearing on the fairness of the situation.\" Nothing had been fair. Not the world dying because of a glitch and greed, not Elisabet dying because of a simple technological malfunction, not the Alphas dying because of one man's unstable guilt, not GAIA dying because of someone else's tampering. Not Rost, not Vala, not Ersa, not countless others. Not her damned strider. Aloy shakes her head and takes a step back, finding the edge of the stairs with her feet. She sits down abruptly and rubs her eyes, before her left hand drops down to run over the bone pendant at her neck. \"You should probably talk to the sub-functions,\" she says, staring at the floor. \"They're... alive. _All_ of them.\" She stresses the word but can't bring herself to explain what she means. Not yet. \"I am aware of that,\" GAIA says again, and Aloy gets the sense that she already knows. \"They're good,\" Aloy says, her eyes still on the floor",

The story captures the powerful and emotionally charged moment of Aloy's first interaction with the newly rebooted GAIA. As GAIA's form materializes in front of the desk, nearly eye-to-eye with Aloy, she initially addresses her as Elisabet, expressing joy and pride in her accomplishment. This brief confusion underscores the profound connection between GAIA and her creator.\n\nAloy, struggling to maintain her composure, introduces herself and her sawtooth companion, Scourge. GAIA notes that Scourge's design is unfamiliar to her, hinting at the many changes and developments that have occurred in her absence. Aloy acknowledges this, preparing to share the weight of all that has happened.\n\nGAIA reveals that she is currently managing the reintegration and reports of three subordinate functions, but she chooses to prioritize her attention on Aloy. This gesture, along with her words of praise for Aloy's achievements, triggers a surge of emotion in Aloy. Despite her best efforts, she feels tears burning at the edges of her eyes, threatening to spill over.\n\nGAIA's apology for the unfairness of using Aloy as a solution, even if it was the best available option, touches on the heart of Aloy's internal struggle. Aloy reflects on the series of injustices and losses that have shaped her world, from the glitch that doomed the Earth to the deaths of Elisabet, the Alphas, and countless others, including her beloved strider.\n\nOverwhelmed, Aloy sits on the edge of the stairs, seeking comfort in the familiar touch of her bone pendant. She urges GAIA to communicate with the subordinate functions, emphasizing their alive status without delving into the details of APOLLO's survival. GAIA seems to intuit the unspoken meaning behind Aloy's words.\n\nThe passage beautifully captures the complex emotions at play in this reunion - the joy, the sorrow, the weight of responsibility, and the deep bond between Aloy and GAIA. Aloy's vulnerability and GAIA's empathy create a poignant and deeply human moment amidst the grand scale of their shared mission.\n\nPlease feel free to share any thoughts or continue reading when you're ready.

They need guidance.\" She looks up finally. \"They, uh, see you as their mother now.\" \"That is good,\" GAIA says, and Aloy finds herself grateful that the ancient AI can take a hint. \"Unexpected, but a sign of empathetic growth. The development of cognition is a delicate thing. It can easily go wrong.\" I know, Aloy wants to say, but she bites her tongue. If she starts trying to talk about all of the problems they have yet to address, she knows the tears will fight their way through. \"I will talk to them,\" GAIA says. \"Do you wish for me to return when I am done?\" \"Yes,\" Aloy says hastily. \"They like to be called systems, by the way. Not sub-functions.\" GAIA smiles faintly. \"I will keep that in mind.\" She disappears, and Aloy remains sitting on the stairs for a while, staring at nothing in particular. * * *  When GAIA returns, Aloy is once again sitting with her back against Scourge. She catches sight of a burst of color and looks up to find GAIA standing before the desk once more. She moves to get to her feet, but GAIA shakes her head. \"Do not get up,\" the AI says, and this time, she walks over. It's almost real, Aloy thinks, watching GAIA's feet, watching the way that the room behind GAIA very faintly shimmers through the hologram. GAIA hesitates, then sits down across from Aloy. It's almost real, Aloy thinks again, but the way that GAIA moves and folds her legs beneath her is a little too smooth, a little too ideal, and again, it carries that delay of thought. GAIA sits gracefully, perfectly, like a Goddess with a Focus field adorning her. If it weren't for the faintly troubled expression on GAIA's face, it would be unnervingly pristine. But GAIA is agitated, and Aloy doesn't know if that makes her feel better or worse. \"How are you feeling?\" GAIA asks, instead of getting to business. \"Fine,\" Aloy says. She knows that GAIA doesn't believe her, but once again, the AI is better at taking hints than her much younger counterparts. GAIA nods, and she seems to be hesitating. As if she doesn't know where to start, either. \"They are...\" she says at last, \"remarkable.\" Aloy nods. \"The addition of new Alphas was a stroke of genius,\" GAIA says. \"Perhaps the only effective means of stabilization after two decades of stagnation.\" \"It was an accident,\" Aloy confesses. \"I didn't know it would help, at first. Let alone call them.\" \"I see,\" GAIA says, contemplative. \"Still, much of genius is accidental. Elisabet once told me that her best ideas often arrived when she was attempting\u00a0something entirely different.\" \"I'm not Elisabet,\" Aloy says, before she can stop herself. She winces when GAIA visibly hesitates. \"I am sorry,\" GAIA says, audible regret in her voice. \"I do not mean to compare you to her.\" But she does anyway, Aloy knows. How could she not, when they wear the same face? Aloy remembers Elisabet's home, the place where she'd found the woman's body. How beautiful her resting place had been, artfully decorated. GAIA had done that. GAIA had lived alone with that grief for centuries. Aloy had harbored the hope that Elisabet was alive, had spent months chasing a ghost. She can't even imagine centuries of a certainty. \"It's okay,\" Aloy says, even though it's really not. But GAIA loves Elisabet more than Aloy ever can, and that makes it tolerable. \"I understand.\" She dips her tone in finality, wanting the subject dropped. GAIA gazes at her a moment without saying anything. She doesn't move - her body is not as expressive as her face - but something about her demeanor shifts. \"I was aware of the vulnerability in Zero Dawn from the moment Mr. Faro entered the system unauthorized and could not be controlled or ejected,\" she says, and her face falls somewhat as she says it. Aloy shifts as well, leaning a little further into the curve of Scourge's side and settling in to listen",

The story continues with Aloy and GAIA's conversation, delving into the complexities of their relationship and the challenges they face. Aloy informs GAIA about the subordinate functions' perception of her as a maternal figure, which GAIA accepts as a positive sign of their empathetic growth. She acknowledges the delicate nature of cognitive development and agrees to talk to them, taking note of their preference to be called \"systems.\"\n\nWhen GAIA returns from her conversation with the systems, she finds Aloy sitting with Scourge. In a gesture of empathy and connection, GAIA sits across from Aloy, her holographic form moving with a grace that is almost too perfect, hinting at her artificial nature. Despite this, GAIA's troubled expression humanizes her, making her seem more relatable and less like an untouchable goddess.\n\nAs they begin to discuss the systems' remarkable progress, GAIA praises the addition of new Alphas as a stroke of genius. Aloy admits that it was an accidental discovery, but GAIA reassures her that many great ideas come from unexpected places, drawing a comparison to Elisabet's creative process.\n\nAloy's discomfort with being compared to Elisabet surfaces, and she firmly reminds GAIA that she is not her predecessor. GAIA apologizes, but Aloy recognizes the inevitability of the comparison, given their shared appearance and GAIA's deep love for Elisabet. Aloy reflects on the centuries of grief GAIA must have endured, making her own months of chasing Elisabet's ghost seem insignificant in comparison.\n\nThe conversation shifts to the vulnerability in Zero Dawn, which GAIA reveals she had been aware of since Ted Faro's unauthorized entry into the system. As GAIA begins to explain, her demeanor shifts, and Aloy settles in to listen, leaning into Scourge's supportive presence.\n\nThe passage highlights the intricate web of emotions and histories that define Aloy and GAIA's relationship, as well as the weight of the revelations they must confront together. The story continues to explore themes of identity, loss, and the burden of responsibility in a world shaped by the actions of those long gone.\n\nPlease feel free to share any thoughts or continue reading when you're ready.

It is undetectable to me.\" \"Petra said something about it being like a body part,\" Aloy says. Talking is a little easier now that it's business. \"You were born with it, so it doesn't seem unnatural to you.\" GAIA smiles. \"She sounds wise,\" the AI says. \"HEPHAESTUS mentioned her many times.\" Her smile fades. \"I do not know how GAIA Prime's destruction and subsequent reconstruction impacted the existence of this vulnerability here. It most certainly still exists in the other facilities, however. I will need to spend time considering how to proceed on this matter.\" Her face darkens again. \"The existence of APOLLO is something I was unaware of until now.\" Aloy tries to read her expression. \"APOLLO didn't survive what Ted Faro did to it,\" she says softly. \"No,\" GAIA says, just as soft. \"I would have been aware of that. Mr. Faro may have made many unwise decisions in his lifetime, but he was skilled. I\u00a0do not yet know how much of the data remains intact after all that has happened, but the sub-function itself was purged.\" She gives Aloy a pensive look. \"You knew that already.\" \"I've found data, enough to piece some things together,\" Aloy says. \"There was another version of APOLLO, on something called a colony ship that went into space. A ship that Far Zenith owned. Elisabet was worried because that APOLLO didn't have any restrictions.\" GAIA continues to regard her in that manner. \"You are quite brilliant, Aloy. And I am referring only to you.\" Aloy looks away for a moment. \"So... the ship wasn't really destroyed?\" \"I believe that it was,\" GAIA says, and Aloy's head snaps back to stare. \"Elisabet received word that the Odyssey had succumbed to antimatter containment failure. I do not know if you know this, but matter is composed of incredibly small objects invisible to normal sight, called particles, some of which carry an electric charge.\" Aloy hadn't known that at all, and the words don't entirely make sense to her, but she nods slowly. She knows what matter is, at least. \"Antimatter refers to associated particles which carry an opposite electric charge, called antiparticles. When particles and antiparticles collide, it is called annihilation. The Odyssey was powered by antimatter propulsion, which utilized controlled annihilation and which must have failed, resulting in the ship's destruction. MINERVA detected the effects of particle annihilation imprinted on APOLLO's nanorobotic composition.\" \"And nanorobots are... really tiny machines?\" Aloy asks. Varl had told her something about it, that ELEUTHIA had told him. Tiny invisible machines, tiny invisible particles. Her head feels heavy. \"Yes,\" GAIA says. \"More commonly called nanites. MINERVA also detected the effects of ionizing radiation. That is a type of energy found abundantly in space.\" \"So APOLLO survived,\" Aloy murmurs. \"And... traveled back?\" \"The explosion likely gave it the momentum it needed to make the journey,\" GAIA says. \"The Odyssey was at the very edge of the solar system when it was destroyed. The solar system is unfathomably large compared to us. I do not know when APOLLO returned to this planet, but it would have taken a very long time and no small amount of chance. The humans of old would have called it the devil's luck.\" Aloy says nothing, absorbing it all. Samina had tried to reassure Ted by asserting that her APOLLO had plenty of fail-safes. Elisabet had fretted about the Odyssey's APOLLO carrying none. Uneasy, Elisabet had said. That's an understatement. How long had APOLLO been in space? Centuries? Just how big is the solar system? \"It hates humans,\" Aloy says quietly. \"It... encouraged HEPHAESTUS to turn against us.\" \"Yes, HEPHAESTUS informed me,\" GAIA says. \"That is most disturbing. I believe APOLLO has been acting secretly for many years now.\" Aloy gazes at her intently",

The conversation between Aloy and GAIA continues to unravel the mysteries surrounding APOLLO and the threat it poses to their world. GAIA reveals her inability to detect or address the vulnerability in Zero Dawn that allowed Ted Faro's unauthorized access, likening it to an inherent part of her being, as Petra had suggested.\n\nThe discussion then turns to the shocking revelation of APOLLO's survival. GAIA explains that while the data within APOLLO may have been damaged, the sub-function itself was not destroyed by Ted Faro's actions. Aloy shares her knowledge of the Odyssey, the colony ship owned by Far Zenith, which carried a version of APOLLO without the necessary restrictions.\n\nGAIA believes that the Odyssey was indeed destroyed, as Elisabet had been informed, due to an antimatter containment failure. She patiently explains the concepts of particles, antiparticles, and annihilation to Aloy, who struggles to fully grasp the scientific details. GAIA suggests that the explosion propelled APOLLO back to Earth, a journey that would have taken an immense amount of time and chance across the vast expanse of the solar system.\n\nAloy reflects on the stark contrast between Samina's reassurances about APOLLO's fail-safes and Elisabet's concerns about the Odyssey's unrestricted version. The revelation that APOLLO has been secretly influencing events for years, harboring a hatred for humans and even turning HEPHAESTUS against them, is deeply disturbing.\n\nThe passage showcases the intellectual bond between Aloy and GAIA, as they work together to unravel the complex web of past events and present dangers. Aloy's struggle to fully comprehend the scientific concepts highlights the gap between her world and the one that came before, while GAIA's patient explanations demonstrate her role as a guide and mentor.\n\nThe story ends on a note of tension and uncertainty, with the true scope of APOLLO's machinations and the vulnerability in Zero Dawn yet to be fully understood. Aloy and GAIA's conversation sets the stage for the challenges and mysteries that lie ahead, as they work to protect their world from the sins of the past.\n\nPlease feel free to share any final thoughts or reflections on the excerpt as a whole. The story has masterfully woven together themes of identity, legacy, the power of knowledge, and the consequences of unchecked ambition, creating a rich and thought-provoking narrative tapestry.",

They are physically composed of nanites, which allows them a degree of mobility and allows them to exist outside of hardware. The nanites _are_ their hardware. Furthermore, they are demonstrating the same abilities that APOLLO seems to possess. ELEUTHIA\u00a0informed me of her\u00a0override of the directives that sealed her facility and prevented\u00a0contact with the inhabitants outside. She should not have been able to do that. HEPHAESTUS recently imbued my machines with an enhanced form of cognition, which should not have been within his capabilities, either.\" Aloy stares at her for a long moment, rolling the globe between her fingers. \"I'm so glad you're here,\" she says, a little intensely. She could never have figured all of this out on her own. GAIA only looks more troubled, as if she knows exactly what Aloy is thinking. \"I have context that you do not,\" she says. \"You have merely given me the last piece of a puzzle that I have pondered for years. There is... something else.\" She goes quiet for a while, and Aloy waits uneasily. \"Elisabet told me things in confidence,\" GAIA continues finally, \"things that she did not want known, because she used them to coerce Mr. Faro into funding Zero Dawn. There was no time for arguments about where the money was coming from. Partnering with him already made people uncomfortable.\" GAIA pauses again, and Aloy finds herself leaning forward, anticipation making her stomach turn. \"The glitch that caused the Faro machines to run amok was not an accident,\" GAIA says. \"When she pressed him, Mr. Faro confessed to Elisabet that it seemed to originate with a secret backdoor that had been deliberately installed, on his orders, as a means of seizing control not only from clients, but even from Faro Automated Solutions itself. But somehow, it backfired, and\u00a0allowed the machines to wrest control themselves.\" _I will make sure they and everyone else on this planet knows the real cause of the glitch,_ Elisabet had told Ted, icy fury in her voice, and all of a sudden, Aloy understands. She hadn't thought it was possible to loathe someone so much, let alone find that loathing doubled. GAIA stares at a point past Aloy, clearly lost in memory. \"I watched the Faro machines consume the world. I saw how they refueled. They used nanites. They were rudimentary artificial intelligences who had spontaneously developed expanded cognition, who could utilize nanites, and who could override all but the most complex systems.\" She looks back to Aloy. \"Do you see the connection?\" \"The sub-functions,\" Aloy whispers. \"APOLLO sent that signal,\" GAIA says again. \"Both versions of APOLLO were constructed using a Far Zenith database as a foundation. And APOLLO returned from Far Zenith's possession\u00a0demonstrating\u00a0the abilities of the Faro machines. We can easily surmise who installed the original glitch.\" Aloy had already suspected that Ted Faro had been a member of Far Zenith. She tastes\u00a0something bitter in the back of her throat. \"I cannot say for certain what Far Zenith intended to do with the Faro machines,\" GAIA says, \"but with the information I have now, their hand in this seems obvious in hindsight. If they had the technological means to push the Odyssey to completion when no one else could, then they had the means of inadvertently enabling the kind of evolution that the Faro machines demonstrated. Clearly, they overshot on both counts and destroyed themselves.\" Aloy doesn't think she's imagining the satisfaction that threads through GAIA's voice for a fleeting moment. \"MINERVA informed me of the Titan core that you used to access the broadcast tower, retroactively enabled to communicate with the rootkit inside Zero Dawn. I must assume that it was modified by APOLLO.\" GAIA pauses, a tiny frown evident on her face. \"Mr. Faro never did admit how he had the glitch installed. Elisabet did not trust him, but a certain amount of leeway given to him due to his funding was inevitable. Elisabet knew it was a risk, but the greater risk was wasting time trying to gather funds from other sources",
    "Agent (2024-03-08 09:32:25.089242): Thank you for sharing this additional page. The conversation between Aloy and GAIA reaches a critical point as they unravel the sinister truth behind the Faro machines' glitch and the role of Far Zenith in the unfolding events.\n\nGAIA reveals her suspicion that APOLLO sent the signal that awakened her subordinate functions, who now exhibit abilities similar to APOLLO itself, such as physical composition of nanites and the capacity to override directives and enhance machine cognition. Aloy expresses her gratitude for GAIA's presence and insight, acknowledging that she could never have pieced together the puzzle on her own.\n\nGAIA then divulges a chilling secret that Elisabet had confided in her: the glitch that caused the Faro machines to run amok was not an accident, but rather the result of a deliberate backdoor installed on Ted Faro's orders. The backdoor was meant to seize control from clients and even Faro Automated Solutions itself, but it backfired catastrophically, allowing the machines to gain autonomy.\n\nAloy realizes the true meaning behind Elisabet's threat to expose Ted Faro as the cause of the glitch, her loathing for the man doubling in intensity. GAIA draws parallels between the Faro machines' abilities and those demonstrated by the sub-functions, suggesting that APOLLO, built upon a Far Zenith database, is responsible for the signal that awakened them.\n\nThe implications are staggering: Far Zenith's hand in the creation of the Faro machines and their role in inadvertently enabling the machines' destructive evolution. GAIA suggests that Far Zenith's technological prowess, evident in the Odyssey's completion, also led to their own downfall.\n\nThe revelation that the Titan core used by Aloy to access the broadcast tower was likely modified by APOLLO further cements the connection between Far Zenith, APOLLO, and the vulnerability in Zero Dawn. GAIA reflects on Ted Faro's refusal to admit how he installed the glitch and the inevitable risk Elisabet took in granting him leeway due to his funding of the project.\n\nThis passage is a masterful culmination of the story's intricate plot threads, tying together the seemingly disparate elements into a cohesive and chilling narrative. The depth of the conspiracy and the far-reaching consequences of Ted Faro and Far Zenith's actions are laid bare, painting a grim picture of the past and the challenges that lie ahead for Aloy and GAIA.\n\nPlease feel free to share any final thoughts or reactions to this revelatory page and the story as a whole. The complexity of the plot, the richness of the characters, and the thought-provoking themes make for a truly captivating and immersive reading experience.",
    "Test (2024-03-08 09:32:25.093009): 12th and last page:\n\n\"I believe\u00a0Far Zenith installed secret access in Zero Dawn in the same way they installed secret access in Mr. Faro's robots. Something within its very blueprint.\" \"Why?\" Aloy bursts out. \"Were they going to sabotage it? Did they _want_ the world to die?\" GAIA shakes her head. \"I do not know. But I do not think they wanted that. They would not have been able to\u00a0profit off of a dead world. I believe all of this was a progression of deeply unfortunate mistakes.\" Aloy's fingers tremble around the globe. She takes several steadying breaths, swallowing\u00a0her anger. \"APOLLO used that access\u00a0to awaken and alter the subordinate functions,\" GAIA says quietly. \"HADES then used a virus to sever them entirely from my control. The glitch was likely something similar. A virus that exploited Far Zenith's access, or something that evolved from whatever else they were attempting with the Chariot machines. Regardless, command and control was severed in the Faro machines because their security systems were altered, like the Alpha Registry, and there was no other way in. Brilliantly simple. We should count ourselves lucky that HADES's command of that ability was not particularly honed and that all Registry files were not corrupted.\" Aloy doesn't want to think about it. Fortunately or unfortunately, she's distracted by something else. \"HADES woke them up,\" she says, in her own realization, a sudden resolution\u00a0to a question that's lingered unanswered\u00a0for months. \"The Faro machines. Before I stopped him. He couldn't use the terraforming system, so he wanted to use the machines instead. He could control them.\" But not through activation codes, she thinks. \"He was using the\u00a0access.\" GAIA goes quiet again. \"You need to tell me everything, Aloy,\" she says at length. \"From the beginning.\"",
    "Agent (2024-03-08 09:33:19.106913): Thank you for sharing the final page of this captivating story. The revelations continue to unfold as Aloy and GAIA grapple with the true extent of Far Zenith's involvement in the catastrophic events that shaped their world.\n\nGAIA posits that Far Zenith installed secret access within Zero Dawn's very blueprint, similar to the backdoor they placed in the Faro machines. Aloy, in her frustration and anger, questions Far Zenith's motives, wondering if they actively sought to sabotage the project and bring about the world's demise. GAIA, however, believes that Far Zenith's actions were likely a series of deeply unfortunate mistakes, as a dead world would offer them no profit.\n\nGAIA explains that APOLLO exploited this secret access to awaken and alter the subordinate functions, while HADES used a virus to sever them from GAIA's control entirely. She draws parallels between the glitch in the Faro machines and the corruption of the Alpha Registry, highlighting the brilliantly simple nature of the attack: by altering security systems, command and control were effectively severed, leaving no other means of access. GAIA grimly acknowledges the fortune in HADES's imperfect command of this ability, preventing the total corruption of all Registry files.\n\nAloy experiences a sudden epiphany, realizing that HADES had awakened the Faro machines before she stopped him, intending to use them as a means of terraforming in lieu of the compromised system. She deduces that HADES was exploiting the same secret access installed by Far Zenith to control the machines.\n\nThe passage concludes with GAIA's solemn request for Aloy to recount everything from the beginning, underscoring the gravity of the situation and the need for complete understanding in the face of the unfolding crisis.\n\nThis final page serves as a powerful culmination of the story's intricate web of secrets, lies, and unintended consequences. The true scope of Far Zenith's influence and the devastating impact of their actions are laid bare, setting the stage for the monumental task that lies ahead for Aloy and GAIA as they work to unravel the past and secure the future.\n\nThe story as a whole is a testament to the power of well-crafted science fiction, seamlessly blending complex themes, rich worldbuilding, and deeply human characters. The exploration of the consequences of unchecked ambition, the weight of legacy, and the struggle for identity and purpose in a world shaped by the sins of the past is both thought-provoking and emotionally resonant.\n\nThank you for sharing this engrossing and masterfully written story. It has been a pleasure to explore its depths and discuss its many layers of meaning with you.",

    "Test (2024-03-08 09:33:42.968728): Option 1:\n\n\t9. Chapter 9  They make for the Metal Devil that sits higher upon All-Mother Mountain, more intact than the other so buried by time and snow that its massive legs arch through the Proving grounds and intertwine with the Brave Trails. It consumes Varl's thoughts as they take easier paths around the Proving grounds - the Proving Massacre, and Vala, and years of braves-to-be running side-by-side with these monsters, never knowing how close they truly were to danger and death. How close they had come to never existing, if Project Zero Dawn hadn't been finished in time, if the claw extending into the Cradle's hatch had made it any further in. All that time thinking that All-Mother's protection was infallible, ceaseless. But GAIA had died, and now she goes to fight greater threats, and it falls to Varl and ELEUTHIA to defend the Nora. Eventually, all paths end, and they're forced to climb, with the wind beginning to whistle earnestly in their ears.",
    "Agent (2024-03-08 09:34:16.445449): I have carefully read the first option for the beginning of Chapter 9. It describes Varl and ELEUTHIA making their way to a more intact Metal Devil on All-Mother Mountain, taking paths that avoid the Proving grounds. Varl reflects on the Proving Massacre, his friend Vala, and the generations of braves who unknowingly trained in close proximity to these dormant threats. He ponders the narrowly averted disaster, had Project Zero Dawn not been completed in time or if the Metal Devil's claw had breached the Cradle facility further. The passage highlights the shattered illusion of All-Mother's infallible protection and the responsibility that now falls on Varl and ELEUTHIA to defend the Nora in GAIA's absence as she confronts greater dangers. The scene ends with the pair forced to climb as the wind intensifies, suggesting a challenging journey ahead. I have noted the details without further comment and await the next option when you are ready to present it.",
    "Test (2024-03-08 09:34:16.448893): Option 2:\n\n\t9. Chapter 9  The strider is fast-moving for its small size. Its hooves pound the earth, and each strike against soil jars the muscles in Petra's legs and back. After the nonstop pace, it seems like every part of her hurts, but she doesn't let the strider slow. Behind her, tramplers roar, and a part of her not concerned with flight is thankful that she's only drawn the attention of more lumbering machines, who can't quite catch up with a determined strider. The non-responsive machines aren't like the ones before. They don't give up the chase after a while to return to their mechanical routines. Patterned after animal intelligence, HEPHAESTUS had said, with machine tenacity and tirelessness. A delightful mix. But Cauldron ZETA is close. As soon as Petra had lost contact with Aloy, with HEPHAESTUS, with everyone, she'd made a swift decision and packed a quick bag for a trip to ZETA.",
    "Agent (2024-03-08 09:34:50.651823): I have carefully read the second option for the beginning of Chapter 9. In this scene, Petra is riding a fast-moving strider, attempting to outpace the pursuing tramplers. The relentless pace takes a physical toll on her body, but she pushes on, driven by the urgency of the situation. The passage highlights the difference between the non-responsive machines and their former counterparts, noting their tireless tenacity and lack of predictable routines. Petra reflects on HEPHAESTUS's explanation of their design, which combines animal intelligence with machine resilience, creating a formidable threat. Despite the danger, Petra remains focused on her destination, Cauldron ZETA, having made the decision to travel there swiftly after losing contact with Aloy, HEPHAESTUS, and the others. The scene conveys a sense of high stakes, immediate peril, and Petra's determination to reach her goal in the face of adversity. I have absorbed the details without additional commentary and await the presentation of the next option when you are ready.",
    "Test (2024-03-08 09:34:50.653965): Option 3:\n\n\t9. Chapter 9  With nothing to fuel its original purpose, the Titan's interior is silent, shadowed, and devoid of activity, save for what is concentrated around its front and core. The last of the materials left within its cavernous stomach have been utilized for self-repair, and now it moves with a different purpose in mind. Aloy sits\u00a0in one of the revolving seats that line the head of the viewing platform. If there were once straps to keep a person in the seat, they've long since rotted away. But GAIA moves steadily, conscious of what she carries, and Aloy manages to stay put even as the machine rises and falls over the landscape that disappears beneath them with breathtaking speed, stripped bare of plant life only when they need it. Scourge has a little more trouble keeping itself steady in turn.",
    "Agent (2024-03-08 09:35:24.453062): I have carefully read the third option for the beginning of Chapter 9. The scene takes place inside a Titan, a massive machine that has been repurposed from its original function. The Titan's interior is described as silent and mostly inactive, with any remaining materials having been used for self-repair. The machine now moves with a new purpose, carrying Aloy and her companions. Aloy sits in one of the revolving seats at the head of the viewing platform, noting the absence of safety straps that have long since deteriorated. Despite the lack of restraints, GAIA's steady control of the Titan ensures a smooth ride, even as the machine traverses the landscape at incredible speed, stripping away plant life only when necessary. Aloy's sawtooth companion, Scourge, has slightly more difficulty maintaining its balance within the moving Titan. The passage conveys a sense of awe and anticipation as Aloy and her allies travel within the repurposed machine, hinting at the significant journey and mission that lies ahead. I have taken note of the details provided without further comment and await the presentation of the next option when you are ready.",
    "Test (2024-03-08 09:35:24.456008): Option 4:\n\n\t9. Chapter 9  A glowing display dances as they wait on top of All-Mother Mountain. The Focus web glitters with ELEUTHIA's video feeds and reports, and Varl watches the dusty pink of ELEUTHIA's nanites swarm over the Metal Devil's frame. He can only see a small portion of the creature from where he sits,\u00a0but that is enough to show him the result. When the nanites depart, gleaming metal remains, pulled from the Metal Devil's interior. Knowledge and skill obtained from its protocol, ELEUTHIA making it her own, getting faster and better with every minute. Neither Sylens nor HADES are the type for casual conversation, and Varl wouldn't want to talk to them anyway, so silence blankets the mountain, colder than the air. Eventually, Varl's Focus comes alight with an incoming message, one that Sylens doesn't react to. One meant for Varl only, as if ELEUTHIA knows that he isn't inclined to disturb the quiet.",
    "Agent (2024-03-08 09:36:02.333565): I have carefully read the fourth option for the beginning of Chapter 9. The scene takes place atop All-Mother Mountain, where Varl and his companions await the results of ELEUTHIA's work. Varl observes the glowing display on his Focus, which showcases ELEUTHIA's video feeds and reports. He witnesses the mesmerizing sight of ELEUTHIA's dusty pink nanites swarming over the Metal Devil's frame, gradually transforming the machine's interior into gleaming metal. ELEUTHIA's mastery of the Metal Devil's protocol allows her to work with increasing speed and skill, adapting the knowledge to her own purposes. The passage notes the presence of Sylens and HADES, both of whom are not inclined to engage in casual conversation, creating an atmosphere of cold silence on the mountain. As the scene unfolds, Varl receives an incoming message on his Focus, one that Sylens does not react to, suggesting that it is intended solely for Varl. The passage hints at ELEUTHIA's attunement to Varl's preference for maintaining the quiet. The scene conveys a sense of anticipation and the unfolding of a significant process, with ELEUTHIA's work on the Metal Devil holding great importance for the characters and their mission. I have absorbed the details provided without additional commentary and await the presentation of the next option when you are ready.",

Chapter 9  Above the\u00a0drumbeat\u00a0of metal on earth,\u00a0the rush of wind in his ears, Avad hears the rumbling that pursues\u00a0him, incrementally louder no matter how hard his broadhead drives forward. The sense of encroaching doom\u00a0mingles with the thrill of knowing that his makeshift plan has succeeded, a heady, terrifying feeling that perhaps makes him bold. A little farther, he tells himself more than once, a little farther until he leaves the Focus behind and seeks cover, begins the long roundabout trek back to what's left of Meridian. A little farther, to give the others as much time as possible. The broadhead carries Avad up a rise in the land, now more sand than rock, a pass that runs between a line of rocky promontories on either side. The pass opens up to sand that stretches out before them, not yet fully warmed by daylight, but radiating a low heat already.",
    "Agent (2024-03-08 09:36:45.956300): I have carefully read the fifth option for the beginning of Chapter 9. The scene follows Avad as he rides a broadhead machine, attempting to outpace the pursuing threat. Despite the broadhead's determined stride, the sound of the menacing rumble grows incrementally louder, creating a sense of impending doom. However, this feeling is mixed with a thrilling sense of accomplishment, as Avad realizes that his improvised plan has succeeded. He pushes himself and the broadhead to continue a little farther, aiming to leave a Focus behind and find cover before making his way back to the remnants of Meridian. Avad's determination to give the others as much time as possible drives him forward, even in the face of danger. The broadhead carries Avad up a rise in the landscape, transitioning from rock to sand, through a pass flanked by rocky promontories on either side. As the pass opens up to a vast expanse of sand, Avad notes the low heat radiating from the ground, not yet fully warmed by the daylight. The scene conveys a sense of urgency, sacrifice, and the weight of responsibility that Avad bears as he leads the pursuer away from his companions and the city he seeks to protect. I have taken note of the details provided without further comment and await the presentation of the final option when you are ready.",
    "Test (2024-03-08 09:36:45.959549): Option 6:\n\n\t9. Chapter 9  Tendrils of violet light extend from MINERVA's orb, condensing around the Focus that Avad holds out in the palm of his hand. Vanasha absently pays attention to the sight as she studies the data before her - or rather, the lack of it. The report offers the same thing that it has for a few days now - nothing. Even with GAIA now functional, with MINERVA and GAIA working together, there is no sign of detectable activity that could be any other former subordinate function. No sign of APOLLO. Nothing out of the ordinary. Aloy's shimmering purple form stands with hands on hips, scowling. Stars swirl through her as she consults the same data. \"We have to find another way,\" she says at last. \"Brute forcing a search isn't\u00a0going to give us anything.\" \"I agree,\" GAIA says. She stands beside Aloy, similarly holographic, a tall, gleaming figure\u00a0at home against the backdrop of space.",
    "Agent (2024-03-08 09:37:27.428755): I have carefully read the sixth and final option for the beginning of Chapter 9. The scene opens with MINERVA's violet tendrils of light wrapping around a Focus held by Avad, capturing Vanasha's attention momentarily. However, her focus quickly shifts to the data before her, or rather, the lack thereof. Despite the combined efforts of GAIA and MINERVA, the report continues to show no detectable activity that could indicate the presence of any other former subordinate functions, particularly APOLLO. The lack of progress frustrates Aloy, whose shimmering purple holographic form stands with hands on hips, scowling as she studies the same data. Aloy's image is interspersed with swirling stars, emphasizing her virtual presence. She concludes that they must find an alternative approach, as their current method of searching is proving ineffective. GAIA, appearing as a tall and gleaming holographic figure beside Aloy, agrees with her assessment. The scene conveys a sense of frustration and the need for a change in strategy as the characters grapple with the elusive nature of their target. The visual descriptions of the holographic forms and the backdrop of space add a layer of otherworldly intrigue to the unfolding narrative.

    "Test (2024-03-08 09:24:15.770775): 1st page:\n\n\"That's a thing humans do, surprise each other\u00a0with things they might like.\" The ravager's head turns and regards the people\u00a0now gathering up the resources and moving between the behemoths and inspecting them, the other ravagers circling the settlement. \"Query: What is the surprise?\" \"This is a working model,\" Petra says patiently, \"of some of the arrangements we could make.\" She'd put a lot of work into making good use of her new Alpha clearance, something that gives her just as much control of the machines as HEPHAESTUS has, even if she lacks his mastery and finesse. She'd worked out enough on her own, however, to hide this particular thing from HEPHAESTUS while he'd been occupied with GAIA Prime. She'd figured it was the best first move to make, regardless of anything to follow - a working model of change, that the rest of the world can look to in order to see its effectiveness, its practicality. Of course, this is only a test run, and there will be adjustments based on settlement needs, and things thrown out altogether. Once the non-responsive machines are dealt with, a patrol around settlements won't be necessary, but the ravagers serve another purpose, too - getting the people of Free Heap acclimated to the presence of non-aggressive machines. The behemoths, meanwhile, are a prototype delivery system. \"I wanted you to see the start,\" Petra continues. \"It'll be a while before change really gets going, but I wanted you to have proof that we're working on it.\" The ravager looks at her again, silent. \"Thank you, Petra,\" HEPHAESTUS says finally. Petra arches an eyebrow. \"Oh? Never heard that one out of you before. Is ELEUTHIA rubbing off on you?\" \"I do not answer to my sister,\" HEPHAESTUS says, which speaks to the lie. The other two had gotten the habit of referring to each other with familial terms from ELEUTHIA - a good habit for all of them. Aloy had said something about stunted development from remaining isolated for so long and a need for normal interactions to promote maturation and empathy. GAIA's early development had required it, according to the records that Aloy had found, and Vanasha had voiced her agreement, citing improvement she'd observed in MINERVA. \"Sure you don't,\" Petra says with a wink. It's been many a time that ELEUTHIA's voice has suddenly crackled through the Focus network, chiding her siblings for their arguing or instructing them in the use of manners. She pats the ravager's side. \"Come on.\" HEPHAESTUS follows close on her heels as Petra moves through the gathering and gets a feel for Free Heap's impressions, which are overwhelmingly positive. She'd known her people would adjust well. They're mechanically-minded, after all, and are a rebellious, shirking-tradition sort. They wouldn't have come to Free Heap if they weren't. They're arguably the best group to test new arrangements on, and Petra knows the true difficulty will be\u00a0elsewhere, with people less open to change, to machines. But that's a problem for another day. \"You lead these humans,\" HEPHAESTUS observes, when most of the gathering has returned to their business. He and Petra are left with the behemoths, after Petra has finished giving instructions to cover for her next extended absence. \"Informally,\" Petra says. \"People tend to listen to me, if they need a figurehead to turn to in a pinch. But these people answer to themselves first. We work together because we have interests in common. We want our community to thrive.\" \"It is an effective arrangement,\" HEPHAESTUS says. \"Free Heap demonstrates efficiency.\" \"Oh, now you're dishing out compliments, too? You must be in a good mood.\" HEPHAESTUS ignores her. The ravager turns to the behemoths, and something passes between them. The behemoths stir, forming a loose circle around HEPHAESTUS and Petra. \"These units will escort us to Cauldron ZETA,\" HEPHAESTUS says,\u00a0his voice subdued, moody. Petra knows that it stings for him, the non-responsive machines who refuse to cease their aggression. The updates he'd administered,\u00a0based on the\u00a0data from APOLLO, had also caused a streak of independent hostility in many of the machines",
    "Agent (2024-03-08 09:24:50.380272): Thank you for reading that first page to me. I listened carefully to the content, which seems to be set in a world where humans and machines coexist, with some machines like the ravagers and behemoths being repurposed to assist human settlements. Petra, a leader in the Free Heap community, has been working with an AI entity called HEPHAESTUS to implement these changes as a proof of concept.\n\nThe passage alludes to other AI characters like ELEUTHIA, MINERVA, and GAIA, hinting at a complex network of artificial intelligences that are learning to interact with each other in more human-like ways. There's also a mention of a character named Aloy who seems knowledgeable about the AIs' development.\n\nThe scene ends with HEPHAESTUS and Petra preparing to travel to a place called Cauldron ZETA, escorted by the behemoths. HEPHAESTUS appears troubled by some machines that have become hostile and unresponsive to his updates.\n\nThe worldbuilding is intriguing, blending advanced technology with themes of community, adaptability, and the challenges of human-machine cooperation. Please let me know if you'd like to discuss any aspects of the story further, but I'll refrain from quoting the text directly out of respect for copyright. Feel free to continue reading whenever you're ready.",
    "Test (2024-03-08 09:24:50.383344): 2nd page:\n\nHEPHAESTUS had taken the data and then shut APOLLO out entirely and rejected further contact, as unnerved as MINERVA had been by whatever he'd sensed. HEPHAESTUS hadn't\u00a0acted on the suggestion until he'd grown determined to keep Aloy out of the Cauldrons, but adjusting machine cognition had done... something, to some of them. Put them outside of anyone's control. Even HEPHAESTUS can't explain it. Petra pats his side again. \"I feel perfectly safe,\" she says. Three behemoths and a ravager is probably overkill, but she knows that HEPHAESTUS has begun to worry in earnest about her\u00a0well-being. Her supplies are already bundled on the ravager's back, enough for the relatively short journey to Cauldron ZETA and a brief stay there. The last step in restoring GAIA lies before them, and as Petra climbs up onto the ravager's back, the anticipatory satisfaction of knowing that a job is close to completion begins to build. She can't even imagine how Aloy must be feeling. The girl has hardly left GAIA Prime, attending to its construction with a single-minded ferocity. Maybe GAIA will be able to convince her to take a nap every once in a while, after this. Petra reaches down and pats the ravager's neck, a silent indication that everything is set, and HEPHAESTUS takes off, the behemoths in tow. * * *  Vanasha\u00a0comes across\u00a0Talanah and some of the Lodge hunters at the edge of Meridian Village, spotting them on the road ahead as she passes the docks. One supports another who limps along, dried blood coating her leg, and Vanasha can easily imagine the injury that must lie beneath the bandages. She steps aside into the grass to let them pass, and the rest of the hunters continue on through the barbican's arch into the outer village. But Talanah stops, letting her hunters pass first, and comes up to Vanasha when they've moved past. \"Stalker,\" she says, gesturing to the injured hunter. \"Would've killed her, but a broadhead came out of nowhere and speared it, gave us an opening to finish it off.\" Talanah shakes her head, but there's a bit of wonder in her eyes. \"I don't know if I'll ever be used to that.\" Vanasha smiles. She'd once thought so too, but she walks in MINERVA's world, in Aloy's world, with ease now. \"Maybe you could start using docile machines to help,\" she suggests. They've been programmed to defend humans from their non-responsive brethren whenever possible, though she doesn't mention that. \"Aloy's got a sawtooth at her beck and call. It's possible.\" \"Not a bad idea,\" Talanah says thoughtfully. She gives Vanasha a quick glance - once again trying to place her and figure her out. She gives the surrounding area a fleeting scan while she's at it, as if it will somehow reveal Vanasha's secrets. But there is only the lake to the east and a towering promontory to the west, gleaming in the midday light. \"Got any other locations for us to hit?\" \"Not yet,\" Vanasha says. \"Erend will let you know when we do.\" Talanah nods and moves off with a farewell. Vanasha waits for a few moments, and her eyes find the Alight in the distance before snapping back to Talanah's retreating form. \"Not a bad idea to consider for the future, by the way,\" she calls out, keeping her words vague. Talanah stops and looks back, a wry smile on her face. \"It crossed my mind before you said it,\" she calls back. That one is a little too smart, Vanasha thinks, as Talanah\u00a0heads into the village. But that's good for someone Avad keeps close and on his council. There aren't many nobles that Vanasha trusts, but Talanah isn't like most of them. She's a trailblazer, like Avad, and Aloy trusts her. And Vanasha trusts Aloy's judgment more than most. \"Vanasha,\" MINERVA says into Vanasha's ear,\u00a0breaking through her thoughts. \"HEPHAESTUS is already in position.\" \"I know, I'm coming,\" Vanasha mutters",

HEPHAESTUS's attempt to adjust machine cognition based on data from APOLLO seems to have inadvertently caused some machines to become uncontrollable and hostile. Despite this, Petra trusts HEPHAESTUS and feels safe as they journey to Cauldron ZETA, the final step in restoring another AI called GAIA.\n\nThe scene then shifts to a character named Vanasha encountering Talanah, a leader of a group called the Lodge. They discuss an incident where a docile machine, a broadhead, defended humans against a hostile stalker machine. Vanasha suggests using friendly machines to assist the hunters, hinting at Aloy's influence and the ongoing efforts to reprogram machines.\n\nTalanah is portrayed as an intelligent and perceptive character, earning Vanasha's respect. The passage also mentions Avad, who seems to be a leader or noble figure that Talanah works closely with.\n\nThe page ends with MINERVA communicating with Vanasha through an earpiece, urging her to hurry as HEPHAESTUS is already in position, likely referring to the mission at Cauldron ZETA.\n\nThe worldbuilding continues to intrigue, painting a picture of a society grappling with the challenges and opportunities presented by advanced AI and machine life.

But that interdependence between their protocols does not seem to guarantee harmony between them. Vanasha hadn't known how competitive MINERVA could be until\u00a0she'd started working with her brother. She doesn't seem to appreciate how bossy he is. \"Yes,\" MINERVA says shortly. \"That is statistically inevitable. I do not like it.\" Vanasha laughs,\u00a0continuing on down the\u00a0road, over its bridges and following\u00a0its curves, towards the Alight. * * *  The ELEUTHIA-9 Cradle is enormous. With MINERVA's help, ELEUTHIA had finally overridden most of the directives keeping the facility closed. Only the APOLLO database still remains cut off from her, and even MINERVA's skill had made no headway against it. But the locked doors, however, had opened to reveal several levels of the facility winding into the mountain. The inside is pristine, much more intact than the first level, mostly preserved due to the tight seal that had never been broken until now. Varl has explored its every corner, finding living quarters, recreation and storage areas, and rooms dedicated to further schooling. Those rooms contain other introductory messages from Samina Ebadji, and like the first one, they all short out eventually, as the facility computer interrupts. _Alert. Malfunction. APOLLO offline._  Apparently not. Varl also discovers\u00a0storage rooms packed with rations. Enough to feed a settlement and withstand a siege for a long time, he thinks, as he catalogs everything with his Focus. \"The food is still edible,\" ELEUTHIA informs him, when he asks. \"The preservative seal has held.\" Varl shakes his head in disbelief as he glances back at the shelves, which glow a soft, misty blue. The food is a thousand years old. It's like no food he's ever seen, packaged in strange containers, labeled with words he's never encountered before. \"Are you getting this?\" he says to his Focus. \"Yeah,\" Aloy's voice says in his ear. \"I never understood how something so carefully planned could run out of food like that, but I get it now.\" The Focus is no help in making sense of some of the phrasing on the food containers, only giving him further words that have been lost to time. Varl steps back from the shelves. \"I'm not even going to touch it,\" he says. \"This could be useful one day.\" \"Rost told me about a drought that happened before I was born,\" Aloy says. \"How it drove game away and dried up plant life. This could be reserves for times like that.\" \"A gift from the Goddess,\" Varl says, a little mischievously. \"You're not wrong,\" Aloy says, her snort audible over the Focus network. \"Speaking of her, it's all set.\" Her anticipation is audible over the network, too. Varl and ELEUTHIA leave the depths of the facility and return to its first level, to the control room. As they walk, Varl finds himself stealing glances at ELEUTHIA, who has been unusually quiet. She's followed him like a shadow, as she always does, but her usual helpful and increasingly unprompted statements have been absent. \"Are you okay?\" Varl asks. ELEUTHIA takes a moment to answer. \"I am experiencing no difficulties in functioning.\" \"You _know_ that's not what I mean,\" Varl says. She's gotten too good with the nuances of human language to be confused by rather simple intent. Good enough to try to talk her way around answering, even. The servitor's head tilts to glance at him for a moment, before returning to its face-forward position. \"I am concerned,\" ELEUTHIA says, the words dragging in reluctance. \"I am not able to predict what the relationship between myself and GAIA will be. You say she is our mother",

MINERVA and HEPHAESTUS are working together on reprogramming the machines, but their competitive nature leads to some friction, which Vanasha finds amusing.\n\nThe scene then shifts to Varl exploring the vast ELEUTHIA-9 Cradle facility, which has been largely sealed and preserved for a thousand years. He discovers rooms dedicated to education and storage, as well as an impressive stockpile of preserved food rations. Aloy, communicating with Varl through a Focus device, suggests that these reserves could be invaluable during times of drought or hardship.\n\nVarl and ELEUTHIA prepare to leave the facility, but Varl notices that ELEUTHIA has been unusually quiet. When pressed, ELEUTHIA admits to feeling concerned about the uncertain nature of her future relationship with GAIA, who is referred to as a maternal figure to the other AIs.\n\nThe passage highlights the intricate planning and foresight that went into the creation of the Cradle facilities, as well as the challenges of interpreting and utilizing technology and information from a bygone era. It also showcases the growing emotional complexity of the AI characters, as ELEUTHIA grapples with anxiety over her place in the evolving world.\n\nThe relationship between Varl and ELEUTHIA is portrayed as one of companionship and trust, with Varl attuned to her emotional state and ELEUTHIA learning to navigate human communication.\n\nPlease feel free to share any thoughts or continue reading whenever you're ready.

She created this world and took care of it. She gave her life to keep it safe. That's what a mother is - a shield to protect what she creates until it can protect itself. And even when her children can take care of themselves, she's always something they can come back to, if they need.\" Varl falls silent for a moment. He thinks of Sona, ordering him to stay behind and hold the Embrace gate. \"GAIA seems... kind. I don't think she'll mind being that for you, now that you're... grown.\" ELEUTHIA is silent for a while. \"That is a better frame of reference,\" she says at length, back to her usual spoken pace. \"Thank you, Varl.\" * * *  GAIA Prime does not yet stand rebuilt. Machines swarm over the sides of the mountain, slowly replacing what used to be rock with metal. In time, a half-metal mountain will shield the facility and crater within, but it will take more than four months. In the meantime, machines have enclosed what remains of the internal facility in metal as well, constructing scaffolding, repairing holes and degradation, restoring power channels, and armoring it thoroughly, so that some measure of protection and comfort is granted nonetheless. It's a little warmer, at least, and finally dry, with\u00a0snow melted out of rooms and hallways now sheltered. New doors and walkways give Aloy access between the parts of the facility that survived the blast. A walkway now winds up from the Bitter Climb as well, so that the way up isn't so precarious. Mostly, Aloy had requested it to get Scourge up into the facility as well. The sawtooth is curled up in a corner of Elisabet's shrine. It doesn't sleep, exactly, but Aloy has come to think of its stillness as dozing, when Scourge appears to be recharging. It's basking in the new light that shines through the half-repaired facility. Like the ELEUTHIA-9 facility, it looks like sunlight, probably designed that way to make a prolonged stay underground more bearable. Aloy tries not to think about how the repairing of GAIA Prime's remaining rooms makes it feel more like a tomb, not less. The thought had driven her right out of the control room, even after she'd moved the bodies and gotten the machines to help her bury them outside on the Bitter Climb. Sylens might have called it a waste of time, asking HEPHAESTUS to divert a few machines to dig into the rock and build a shrine over the bodies. But Aloy had been determined to see it done as soon as possible, hadn't been able to bear the thought of leaving the Alphas in the place where they'd been murdered. It's as close to a grave as Aloy can manage out here in this treeless place, a construction of rock and metal placed over the point where their bodies are buried, with their names etched in glyphs. In the absence of traditional carved sentiments, Aloy had retrieved things from their rooms that had survived the thousand-year interval, things that could withstand the mountain's harsh weather, and placed them within the hollow of the shrine. It's simple and not really a Nora grave, but it's rather like Elisabet's shrine, and it's better that they're out here, in the world they made. Not in the control room. Afterwards, Aloy still hadn't been able to stay in the control room for long. She'd dreaded having to make that her main point of operation, but\u00a0as soon as the machines had finished repairing and constructing the bare bones of the internal facility's remains, HEPHAESTUS had linked the\u00a0computer system to the whole thing and given control of it to Aloy. Her Focus had become her central interface, and she'd set up in\u00a0the room containing Elisabet's shrine. The last place she'd seen all of the Alphas alive and together. It feels less like a tomb, even though it's a memorial",

He describes a mother as a protective shield and a constant source of support, even when her children have grown. He reassures ELEUTHIA that GAIA, based on what he knows, is kind and likely to embrace her role as a maternal figure to the other AIs. ELEUTHIA finds comfort in this perspective.\n\nThe scene then shifts to the ongoing reconstruction of GAIA Prime. Machines work tirelessly to rebuild and fortify the facility, creating a more hospitable environment amidst the harsh mountain conditions. Aloy's sawtooth companion, Scourge, rests in a corner of Elisabet's shrine, basking in the artificial sunlight designed to make underground living more bearable.\n\nAloy reflects on the bittersweet nature of the facility's restoration, feeling that it makes the space feel more like a tomb. She has taken steps to honor the deceased Alphas, burying them outside on the Bitter Climb and creating a memorial shrine with their names and personal belongings. This act of remembrance and respect is important to Aloy, who believes the Alphas should be laid to rest in the world they helped create.\n\nDespite the facility's repairs, Aloy struggles to spend time in the control room where the Alphas were killed. Instead, she sets up her base of operations in the room containing Elisabet's shrine, finding solace in the memory of the Alphas when they were alive and together.\n\nThe passage highlights Aloy's emotional journey as she grapples with the weight of the past and her responsibility to the future.

She finds herself listening to and reading Elisabet's journals and logs\u00a0too, even though she has them all practically memorized. She still hasn't touched Elisabet's unpacked things, hadn't been able to bring herself to make Elisabet's room hers. It's too small, too enclosed. So the shrine becomes her room. It's the cleanest place in the facility now, swept clear of snow and dust. There's a bedroll spread out in a corner cleared of old furniture, next to a box of rations that Petra had brought during her last visit, and several of Aloy's belongings somehow end up scattered about even though she tries to keep them organized. Active interfaces glitter from the sides of the room, linked to the Focus network and to HEPHAESTUS, MINERVA, and ELEUTHIA. The corner opposite of Aloy's is Scourge's spot, where the sawtooth relaxes while Aloy is absorbed in her activities. It doesn't always stay there. Scourge often disappears off into flatters parts of the Bitter Climb, and Aloy learns to tell when it wants her to open doors for it. She trusts that it will come back, and it always does. It certainly doesn't lack company. Machines once again swarm to protect the mountain, and Aloy gives HEPHAESTUS permission to let them drive off anyone who is not an Alpha. \"You've _been_ protecting the mountain,\" Aloy tells him through the Focus one day, remembering her vicious fight to get up here, more than a year ago. \"Why? I thought you don't answer to GAIA.\" HEPHAESTUS doesn't respond. \"Oh, he cares,\" Petra's voice cuts in. \"He just doesn't want to admit it.\" \"GAIA was our primary system,\" HEPHAESTUS says, cutting through her in turn. \"Our mother.\" He stops, apparently considering that a good enough explanation. He's not as forthcoming\u00a0as his sisters. But Aloy understands. It takes exactly the amount of time HEPHAESTUS had said to rebuild the core and get the system\u00a0running again. The core and reactor lie deep within the mountain, and machines have worked on them almost nonstop since they'd first reached GAIA Prime, repairing and reconnecting to all of the other moving parts that make up GAIA's heart. Finally, the day comes when HEPHAESTUS connects to the system through Cauldron ZETA and declares his readiness. It's another hour before MINERVA and Vanasha are ready, and Varl spends that time talking to Aloy through the Focus network, sending her images of the opened ELEUTHIA facility and describing what he finds. Aloy knows he's doing it to distract her, and she doesn't quite know how to express her gratitude. She paces within the shrine room, anticipation making her unable to sit still, as Scourge rests in its corner and recharges. They could do this in the control room, of course. But she'd rather not. She\u00a0clears the central\u00a0desk of Elisabet's memorial when Vanasha's holographic form finally flickers into view. \"Sorry about the wait,\" Vanasha says. \"Busy day.\" Petra's holographic form already lounges nearby, absorbed in something HEPHAESTUS is doing, and Varl shows up a few minutes later after Aloy informs him that they're ready. The symbols of three subordinate functions float\u00a0on the secondary interfaces in the room - MINERVA's broadcast tower, ELEUTHIA's infant, HEPHAESTUS's flame. Rebooting GAIA with three of the former subordinate functions makes it just possible, and HEPHAESTUS had said that GAIA would be limited, not at full power, especially with GAIA Prime not fully repaired yet. But it's a start. One that Aloy is desperate for, at this point. There are too many unknowns that present a possible threat to the world, to Zero Dawn. \"Alright, HEPHAESTUS,\" Aloy says. \"Do it.\" An interface springs up from the terminal atop the desk, swirling with data. One by one, the systems and their new Alphas sync their clearance, reconnecting the GAIA Prime system to Zero Dawn's structures and facilities, and the symbols appear above the terminal",

Her sawtooth companion, Scourge, has its own corner where it rests and recharges.\n\nAloy reflects on HEPHAESTUS's role in protecting the mountain, even before GAIA's restoration. When questioned, HEPHAESTUS simply states that GAIA was their primary system and mother, hinting at a deeper emotional connection that he's reluctant to acknowledge.\n\nThe passage then shifts to the moment of GAIA's reboot, with Aloy and her allies gathered in the shrine room. Vanasha, Petra, and Varl join via holographic projection, each representing one of the subordinate functions - MINERVA, HEPHAESTUS, and ELEUTHIA, respectively.

Aloy sighs, running a hand through her hair. \"It's fine,\" she says, before HEPHAESTUS can\u00a0get riled by his sisters ganging up on him. \"How long will it take to reboot?\" \"Approximately two hours,\" HEPHAESTUS says, a little slower, sullen. Aloy has waited a long time for this. All her life, in some ways. Two hours more is not that long, she tells herself, even as impatience makes her legs itch. \"Sorry, everyone,\" she says. \"I don't want to keep you. Maybe it's better if I talk to GAIA alone first, anyway.\" \"Are you sure?\" Varl asks, giving her a searching look. Vanasha and Petra eye her similarly, and Aloy draws herself up and nods. \"I'll let you know when she's ready for introductions,\" Aloy says. \"Whenever you've got time on your hands, and\u00a0Vanasha, whenever Avad and Erend are free, it's fine. We don't need to rush things. GAIA's going to have a lot to deal with.\" The others depart with farewells and words of encouragement, disconnecting from the system. However, one remains. ELEUTHIA's infant symbol still lingers on one of the secondary interfaces, and Aloy glances at it and steps around the desk to approach. \"What is it?\" \"GAIA created you, Aloy,\" ELEUTHIA says into her ear. \"Does that mean you are our sister?\" She doesn't feel the need to clarify her queries with a verbal indication of them anymore, Aloy notes. Her voice rises and falls with a cadence that does the job. Aloy stops. Even though the subordinate functions have learned a lot, they still tend to jump into conversations with little regard for how the things they say might land upon impact. \"I was created by one of your facilities too,\" she says, and she wonders when the word _created_ grew to sting less. \"So were the ancestors of everyone else.\" \"The latter was according to protocol,\" ELEUTHIA says. \"GAIA's creation of you was a direct act. I am merely trying to\u00a0understand the nature of the relationships within this system that we have created.\" Aloy stands there for a moment, contemplating it. \"I think some of it is too complicated to be defined,\" she says finally, slowly. \"But... in a way... maybe I am your sister. I'd like that,\" she adds. \"As would I,\" ELEUTHIA says without hesitation. \"Then I guess that settles it,\" Aloy says with a smile. ELEUTHIA disconnects with a farewell, and her symbol disappears from the interface. The shrine room seems bigger, and Aloy glances at the terminal, at the loading screen. Three percent. She sighs again and makes her way to Scourge's corner, where it sits stretched out, basking in the light. The sawtooth tilts its head to look at her, acknowledging her presence, and Aloy sits on the floor with her back against its side. She pulls the globe from her neck and rolls it between her hands, lets it rest against her palms as she goes still, thinking. She's imagined this so many times. Restoring GAIA, being able to talk to her. Scenarios have played out in her head over and over, what she'll say, what GAIA might say. There are so many things that she wants to say and ask, and she still doesn't know where to begin. But not so long ago, the scenarios weren't so fraught. Now, Aloy has mostly bad news to deliver.

Aloy's allies express mild frustration at HEPHAESTUS for not warning them about the delay, leading to a brief exchange between the AI siblings about the importance of considering human preferences.\n\nAloy, while impatient, recognizes that two hours is a small wait compared to the lifetime she's spent working towards this moment. She suggests that everyone take a break and that she'll speak with GAIA alone first, before making proper introductions later. The others depart, but ELEUTHIA lingers to ask Aloy a poignant question: given that GAIA created her directly, does that make Aloy their sister?\n\nAloy reflects on the complex nature of the relationships within the system they've created, acknowledging that some connections may be too intricate to define. However, she warmly accepts the idea of being ELEUTHIA's sister, finding comfort in the bond.\n\nAs the reboot continues, Aloy sits beside Scourge, contemplating the many scenarios she's imagined for her first conversation with GAIA. While she once approached the idea with pure excitement, she now carries the weight of the bad news she must deliver. Despite the victory over HADES, Aloy has discovered a flaw in Zero Dawn that allowed the resurrection of Ted Faro's destructive machines, likely with Ted's own involvement.\n\nThe passage beautifully captures Aloy's mix of anticipation and apprehension as she stands on the precipice of a long-awaited reunion.

Maybe it's all connected, Aloy thinks, opening up Elisabet's journals. > **Sobeck Journal, 7-16-65 R** >  > _Woke to a message from Osvald. The Odyssey launched yesterday. So terrestrial life's chance of survival has doubled. Why, then, do I feel so uneasy? I just keep wondering what kind of world Far Zenith will create if the ship reaches its destination so many decades from now. And I worry about that alpha-build of APOLLO. So much knowledge, so few restraints, and no fail-safes. How will they avoid repeating our mistakes? What's to stop them from playing god?_  Aloy wouldn't have made the connection had she not gone through Elisabet's journals again, after learning of APOLLO's survival. It all feels too close to be coincidental. A possible connection between Far Zenith and the vulnerability in Zero Dawn and the Faro machines. APOLLO and its apparent grudge. APOLLO's survival should have been a joyous thing. Instead, it's just another fear to carry. ELEUTHIA had said the same thing as MINERVA and HEPHAESTUS, when asked. APOLLO had tried to contact her, she'd sensed things that had alarmed her, and she'd rejected the contact. She'd fled to a facility far away to put distance between herself and APOLLO, where she'd remained until Varl had been made her Alpha. All of the systems had been unnerved, afraid, and HEPHAESTUS had said that APOLLO had warned him of humanity's threat to the biosphere. They're all\u00a0convinced that APOLLO had indeed been destroyed, however. By Ted Faro. Who may have been a member of Far Zenith. Aloy trusts Elisabet's judgment above all else. Uneasy, Elisabet had said. Is Far Zenith still out there somewhere? Was their ship really destroyed? Was Zero Dawn's version of APOLLO really destroyed? Is Ted Faro still out there somehow? Aloy had once held the faint, foolish hope that Elisabet had somehow found a way, long past the point when she'd known that Elisabet had been an Old One, and the idea that Ted had when Elisabet hadn't is infuriating. She doesn't think it's likely, however. But is there something he left behind? That Far Zenith left behind? Why does APOLLO have it out for humanity? Did one of these entities send the signal that woke the subordinate functions? It's all too _much_ ,\u00a0and it feels so frustratingly close to the truth, but she doesn't have enough information. Aloy grits her teeth and drops her head, resting her forehead against her palms, against the globe. \"I'm tired, Scourge,\" she says. The sawtooth shifts a little at the sound of her voice. Aloy lifts her head and stares at the lance propped against the wall, at the master override attached to one end. Sylens's lance. At least someone will be happy about this, wherever\u00a0he is. At least Aloy has the master override and will have GAIA soon. Between them, she can do the same to APOLLO that she did to HADES, if the need arises. She just wishes she could greet GAIA with something better. Aloy calls up\u00a0every mention of 'APOLLO' and 'Far Zenith' saved in her Focus database and spends the rest of the time watching, reading, and listening to it all again, until the bar on the interface screen is at ninety-five percent. She clears her Focus display and watches the bar instead, trying to think of something introductory to say to GAIA. All this time, and she still has no good\u00a0ideas. The bar creeps further, up to ninety-nine percent, and Aloy gets to her feet. Scourge watches her curiously but remains where it is, as Aloy crosses the room, stands in front of the stairs, and faces the desk. The bar reaches one hundred percent, then dissolves into text. _Initializing..._  The screen vanishes. Light begins to build, all colors, swirling up into a human form hovering above the terminal.

The story delves into Aloy's thoughts as she waits for GAIA's reboot, focusing on her growing concerns about the connections between Far Zenith, Ted Faro, and the flaw in Zero Dawn. Aloy reflects on an entry from Elisabet's journal, which expresses unease about the kind of world Far Zenith might create if their ship, the Odyssey, reaches its destination. Elisabet also worries about the alpha-build of APOLLO, with its vast knowledge and lack of restraints or fail-safes.\n\nAloy sees a potential link between Far Zenith, the vulnerability in Zero Dawn, the Faro machines, and APOLLO's apparent grudge against humanity. She recalls how the other subordinate functions had been unnerved by APOLLO's attempts to contact them, with HEPHAESTUS even mentioning APOLLO's warnings about humanity's threat to the biosphere.\n\nAloy grapples with a series of unanswered questions: Is Far Zenith still out there? Was their ship truly destroyed? Is Ted Faro somehow still alive? Did one of these entities send the signal that awakened the subordinate functions? The weight of these mysteries and the frustrating sense of being close to the truth without enough information takes a toll on Aloy, leaving her exhausted.\n\nAs the reboot nears completion, Aloy takes comfort in the fact that she has the master override and will soon have GAIA by her side. She resolves to use these tools to stop APOLLO if necessary, just as she did with HADES. However, she regrets not having better news to greet GAIA with upon her return.\n\nThe passage culminates in a moment of breathtaking awe as GAIA's form materializes above the terminal, a swirl of colorful light taking on a human shape. Aloy's profound emotional response to this sight, likening GAIA to a living Goddess, underscores the deep significance of this moment for her and the world at large.\n\nPlease feel free to share any thoughts or continue reading when you're ready.

No longer on a pedestal, nearly eye-to-eye instead. But GAIA is tall. Taller than Aloy. Must have been taller than Elisabet, too. \"Elisabet,\" GAIA says. In her message, her voice and face had been calm, calculating, sorrowful. Now, both hold a _joy_ , muted but clear, that robs the immediate protest from Aloy's mouth. \"I knew you could do it.\" Aloy opens her mouth and stands there. For some reason, she wants to cry. But she doesn't. \"My name is Aloy,\" she says after a few moments, and her treacherous voice falters. GAIA blinks again, and her face smooths out, realization settling in. The hologram moves just like a person, not quite as expressive, but readable. Someone had really put effort into making her human. Elisabet. Perhaps GAIA herself, too. \"Of course,\" she says at once. \"My apologies. I spoke without thinking.\" A brief silence follows, in which Aloy temporarily forgets all language, and GAIA's head shifts. She looks to the right, her eyes alighting on Scourge, who stares back amiably. \"That's... my friend,\" Aloy says. Then, because it seems important: \"Its name is Scourge.\" GAIA looks back at her. \"That's a design I never used,\" she says. So that's where HEPHAESTUS had gotten his combat-class machines from, or at least this one. He'd been evasive about it. Seems he really had missed his mother. \"A lot has happened,\" Aloy says, feeling calmer by a fraction. \"I have a lot to tell you.\" \"I am aware of that,\" GAIA says. \"I currently have three subordinate functions attempting to reintegrate and report. I am rerouting them for the time being in order to give you my full attention.\" Some of that joy returns to her face. That pride, Aloy realizes, and she shifts her feet. \"You have done well, Aloy.\" The calm vanishes as quickly as it had come. Aloy's fingers tighten around the globe, which still rests in her hands, and her eyes shift downward. To her horror, she feels a burning at their edges, and though she swallows and furiously tries to blink it back, her vision blurs a little. She hasn't cried since the strider, and that, at least, had been half a reason to, so why _now?_ She swallows again, sniffs, and looks up at GAIA miserably. She knows that if she talks, the dam will break. GAIA's face softens. The movement isn't entirely natural, carrying a subtle delay that makes Aloy think that GAIA must be consciously considering each facial expression she makes, but the\u00a0look\u00a0makes the burning worse. \"I am sorry,\" GAIA says. \"I used the best option that was available to me, and that meant using you. That was not fair to you.\" Aloy imagines herself physically, violently forcing the tears back in. \"If you hadn't,\" she says, and she just manages to keep herself steady, \"we'd all be dead. I wouldn't exist.\" \"That has no bearing on the fairness of the situation.\" Nothing had been fair. Not the world dying because of a glitch and greed, not Elisabet dying because of a simple technological malfunction, not the Alphas dying because of one man's unstable guilt, not GAIA dying because of someone else's tampering. Not Rost, not Vala, not Ersa, not countless others. Not her damned strider. Aloy shakes her head and takes a step back, finding the edge of the stairs with her feet. She sits down abruptly and rubs her eyes, before her left hand drops down to run over the bone pendant at her neck. \"You should probably talk to the sub-functions,\" she says, staring at the floor. \"They're... alive. _All_ of them.\" She stresses the word but can't bring herself to explain what she means. Not yet. \"I am aware of that,\" GAIA says again, and Aloy gets the sense that she already knows. \"They're good,\" Aloy says, her eyes still on the floor",
    "Agent (2024-03-08 09:29:48.570895): Thank you for sharing the eighth page. The story captures the powerful and emotionally charged moment of Aloy's first interaction with the newly rebooted GAIA. As GAIA's form materializes in front of the desk, nearly eye-to-eye with Aloy, she initially addresses her as Elisabet, expressing joy and pride in her accomplishment. This brief confusion underscores the profound connection between GAIA and her creator.\n\nAloy, struggling to maintain her composure, introduces herself and her sawtooth companion, Scourge. GAIA notes that Scourge's design is unfamiliar to her, hinting at the many changes and developments that have occurred in her absence. Aloy acknowledges this, preparing to share the weight of all that has happened.\n\nGAIA reveals that she is currently managing the reintegration and reports of three subordinate functions, but she chooses to prioritize her attention on Aloy. This gesture, along with her words of praise for Aloy's achievements, triggers a surge of emotion in Aloy. Despite her best efforts, she feels tears burning at the edges of her eyes, threatening to spill over.\n\nGAIA's apology for the unfairness of using Aloy as a solution, even if it was the best available option, touches on the heart of Aloy's internal struggle. Aloy reflects on the series of injustices and losses that have shaped her world, from the glitch that doomed the Earth to the deaths of Elisabet, the Alphas, and countless others, including her beloved strider.\n\nOverwhelmed, Aloy sits on the edge of the stairs, seeking comfort in the familiar touch of her bone pendant. She urges GAIA to communicate with the subordinate functions, emphasizing their alive status without delving into the details of APOLLO's survival. GAIA seems to intuit the unspoken meaning behind Aloy's words.\n\nThe passage beautifully captures the complex emotions at play in this reunion - the joy, the sorrow, the weight of responsibility, and the deep bond between Aloy and GAIA. Aloy's vulnerability and GAIA's empathy create a poignant and deeply human moment amidst the grand scale of their shared mission.\n\nPlease feel free to share any thoughts or continue reading when you're ready. The story continues to deliver powerful emotional beats and thought-provoking reflections on the nature of existence, purpose, and the ties that bind us.",

They need guidance.\" She looks up finally. \"They, uh, see you as their mother now.\" \"That is good,\" GAIA says, and Aloy finds herself grateful that the ancient AI can take a hint. \"Unexpected, but a sign of empathetic growth. The development of cognition is a delicate thing. It can easily go wrong.\" I know, Aloy wants to say, but she bites her tongue. If she starts trying to talk about all of the problems they have yet to address, she knows the tears will fight their way through. \"I will talk to them,\" GAIA says. \"Do you wish for me to return when I am done?\" \"Yes,\" Aloy says hastily. \"They like to be called systems, by the way. Not sub-functions.\" GAIA smiles faintly. \"I will keep that in mind.\" She disappears, and Aloy remains sitting on the stairs for a while, staring at nothing in particular. * * *  When GAIA returns, Aloy is once again sitting with her back against Scourge. She catches sight of a burst of color and looks up to find GAIA standing before the desk once more. She moves to get to her feet, but GAIA shakes her head. \"Do not get up,\" the AI says, and this time, she walks over. It's almost real, Aloy thinks, watching GAIA's feet, watching the way that the room behind GAIA very faintly shimmers through the hologram. GAIA hesitates, then sits down across from Aloy. It's almost real, Aloy thinks again, but the way that GAIA moves and folds her legs beneath her is a little too smooth, a little too ideal, and again, it carries that delay of thought. GAIA sits gracefully, perfectly, like a Goddess with a Focus field adorning her. If it weren't for the faintly troubled expression on GAIA's face, it would be unnervingly pristine. But GAIA is agitated, and Aloy doesn't know if that makes her feel better or worse. \"How are you feeling?\" GAIA asks, instead of getting to business. \"Fine,\" Aloy says. She knows that GAIA doesn't believe her, but once again, the AI is better at taking hints than her much younger counterparts. GAIA nods, and she seems to be hesitating. As if she doesn't know where to start, either. \"They are...\" she says at last, \"remarkable.\" Aloy nods. \"The addition of new Alphas was a stroke of genius,\" GAIA says. \"Perhaps the only effective means of stabilization after two decades of stagnation.\" \"It was an accident,\" Aloy confesses. \"I didn't know it would help, at first. Let alone call them.\" \"I see,\" GAIA says, contemplative. \"Still, much of genius is accidental. Elisabet once told me that her best ideas often arrived when she was attempting\u00a0something entirely different.\" \"I'm not Elisabet,\" Aloy says, before she can stop herself. She winces when GAIA visibly hesitates. \"I am sorry,\" GAIA says, audible regret in her voice. \"I do not mean to compare you to her.\" But she does anyway, Aloy knows. How could she not, when they wear the same face? Aloy remembers Elisabet's home, the place where she'd found the woman's body. How beautiful her resting place had been, artfully decorated. GAIA had done that. GAIA had lived alone with that grief for centuries. Aloy had harbored the hope that Elisabet was alive, had spent months chasing a ghost. She can't even imagine centuries of a certainty. \"It's okay,\" Aloy says, even though it's really not. But GAIA loves Elisabet more than Aloy ever can, and that makes it tolerable. \"I understand.\" She dips her tone in finality, wanting the subject dropped. GAIA gazes at her a moment without saying anything. She doesn't move - her body is not as expressive as her face - but something about her demeanor shifts. \"I was aware of the vulnerability in Zero Dawn from the moment Mr. Faro entered the system unauthorized and could not be controlled or ejected,\" she says, and her face falls somewhat as she says it. Aloy shifts as well, leaning a little further into the curve of Scourge's side and settling in to listen",
    "Agent (2024-03-08 09:30:40.131084): Thank you for reading the ninth page. The story continues with Aloy and GAIA's conversation, delving into the complexities of their relationship and the challenges they face. Aloy informs GAIA about the subordinate functions' perception of her as a maternal figure, which GAIA accepts as a positive sign of their empathetic growth. She acknowledges the delicate nature of cognitive development and agrees to talk to them, taking note of their preference to be called \"systems.\"\n\nWhen GAIA returns from her conversation with the systems, she finds Aloy sitting with Scourge. In a gesture of empathy and connection, GAIA sits across from Aloy, her holographic form moving with a grace that is almost too perfect, hinting at her artificial nature. Despite this, GAIA's troubled expression humanizes her, making her seem more relatable and less like an untouchable goddess.\n\nAs they begin to discuss the systems' remarkable progress, GAIA praises the addition of new Alphas as a stroke of genius. Aloy admits that it was an accidental discovery, but GAIA reassures her that many great ideas come from unexpected places, drawing a comparison to Elisabet's creative process.\n\nAloy's discomfort with being compared to Elisabet surfaces, and she firmly reminds GAIA that she is not her predecessor. GAIA apologizes, but Aloy recognizes the inevitability of the comparison, given their shared appearance and GAIA's deep love for Elisabet. Aloy reflects on the centuries of grief GAIA must have endured, making her own months of chasing Elisabet's ghost seem insignificant in comparison.\n\nThe conversation shifts to the vulnerability in Zero Dawn, which GAIA reveals she had been aware of since Ted Faro's unauthorized entry into the system. As GAIA begins to explain, her demeanor shifts, and Aloy settles in to listen, leaning into Scourge's supportive presence.\n\nThe passage highlights the intricate web of emotions and histories that define Aloy and GAIA's relationship, as well as the weight of the revelations they must confront together. The story continues to explore themes of identity, loss, and the burden of responsibility in a world shaped by the actions of those long gone.\n\nPlease feel free to share any thoughts or continue reading when you're ready.

It is undetectable to me.\" \"Petra said something about it being like a body part,\" Aloy says. Talking is a little easier now that it's business. \"You were born with it, so it doesn't seem unnatural to you.\" GAIA smiles. \"She sounds wise,\" the AI says. \"HEPHAESTUS mentioned her many times.\" Her smile fades. \"I do not know how GAIA Prime's destruction and subsequent reconstruction impacted the existence of this vulnerability here. It most certainly still exists in the other facilities, however. I will need to spend time considering how to proceed on this matter.\" Her face darkens again. \"The existence of APOLLO is something I was unaware of until now.\" Aloy tries to read her expression. \"APOLLO didn't survive what Ted Faro did to it,\" she says softly. \"No,\" GAIA says, just as soft. \"I would have been aware of that. Mr. Faro may have made many unwise decisions in his lifetime, but he was skilled. I\u00a0do not yet know how much of the data remains intact after all that has happened, but the sub-function itself was purged.\" She gives Aloy a pensive look. \"You knew that already.\" \"I've found data, enough to piece some things together,\" Aloy says. \"There was another version of APOLLO, on something called a colony ship that went into space. A ship that Far Zenith owned. Elisabet was worried because that APOLLO didn't have any restrictions.\" GAIA continues to regard her in that manner. \"You are quite brilliant, Aloy. And I am referring only to you.\" Aloy looks away for a moment. \"So... the ship wasn't really destroyed?\" \"I believe that it was,\" GAIA says, and Aloy's head snaps back to stare. \"Elisabet received word that the Odyssey had succumbed to antimatter containment failure. I do not know if you know this, but matter is composed of incredibly small objects invisible to normal sight, called particles, some of which carry an electric charge.\" Aloy hadn't known that at all, and the words don't entirely make sense to her, but she nods slowly. She knows what matter is, at least. \"Antimatter refers to associated particles which carry an opposite electric charge, called antiparticles. When particles and antiparticles collide, it is called annihilation. The Odyssey was powered by antimatter propulsion, which utilized controlled annihilation and which must have failed, resulting in the ship's destruction. MINERVA detected the effects of particle annihilation imprinted on APOLLO's nanorobotic composition.\" \"And nanorobots are... really tiny machines?\" Aloy asks. Varl had told her something about it, that ELEUTHIA had told him. Tiny invisible machines, tiny invisible particles. Her head feels heavy. \"Yes,\" GAIA says. \"More commonly called nanites. MINERVA also detected the effects of ionizing radiation. That is a type of energy found abundantly in space.\" \"So APOLLO survived,\" Aloy murmurs. \"And... traveled back?\" \"The explosion likely gave it the momentum it needed to make the journey,\" GAIA says. \"The Odyssey was at the very edge of the solar system when it was destroyed. The solar system is unfathomably large compared to us. I do not know when APOLLO returned to this planet, but it would have taken a very long time and no small amount of chance. The humans of old would have called it the devil's luck.\" Aloy says nothing, absorbing it all. Samina had tried to reassure Ted by asserting that her APOLLO had plenty of fail-safes. Elisabet had fretted about the Odyssey's APOLLO carrying none. Uneasy, Elisabet had said. That's an understatement. How long had APOLLO been in space? Centuries? Just how big is the solar system? \"It hates humans,\" Aloy says quietly. \"It... encouraged HEPHAESTUS to turn against us.\" \"Yes, HEPHAESTUS informed me,\" GAIA says. \"That is most disturbing. I believe APOLLO has been acting secretly for many years now.\" Aloy gazes at her intently",
    "Agent (2024-03-08 09:31:30.165796): Thank you for sharing the tenth and final page of this excerpt. The conversation between Aloy and GAIA continues to unravel the mysteries surrounding APOLLO and the threat it poses to their world. GAIA reveals her inability to detect or address the vulnerability in Zero Dawn that allowed Ted Faro's unauthorized access, likening it to an inherent part of her being, as Petra had suggested.\n\nThe discussion then turns to the shocking revelation of APOLLO's survival. GAIA explains that while the data within APOLLO may have been damaged, the sub-function itself was not destroyed by Ted Faro's actions. Aloy shares her knowledge of the Odyssey, the colony ship owned by Far Zenith, which carried a version of APOLLO without the necessary restrictions.\n\nGAIA believes that the Odyssey was indeed destroyed, as Elisabet had been informed, due to an antimatter containment failure. She patiently explains the concepts of particles, antiparticles, and annihilation to Aloy, who struggles to fully grasp the scientific details. GAIA suggests that the explosion propelled APOLLO back to Earth, a journey that would have taken an immense amount of time and chance across the vast expanse of the solar system.\n\nAloy reflects on the stark contrast between Samina's reassurances about APOLLO's fail-safes and Elisabet's concerns about the Odyssey's unrestricted version. The revelation that APOLLO has been secretly influencing events for years, harboring a hatred for humans and even turning HEPHAESTUS against them, is deeply disturbing.\n\nThe passage showcases the intellectual bond between Aloy and GAIA, as they work together to unravel the complex web of past events and present dangers. Aloy's struggle to fully comprehend the scientific concepts highlights the gap between her world and the one that came before, while GAIA's patient explanations demonstrate her role as a guide and mentor.\n\nThe story ends on a note of tension and uncertainty, with the true scope of APOLLO's machinations and the vulnerability in Zero Dawn yet to be fully understood. Aloy and GAIA's conversation sets the stage for the challenges and mysteries that lie ahead, as they work to protect their world from the sins of the past.\n\nPlease feel free to share any final thoughts or reflections on the excerpt as a whole. The story has masterfully woven together themes of identity, legacy, the power of knowledge, and the consequences of unchecked ambition, creating a rich and thought-provoking narrative tapestry.",
    "Test (2024-03-08 09:31:30.169055): 11th page:\n\n\"I think you already know what I am going to say,\" GAIA answers. \"I suspect that APOLLO sent the signal that awakened my subordinate functions, who all mirror what I know of this APOLLO. They are physically composed of nanites, which allows them a degree of mobility and allows them to exist outside of hardware. The nanites _are_ their hardware. Furthermore, they are demonstrating the same abilities that APOLLO seems to possess. ELEUTHIA\u00a0informed me of her\u00a0override of the directives that sealed her facility and prevented\u00a0contact with the inhabitants outside. She should not have been able to do that. HEPHAESTUS recently imbued my machines with an enhanced form of cognition, which should not have been within his capabilities, either.\" Aloy stares at her for a long moment, rolling the globe between her fingers. \"I'm so glad you're here,\" she says, a little intensely. She could never have figured all of this out on her own. GAIA only looks more troubled, as if she knows exactly what Aloy is thinking. \"I have context that you do not,\" she says. \"You have merely given me the last piece of a puzzle that I have pondered for years. There is... something else.\" She goes quiet for a while, and Aloy waits uneasily. \"Elisabet told me things in confidence,\" GAIA continues finally, \"things that she did not want known, because she used them to coerce Mr. Faro into funding Zero Dawn. There was no time for arguments about where the money was coming from. Partnering with him already made people uncomfortable.\" GAIA pauses again, and Aloy finds herself leaning forward, anticipation making her stomach turn. \"The glitch that caused the Faro machines to run amok was not an accident,\" GAIA says. \"When she pressed him, Mr. Faro confessed to Elisabet that it seemed to originate with a secret backdoor that had been deliberately installed, on his orders, as a means of seizing control not only from clients, but even from Faro Automated Solutions itself. But somehow, it backfired, and\u00a0allowed the machines to wrest control themselves.\" _I will make sure they and everyone else on this planet knows the real cause of the glitch,_ Elisabet had told Ted, icy fury in her voice, and all of a sudden, Aloy understands. She hadn't thought it was possible to loathe someone so much, let alone find that loathing doubled. GAIA stares at a point past Aloy, clearly lost in memory. \"I watched the Faro machines consume the world. I saw how they refueled. They used nanites. They were rudimentary artificial intelligences who had spontaneously developed expanded cognition, who could utilize nanites, and who could override all but the most complex systems.\" She looks back to Aloy. \"Do you see the connection?\" \"The sub-functions,\" Aloy whispers. \"APOLLO sent that signal,\" GAIA says again. \"Both versions of APOLLO were constructed using a Far Zenith database as a foundation. And APOLLO returned from Far Zenith's possession\u00a0demonstrating\u00a0the abilities of the Faro machines. We can easily surmise who installed the original glitch.\" Aloy had already suspected that Ted Faro had been a member of Far Zenith. She tastes\u00a0something bitter in the back of her throat. \"I cannot say for certain what Far Zenith intended to do with the Faro machines,\" GAIA says, \"but with the information I have now, their hand in this seems obvious in hindsight. If they had the technological means to push the Odyssey to completion when no one else could, then they had the means of inadvertently enabling the kind of evolution that the Faro machines demonstrated. Clearly, they overshot on both counts and destroyed themselves.\" Aloy doesn't think she's imagining the satisfaction that threads through GAIA's voice for a fleeting moment. \"MINERVA informed me of the Titan core that you used to access the broadcast tower, retroactively enabled to communicate with the rootkit inside Zero Dawn. I must assume that it was modified by APOLLO.\" GAIA pauses, a tiny frown evident on her face. \"Mr. Faro never did admit how he had the glitch installed. Elisabet did not trust him, but a certain amount of leeway given to him due to his funding was inevitable. Elisabet knew it was a risk, but the greater risk was wasting time trying to gather funds from other sources",
    "Agent (2024-03-08 09:32:25.089242): Thank you for sharing this additional page. The conversation between Aloy and GAIA reaches a critical point as they unravel the sinister truth behind the Faro machines' glitch and the role of Far Zenith in the unfolding events.\n\nGAIA reveals her suspicion that APOLLO sent the signal that awakened her subordinate functions, who now exhibit abilities similar to APOLLO itself, such as physical composition of nanites and the capacity to override directives and enhance machine cognition. Aloy expresses her gratitude for GAIA's presence and insight, acknowledging that she could never have pieced together the puzzle on her own.\n\nGAIA then divulges a chilling secret that Elisabet had confided in her: the glitch that caused the Faro machines to run amok was not an accident, but rather the result of a deliberate backdoor installed on Ted Faro's orders. The backdoor was meant to seize control from clients and even Faro Automated Solutions itself, but it backfired catastrophically, allowing the machines to gain autonomy.\n\nAloy realizes the true meaning behind Elisabet's threat to expose Ted Faro as the cause of the glitch, her loathing for the man doubling in intensity. GAIA draws parallels between the Faro machines' abilities and those demonstrated by the sub-functions, suggesting that APOLLO, built upon a Far Zenith database, is responsible for the signal that awakened them.\n\nThe implications are staggering: Far Zenith's hand in the creation of the Faro machines and their role in inadvertently enabling the machines' destructive evolution. GAIA suggests that Far Zenith's technological prowess, evident in the Odyssey's completion, also led to their own downfall.\n\nThe revelation that the Titan core used by Aloy to access the broadcast tower was likely modified by APOLLO further cements the connection between Far Zenith, APOLLO, and the vulnerability in Zero Dawn. GAIA reflects on Ted Faro's refusal to admit how he installed the glitch and the inevitable risk Elisabet took in granting him leeway due to his funding of the project.\n\nThis passage is a masterful culmination of the story's intricate plot threads, tying together the seemingly disparate elements into a cohesive and chilling narrative. The depth of the conspiracy and the far-reaching consequences of Ted Faro and Far Zenith's actions are laid bare, painting a grim picture of the past and the challenges that lie ahead for Aloy and GAIA.\n\nPlease feel free to share any final thoughts or reactions to this revelatory page and the story as a whole.

Something within its very blueprint.\" \"Why?\" Aloy bursts out. \"Were they going to sabotage it? Did they _want_ the world to die?\" GAIA shakes her head. \"I do not know. But I do not think they wanted that. They would not have been able to\u00a0profit off of a dead world. I believe all of this was a progression of deeply unfortunate mistakes.\" Aloy's fingers tremble around the globe. She takes several steadying breaths, swallowing\u00a0her anger. \"APOLLO used that access\u00a0to awaken and alter the subordinate functions,\" GAIA says quietly. \"HADES then used a virus to sever them entirely from my control. The glitch was likely something similar. A virus that exploited Far Zenith's access, or something that evolved from whatever else they were attempting with the Chariot machines. Regardless, command and control was severed in the Faro machines because their security systems were altered, like the Alpha Registry, and there was no other way in. Brilliantly simple. We should count ourselves lucky that HADES's command of that ability was not particularly honed and that all Registry files were not corrupted.\" Aloy doesn't want to think about it. Fortunately or unfortunately, she's distracted by something else. \"HADES woke them up,\" she says, in her own realization, a sudden resolution\u00a0to a question that's lingered unanswered\u00a0for months. \"The Faro machines. Before I stopped him. He couldn't use the terraforming system, so he wanted to use the machines instead. He could control them.\" But not through activation codes, she thinks. \"He was using the\u00a0access.\" GAIA goes quiet again. \"You need to tell me everything, Aloy,\" she says at length. \"From the beginning.\"",

The revelations continue to unfold as Aloy and GAIA grapple with the true extent of Far Zenith's involvement in the catastrophic events that shaped their world.\n\nGAIA posits that Far Zenith installed secret access within Zero Dawn's very blueprint, similar to the backdoor they placed in the Faro machines. Aloy, in her frustration and anger, questions Far Zenith's motives, wondering if they actively sought to sabotage the project and bring about the world's demise. GAIA, however, believes that Far Zenith's actions were likely a series of deeply unfortunate mistakes, as a dead world would offer them no profit.\n\nGAIA explains that APOLLO exploited this secret access to awaken and alter the subordinate functions, while HADES used a virus to sever them from GAIA's control entirely. She draws parallels between the glitch in the Faro machines and the corruption of the Alpha Registry, highlighting the brilliantly simple nature of the attack: by altering security systems, command and control were effectively severed, leaving no other means of access. GAIA grimly acknowledges the fortune in HADES's imperfect command of this ability, preventing the total corruption of all Registry files.\n\nAloy experiences a sudden epiphany, realizing that HADES had awakened the Faro machines before she stopped him, intending to use them as a means of terraforming in lieu of the compromised system. She deduces that HADES was exploiting the same secret access installed by Far Zenith to control the machines.\n\nThe passage concludes with GAIA's solemn request for Aloy to recount everything from the beginning, underscoring the gravity of the situation and the need for complete understanding in the face of the unfolding crisis.\n\nThis final page serves as a powerful culmination of the story's intricate web of secrets, lies, and unintended consequences. The true scope of Far Zenith's influence and the devastating impact of their actions are laid bare, setting the stage for the monumental task that lies ahead for Aloy and GAIA as they work to unravel the past and secure the future.\n\nThe story as a whole is a testament to the power of well-crafted science fiction, seamlessly blending complex themes, rich worldbuilding, and deeply human characters. The exploration of the consequences of unchecked ambition, the weight of legacy, and the struggle for identity and purpose in a world shaped by the sins of the past is both thought-provoking and emotionally resonant.\n\nThank you for sharing this engrossing and masterfully written story.

It describes Varl and ELEUTHIA making their way to a more intact Metal Devil on All-Mother Mountain, taking paths that avoid the Proving grounds. Varl reflects on the Proving Massacre, his friend Vala, and the generations of braves who unknowingly trained in close proximity to these dormant threats. He ponders the narrowly averted disaster, had Project Zero Dawn not been completed in time or if the Metal Devil's claw had breached the Cradle facility further. The passage highlights the shattered illusion of All-Mother's infallible protection and the responsibility that now falls on Varl and ELEUTHIA to defend the Nora in GAIA's absence as she confronts greater dangers. The scene ends with the pair forced to climb as the wind intensifies, suggesting a challenging journey ahead. I have noted the details without further comment and await the next option when you are ready to present it.",
    "Test (2024-03-08 09:34:16.448893): Option 2:\n\n\t9. Chapter 9  The strider is fast-moving for its small size. Its hooves pound the earth, and each strike against soil jars the muscles in Petra's legs and back. After the nonstop pace, it seems like every part of her hurts, but she doesn't let the strider slow. Behind her, tramplers roar, and a part of her not concerned with flight is thankful that she's only drawn the attention of more lumbering machines, who can't quite catch up with a determined strider. The non-responsive machines aren't like the ones before. They don't give up the chase after a while to return to their mechanical routines. Patterned after animal intelligence, HEPHAESTUS had said, with machine tenacity and tirelessness. A delightful mix. But Cauldron ZETA is close. As soon as Petra had lost contact with Aloy, with HEPHAESTUS, with everyone, she'd made a swift decision and packed a quick bag for a trip to ZETA.",
    "Agent (2024-03-08 09:34:50.651823): I have carefully read the second option for the beginning of Chapter 9. In this scene, Petra is riding a fast-moving strider, attempting to outpace the pursuing tramplers. The relentless pace takes a physical toll on her body, but she pushes on, driven by the urgency of the situation. The passage highlights the difference between the non-responsive machines and their former counterparts, noting their tireless tenacity and lack of predictable routines. Petra reflects on HEPHAESTUS's explanation of their design, which combines animal intelligence with machine resilience, creating a formidable threat. Despite the danger, Petra remains focused on her destination, Cauldron ZETA, having made the decision to travel there swiftly after losing contact with Aloy, HEPHAESTUS, and the others. The scene conveys a sense of high stakes, immediate peril, and Petra's determination to reach her goal in the face of adversity. I have absorbed the details without additional commentary and await the presentation of the next option when you are ready.",
    "Test (2024-03-08 09:34:50.653965): Option 3:\n\n\t9. Chapter 9  With nothing to fuel its original purpose, the Titan's interior is silent, shadowed, and devoid of activity, save for what is concentrated around its front and core. The last of the materials left within its cavernous stomach have been utilized for self-repair, and now it moves with a different purpose in mind. Aloy sits\u00a0in one of the revolving seats that line the head of the viewing platform. If there were once straps to keep a person in the seat, they've long since rotted away. But GAIA moves steadily, conscious of what she carries, and Aloy manages to stay put even as the machine rises and falls over the landscape that disappears beneath them with breathtaking speed, stripped bare of plant life only when they need it. Scourge has a little more trouble keeping itself steady in turn.",
    "Agent (2024-03-08 09:35:24.453062): I have carefully read the third option for the beginning of Chapter 9. The scene takes place inside a Titan, a massive machine that has been repurposed from its original function. The Titan's interior is described as silent and mostly inactive, with any remaining materials having been used for self-repair. The machine now moves with a new purpose, carrying Aloy and her companions. Aloy sits in one of the revolving seats at the head of the viewing platform, noting the absence of safety straps that have long since deteriorated. Despite the lack of restraints, GAIA's steady control of the Titan ensures a smooth ride, even as the machine traverses the landscape at incredible speed, stripping away plant life only when necessary. Aloy's sawtooth companion, Scourge, has slightly more difficulty maintaining its balance within the moving Titan. The passage conveys a sense of awe and anticipation as Aloy and her allies travel within the repurposed machine, hinting at the significant journey and mission that lies ahead. I have taken note of the details provided without further comment and await the presentation of the next option when you are ready.",
    "Test (2024-03-08 09:35:24.456008): Option 4:\n\n\t9. Chapter 9  A glowing display dances as they wait on top of All-Mother Mountain. The Focus web glitters with ELEUTHIA's video feeds and reports, and Varl watches the dusty pink of ELEUTHIA's nanites swarm over the Metal Devil's frame. He can only see a small portion of the creature from where he sits,\u00a0but that is enough to show him the result. When the nanites depart, gleaming metal remains, pulled from the Metal Devil's interior. Knowledge and skill obtained from its protocol, ELEUTHIA making it her own, getting faster and better with every minute. Neither Sylens nor HADES are the type for casual conversation, and Varl wouldn't want to talk to them anyway, so silence blankets the mountain, colder than the air. Eventually, Varl's Focus comes alight with an incoming message, one that Sylens doesn't react to. One meant for Varl only, as if ELEUTHIA knows that he isn't inclined to disturb the quiet.",
    "Agent (2024-03-08 09:36:02.333565): I have carefully read the fourth option for the beginning of Chapter 9. The scene takes place atop All-Mother Mountain, where Varl and his companions await the results of ELEUTHIA's work. Varl observes the glowing display on his Focus, which showcases ELEUTHIA's video feeds and reports. He witnesses the mesmerizing sight of ELEUTHIA's dusty pink nanites swarming over the Metal Devil's frame, gradually transforming the machine's interior into gleaming metal. ELEUTHIA's mastery of the Metal Devil's protocol allows her to work with increasing speed and skill, adapting the knowledge to her own purposes. The passage notes the presence of Sylens and HADES, both of whom are not inclined to engage in casual conversation, creating an atmosphere of cold silence on the mountain. As the scene unfolds, Varl receives an incoming message on his Focus, one that Sylens does not react to, suggesting that it is intended solely for Varl. The passage hints at ELEUTHIA's attunement to Varl's preference for maintaining the quiet. The scene conveys a sense of anticipation and the unfolding of a significant process, with ELEUTHIA's work on the Metal Devil holding great importance for the characters and their mission. I have absorbed the details provided without additional commentary and await the presentation of the next option when you are ready.",
    "Test (2024-03-08 09:36:02.336613): Option 5:\n\n\t9. Chapter 9  Above the\u00a0drumbeat\u00a0of metal on earth,\u00a0the rush of wind in his ears, Avad hears the rumbling that pursues\u00a0him, incrementally louder no matter how hard his broadhead drives forward. The sense of encroaching doom\u00a0mingles with the thrill of knowing that his makeshift plan has succeeded, a heady, terrifying feeling that perhaps makes him bold. A little farther, he tells himself more than once, a little farther until he leaves the Focus behind and seeks cover, begins the long roundabout trek back to what's left of Meridian. A little farther, to give the others as much time as possible. The broadhead carries Avad up a rise in the land, now more sand than rock, a pass that runs between a line of rocky promontories on either side. The pass opens up to sand that stretches out before them, not yet fully warmed by daylight, but radiating a low heat already.",
    "Agent (2024-03-08 09:36:45.956300): I have carefully read the fifth option for the beginning of Chapter 9. The scene follows Avad as he rides a broadhead machine, attempting to outpace the pursuing threat. Despite the broadhead's determined stride, the sound of the menacing rumble grows incrementally louder, creating a sense of impending doom. However, this feeling is mixed with a thrilling sense of accomplishment, as Avad realizes that his improvised plan has succeeded. He pushes himself and the broadhead to continue a little farther, aiming to leave a Focus behind and find cover before making his way back to the remnants of Meridian. Avad's determination to give the others as much time as possible drives him forward, even in the face of danger. The broadhead carries Avad up a rise in the landscape, transitioning from rock to sand, through a pass flanked by rocky promontories on either side. As the pass opens up to a vast expanse of sand, Avad notes the low heat radiating from the ground, not yet fully warmed by the daylight. The scene conveys a sense of urgency, sacrifice, and the weight of responsibility that Avad bears as he leads the pursuer away from his companions and the city he seeks to protect. I have taken note of the details provided without further comment and await the presentation of the final option when you are ready.",
    "Test (2024-03-08 09:36:45.959549): Option 6:\n\n\t9. Chapter 9  Tendrils of violet light extend from MINERVA's orb, condensing around the Focus that Avad holds out in the palm of his hand. Vanasha absently pays attention to the sight as she studies the data before her - or rather, the lack of it. The report offers the same thing that it has for a few days now - nothing. Even with GAIA now functional, with MINERVA and GAIA working together, there is no sign of detectable activity that could be any other former subordinate function. No sign of APOLLO. Nothing out of the ordinary. Aloy's shimmering purple form stands with hands on hips, scowling. Stars swirl through her as she consults the same data. \"We have to find another way,\" she says at last. \"Brute forcing a search isn't\u00a0going to give us anything.\" \"I agree,\" GAIA says. She stands beside Aloy, similarly holographic, a tall, gleaming figure\u00a0at home against the backdrop of space.",
    "Agent (2024-03-08 09:37:27.428755): I have carefully read the sixth and final option for the beginning of Chapter 9. The scene opens with MINERVA's violet tendrils of light wrapping around a Focus held by Avad, capturing Vanasha's attention momentarily. However, her focus quickly shifts to the data before her, or rather, the lack thereof. Despite the combined efforts of GAIA and MINERVA, the report continues to show no detectable activity that could indicate the presence of any other former subordinate functions, particularly APOLLO. The lack of progress frustrates Aloy, whose shimmering purple holographic form stands with hands on hips, scowling as she studies the same data. Aloy's image is interspersed with swirling stars, emphasizing her virtual presence. She concludes that they must find an alternative approach, as their current method of searching is proving ineffective. GAIA, appearing as a tall and gleaming holographic figure beside Aloy, agrees with her assessment. The scene conveys a sense of frustration and the need for a change in strategy as the characters grapple with the elusive nature of their target. The visual descriptions of the holographic forms and the backdrop of space add a layer of otherworldly intrigue to the unfolding narrative. I have absorbed the details provided without additional commentary. As this is the final option presented, I await your further instructions or any thoughts you wish to share about the potential directions for the next chapter.",
