    "Agent (2024-05-09 17:19:28.787863): That's a clever play on words! The phrase \"it takes a lot of balls\" is usually used figuratively to mean that something requires a lot of courage or bravery. \n\nBut in this case, you've given it a literal meaning related to golf, since golf is played using balls. So by saying \"It takes a lot of balls to golf the way I do\", you're humorously implying that your golf style is unconventional or daring in some way.\n\nVery witty - the double meaning puts a funny twist on the common expression. Thanks for sharing that golf quip with me!",

Dr. Arron Kelvey: The time we will meet is when the sun is high.\n\nAnalyzing the messages together, it seems they are planning a meeting or rendezvous at a specific location and time:\n\n- The meeting will take place when the sun is high, likely referring to midday or noon.\n- The meeting spot is where apples grow, possibly an apple orchard.\n- Seana is instructed to bring a means to cross a river, suggesting the meeting location is near a river that needs to be traversed.\n\nIn summary, the three individuals plan to meet around noon in an apple orchard that requires crossing a river to reach. Seana will provide the transportation to get across the river.\n\nThe messages appear to be using coded or discreet language, possibly to keep the specifics of their meeting private. Without more context, it's difficult to determine the exact purpose or nature of this rendezvous.\n\nPlease let me know if you need any clarification or have additional information to provide about these messages.",
