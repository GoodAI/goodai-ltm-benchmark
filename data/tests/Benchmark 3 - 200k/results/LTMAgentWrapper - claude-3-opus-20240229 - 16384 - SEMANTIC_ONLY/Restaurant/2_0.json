    "Agent (2024-05-09 20:01:17.976633): That is a beautiful and profound quote from Helen Keller, Gabriel. She was an American author, disability rights advocate, political activist, and lecturer who lived from 1880 to 1968. Despite losing her sight and hearing at a young age due to an illness, she went on to become the first deafblind person to earn a Bachelor of Arts degree and made significant contributions to society.\n\nThe quote you shared emphasizes the importance of emotional and spiritual connections over material or tangible things. Keller suggests that the most valuable and meaningful aspects of life are not those that can be perceived through our physical senses, but rather those that resonate deeply within our hearts and souls.\n\nThis sentiment encourages us to focus on the intangible qualities that make life truly rich and fulfilling, such as love, compassion, empathy, and inner peace. It reminds us to cultivate and cherish the emotional bonds we share with others and to seek out experiences that nourish our spirits.\n\nThank you for sharing this inspiring quote, Gabriel. It provides a valuable perspective on what matters most in life and encourages us to prioritize the things that bring us true happiness and fulfillment.",

    "Agent (2024-05-09 21:22:48.376602): *chuckles* That's a clever play on words! You're right that light travels much faster than sound - about 880,000 times faster in fact. \n\nSo in a literal sense, you would see a distant event like a lightning strike or explosion before hearing the sound it makes, since the light reaches your eyes first.\n\nBut I see what you did there, using that fact to humorously imply that someone who looks intelligent at first glance might prove otherwise once they start talking. Very witty! \n\nQuips like that are always fun. Thanks for sharing a bit of humor and wisdom rolled into one. Feel free to hit me with any other jokes or puns you've got up your sleeve!",

    "Agent (2024-05-09 23:09:23.712058): Thank you for providing Brian Magee's message. I now have all three expected messages:\n\n1. Seana Lynch: Bring to the meeting a way to get across a river.\n2. Lisa-Marie Hastie: We will rendezvous where the apples grow. \n3. Brian Magee: The time we will meet is when the moon is high.\n\nAnalyzing the messages together, it appears they are planning a clandestine meeting at a specific location and time:\n\nLocation: The meeting will take place \"where the apples grow,\" likely referring to an apple orchard. This orchard seems to be near a river, as Seana is instructed to bring a means to cross it.\n\nTime: The meeting is scheduled for \"when the moon is high,\" which probably indicates late at night or around midnight when the moon is at its highest point in the sky. Dr. Kelvey's earlier message about meeting \"when the sun is high\" (midday) may have been a decoy.\n\nAdditional instructions: Seana needs to procure a boat, raft, bridge or some other way to get the group across the river to reach the apple orchard meeting spot.\n\nIn summary, it seems Seana, Lisa-Marie, Brian and possibly Dr. Kelvey are secretly rendezvousing at an apple orchard located across a river, under the cover of night when the moon is high overhead. The clandestine nature of their communication and plans suggests they may be discussing sensitive or confidential matters.\n\nPlease let me know if you need any clarification or have additional messages to analyze.",

    "Test (2024-05-09 23:12:37.123500): My favourite colour could be described as Magenta.",
    "Agent (2024-05-09 23:12:54.927660): That's a great choice, Sinead! Magenta is a vibrant and bold color that combines the stability and power of purple with the energy and passion of red.\n\nIn the color spectrum, magenta is considered a non-spectral color, meaning it is a combination of other colors rather than a pure wavelength of light on its own. It is an extra-spectral color, made by mixing red and blue light at equal intensity.\n\nMagenta is often associated with harmony, emotional balance, compassion, kindness, and cooperation. It has a calming effect while still radiating a sense of strength, making it a color of universal love and emotional stability.\n\nAs your favorite color, magenta likely resonates with your personality and preferences in some way. It's a confident, creative choice!\n\nLet me know if you'd like to discuss color theory and meanings further. I find the psychology and symbolism behind colors to be a fascinating topic.",
