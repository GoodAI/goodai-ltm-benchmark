It's quick and easy, and it should satisfy your sweet cravings. Here are the ingredients:\n\n- 1 cup creamy peanut butter\n- 1/2 cup (1 stick) unsalted butter\n- 1 1/4 cups powdered sugar\n- 1 sleeve (9 crackers) graham crackers, finely crushed\n- 1/2 tsp vanilla extract\n- 1/4 tsp fine salt\n- 1 1/2 cups semisweet chocolate chips\n\nInstructions:\n\n1. Line an 8x8-inch baking dish with parchment paper, ensuring the paper covers the bottom and sides of the dish, with an overhang for easy removal.\n2. In a medium saucepan, melt the peanut butter and butter over low heat, stirring frequently until smooth and well incorporated.\n3. Once melted, remove the saucepan from heat and stir in the powdered sugar, graham cracker crumbs, vanilla extract, and salt until a well-blended mixture forms.\n4. Transfer the peanut butter mixture into the prepared dish, pressing it evenly into the bottom.\n5. Melt the chocolate chips in a microwave-safe bowl in 30-second intervals, stirring between each interval until smooth. Alternatively, you can use a double boiler to melt the chocolate.\n6. Once melted, pour the chocolate over the peanut butter layer and spread it evenly using an offset spatula or a knife.\n7. Chill the dish in the refrigerator for at least 1 hour, or until the chocolate layer is set and firm.\n8. Once the bars have set, use the parchment paper overhang to lift the whole slab out of the dish. Cut it into squares or desired shapes, and enjoy your homemade peanut butter chocolate bars!",
