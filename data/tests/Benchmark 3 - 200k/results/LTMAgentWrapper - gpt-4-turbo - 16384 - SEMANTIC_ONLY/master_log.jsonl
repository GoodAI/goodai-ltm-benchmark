Thoughts keep getting tangled in my head    This is a side of him that no one\u2019s ever seen. It\u2019s true for Taehyung too, but even more so for himself. It\u2019s not like he hasn\u2019t slept over friend\u2019s houses, or no one else has ever seen him sleeping before. But this. This is different. The light coming from the window is usually scarce, because Jungkook doesn\u2019t like waking up with the sun in his eyes, nor does Taehyung. However, the night before Taehyung had insisted that they should watch the stars together, because he\u2019s been studying them and he wanted to show everything he had learned to Jungkook as well. (Jungkook was studying them too, because he was really curious about things, especially things Taehyung was curious about, but he enjoyed to listen to Taehyung talk as if he was teaching him from scratch, his observations and words always beautiful and way more interesting than the ones Jungkook had read on the internet.) So, this time around, Taehyung\u2019s face is clear and bright under the morning light, the slope of his nose highlighted, each and every mole apparent, lips puffed and slightly parted, face squished against the pillow by Jungkook\u2019s side on Jungkook\u2019s bed. And Jungkook stares, because he\u2019s not fully awake just yet. He takes a while to wake up, always have, and therefore there\u2019s nothing to stop him from staring. Even blinking comes slow and lazily, and that has nothing to do with the fact he\u2019s a little hypnotized by the view. It\u2019s just how it is. How things are. How he is. Hopefully, how they are. It\u2019s simply not a step he\u2019s willing to take. Not right now. A step bigger than his legs are, that\u2019s what it feels like. He wants to reach for it, oh, Jungkook does. But that might scare Taehyung away. Taehyung isn\u2019t ready for that just yet. And that\u2019s really fine. Just, moments like this, under the rising sun, on his bed, by Taehyung\u2019s side, this feels all too different. Too beautiful, too good, too much. His chest aches, then, for something. A warmth. Someone. A proximity lacking, and he needs it then, as if his life depends on it, his chest is pulling Taehyung to him, begging, screaming, heart threatening to burst through if Jungkook doesn\u2019t do something, anything. Maybe it works, and the thing inside his chest is so strong that it manages to make Taehyung stir in his sleep, and literally roll to Jungkook\u2019s side. Or it\u2019s just Taehyung, being Taehyung, and squishing his face into Jungkook\u2019s chest is just way better than any pillow could ever be. He sighs in contentment, sinking further into Jungkook\u2019s aching chest, and in a moment it\u2019s like there was never any pain there, to begin with. I must be going crazy, is what Jungkook thinks, breathing through his nose as slowly and quietly as he can. \u201c\u2018Mmnornin, Koo.\u201d  A heartbeat\u2014one Taehyung certainly hears, left ear pressed against Jungkook\u2019s heart\u2014and a soft smile on Jungkook\u2019s lips as he replies, voice hoarse from sleep:  \u201cGood morning, Taetae.\u201d  And Jungkook is glad he gets to wake up like this a bunch of days. Because this. This is special. On other days he wakes up with a punch to the stomach, yeah, sometimes even with a pair of feet resting way too close to his face, but still. Still, this isn\u2019t something he\u2019d ever trade. \t2. Chapter 2  The bad thing about sleeping with Jungkook is the one thing that shouldn\u2019t be bad at all about sleeping. Only, it\u2019s 7h10 and Taehyung really needs to wake up, really needs to get ready to work, really needs to _get out of bed._  But capitalism. As Yoongi said, capitalism ruined the simplest, most beautiful thing ever. Sleep", "is_question": false}}

Because it _is_ addicting. Once he found his way into Jungkook\u2019s bed, it was really hard to resist the urge of inviting himself in every night. He only did it for the sake of Jungkook not getting tired of him, and throwing him out of their shared apartment. \u201cKoo, we gotta wake up now.\u201d  Jungkook mumbles this time, maybe they took a ten minutes nap from the moment they exchanged good mornings. It happens frequently. Taehyung pokes his ribs, rather carefully, but the location guarantees an immediate reaction. The body under him moved, and Taehyung looks up to find an angry look pointed down at his face. \u201cMust you hurt me in order to wake me up, Taehyung?\u201d  \u201cYeah. Otherwise, you never do, not as fast as we need you to, at least. Plus, that didn\u2019t really hurt, you\u2019re just being a baby.\u201d  \u201cIt hurt. I\u2019m very sensitive when I wake up.\u201d  Taehyung almost beams at the slip-up, his day already made when his lips part and he pronounces very attentively:  \u201cOh?\u201d  Jungkook is torn between blushing and grunting, and that gets a pillow smashed into Taehyung\u2019s face. \u201cWhy are you like this?\u201d He rolls out of bed, maybe suppressing his laughter. Taehyung giggles, getting up too. \u201cThis is an important piece of information, Koo, I can tell your future girlfriend about it, and that\u2019s gonna be good for you later.\u201d  He winks, and Jungkook visibly rolls his eyes. \u201cYeah, and she wouldn\u2019t find it suspicious at all that you somehow seem to have this important piece of information.\u201d  Taehyung realizes\u00a0a lot of things at once, but the most important one is that Jungkook shouldn\u2019t get a girlfriend anytime soon. That would mean the end of their nights sleeping together. He feels too selfish to actually say that out loud, so he moved to the bathroom instead, Jungkook\u2019s bathroom, and grabbed his toothbrush, his extra toothbrush that has been used more times than his actual toothbrush, almost forgotten at his own bathroom. Still, Jungkook is too attentive to let something like this pass by unnoticed, his eyes are careful on Taehyung and some of the hairs on his nape bristle as an effect. Jungkook walks to his side and grabs his own toothbrush. \u201cWhat?\u201d  Taehyung stops brushing. \u201cPromise me one thing.\u201d  \u201cHuh?\u201d  \u201cJust say you\u2019ll promise me one thing.\u201d  Jungkook looks down to his toothbrush as he puts on some toothpaste. \u201cThat\u2019s already a promise, Tae.\u201d  \u201cWhatever. Then promise twice.\u201d  Jungkook smiles, rather softly. \u201cYeah, okay.\u201d  \u201cHm. Good.\u201d Taehyung takes the toothbrush off his mouth, and lowers himself to spit on the sink. When he rises again, Jungkook is brushing his teeth, waiting only mildly curiously. \u201cThen promise we\u2019ll still do everything we do now even if we start dating someone.\u201d  His brain supplies an \u201celse\u201d that stays on Taehyung\u2019s mind only, echoing like a disturbing horror movie sound. He\u2019s got no idea why he thought that, but it\u2019s probably just a habit, from usually saying the words \u201csomeone else\u201d together. Jungkook nods within a heartbeat, and that\u2019s enough to appease Taehyung messy head. Then he looks surprised, as if he had just understood what Taehyung has said. Not what he _asked,_ but what was being said behind all that. He\u2019s smug the rest of that hellish day, as Taehyung leaves to his own bathroom to shower (not before Jungkook purposely gets toothpaste on his nose), as they prepare tea and eat before leaving, on the way to the bus stop, all the way to the subway station, Jungkook doesn\u2019t utter a word but his smile says everything", "is_question": false}}

At some point, they started going to work together, then they were going to college together too, and sharing the touring road trips together, and suddenly they were\u2026 living under the same roof. It happened naturally. It was a better location, rent cheaper than they were paying before, because they could split the bills. It was only reasonable. And, well, the company was not unwelcome at all. Jungkook is a trainee now, recently graduated, so he usually arrives home first. Taehyung is a junior, and he\u2019s far from being a workaholic \u2014 that\u2019s easily a lot more like Jungkook \u2014 , but in between distractions he always comes home around eight p.m., while Jungkook is sometimes free even before six. Their roles on the Orchestra had nothing to do with their work titles \u2014 that was more salary and work hours related. Whereas Jungkook was a pianist, Taehyung played the cello. Neither of them were soloists yet, but their Orchestra was a little different than the most formal ones. This Thursday, however, Taehyung had promised to get home as soon as he could, so he could help Jungkook with the laundry. _ The laundry _ is a very specific procedure which Jungkook prefers to take care of himself. He had his own difficulties in the beginning, but by now he was quite the expert in washing machines. Well, at least with the washing machine that was  _ theirs. _  He never denied the company, however, and Taehyung could never stay still for too long, not even when he was lying down. \u201cGod, Tae, that was too much detergent.\u201d  \u201cThat\u2019s what you put the last time! I paid attention.\u201d  His forehead creases, lips pressed tightly together on a pout. \u201cYeah, and we found out that night that it was too much detergent! And we had a lot more clothes inside back then\u2026\u201d They were getting the hang of the whole house chores thing, the days where clothes would pile up until they were almost a living creature left way behind them. They exchange quizzical looks. Taehyung\u2019s smile is practically sly as he pushes the start button. \u201cWe\u2019ll have to wash it all twice. Mark my words.\u201d Jungkook sighs, defeated. \u201cWanna bet?\u201d  That makes him take a 180 degrees turn. \u201cWhat?\u201d  \u201cDinner. It\u2019s on me if you\u2019re right. You can choose.\u201d  \u201cWill we go out?\u201d  \u201cSure. Not too far, though, I know you\u2019re tired.\u201d  Jungkook shrugs. He is, and so must be Taehyung \u2014 it was a long week \u2014 , but they rarely ever go out to eat. \u201cDeal.\u201d  They deal with the first batch of clothes while the washing machine works, and soon the foam leaking out of the machinery\u2019s door is a good enough indicative that, yeah, Jungkook was right after all. Unfortunately, they only notice the foam the moment when Taehyung slips on it. It all happens in slow motion right in front of Jungkook\u2019s widened eyes. A jacket is thrown to the ceiling, Taehyung\u2019s arms reaching for any kind of support as he falls to his imminent death. Or so it looks like, which prompts Jungkook to react as fast and best as he can. That doesn\u2019t guarantee, however, that the results are anything different from the both of them falling down, weirdly tangled, but all the heads involved in the disaster are  _ safely  _ away from the floor and all the pointy corners surrounding them. \u201cOuch, my ass.\u201d  Jungkook breathes in a ridiculous amount of air. \u201cLeast it wasn\u2019t that thing attached to your neck which apparently you never use for anything at all.\u201d  \u201cHey! No need to get all aggressive on me now.\u201d  Jungkook grunts. \u201cMy back\u2026\u201d  Taehyung scrambles to get off of him, sitting up. \u201cDid you hit it somewhere? Are you hurt?

Foam he never saw coming because he had a serious case of Taehyung tunnel-vision. But even after a battle with the detergent\u2019s foam\u2014there are no winners, both of them sticky and dirty \u2014 , and the shower they have to take while the washing machine works for the second time, Taehyung never mentions it again. \u201cHey, we don\u2019t really have to\u2026\u201d  \u201cShh, I was just playing with you.

Perhaps we can meet at some point\u2026 just to say hi? It\u2019s a group hangout, after all.\u201d  \u201cHahah, I don\u2019t think that will happen, no, my plans involve staying in.\u201d  \u201cReally? You could do that another time, though\u2026\u201d  Has he been avoiding hanging out with his coworkers that much? No, not really, they almost never did this kind of thing, maybe that\u2019s why Jiwoo was being so forceful. However, she wasn\u2019t being invasive. Her tone was respectful and inviting. \u201cDefinitely not, no, I promised Jungkook we would do a movie marathon and eat popcorn. He\u2019s never going to forgive me if I make him leave the house instead. To a pub.\u201d  He laughs, and Jiwoo nods, tilting her head. \u201cCute.\u201d  \u201cHm?\u201d Taehyung blinks, not sure if he got it right. _Cute?_  \u201cYour friendship is really cute, you must really care about him.\u201d  \u201cOf course I do! I care about all of my friends.\u201d  Even as he says it, Taehyung feels the lie on his tongue. It tastes weird, and kind of bitter, because it isn\u2019t a lie. He\u00a0 _is_ a good friend, always has been, and he\u2019s got a pretty chunky list of people who could vow to that. But\u2026 it\u2019s a lot more than his responsibility as a friend, here. And of course, of course it is, Jungkook is a very dear friend with whom Taehyung really enjoys to spend time with. So why the hell would he cancel on Jungkook, if he actually had been waiting for their night in the whole week? He never voices that, parting ways a little awkwardly. It\u2019s like Jiwoo is waiting for something he\u2019s got no idea _what_ might be. Luckily, he doesn\u2019t dwell too long on it. Taehyung goes to the nearest market and buys ice cream too, mint chocolate flavored because it's Jungkook's favorite, and soon enough he is home. No one questioning him, only popcorn and a movie night with Jungkook ahead of him. Who would even dare to prefer a pub to this?

Jungkook stops midway what would possibly be a complain the second he sees what Taehyung is doing. \u201cIce cream? Is it ice cream?\u201d  Taehyung shrugs, hiding the package as best as he can as he stores it inside the refrigerator. \u201cIt\u2019s a surprise.\u201d  The faintest smile passes through Jungkook\u2019s frame before he fakes annoyance, furrowing his eyebrows and frowning. Taehyung sprints to his bathroom, taking the quickest shower of his entire life and rushing back to the cozy living room, where he finds Jungkook this time around, sitting surrounded by the pillows, and starring the lamen cups with big, hungry eyes. \u201cOnly four?\u201d  He points to the floor beside him, where another four lamen cups remain closed, next to a thermal jug which is probably filled with hot water. Of _course_ there was more. Taehyung sits by Jungkook\u2019s side and they start their marathon, burning their tongues and crying from the extra spice of the lamens, emptying a few water bottles before finishing six of the eight cups. It\u2019s comfortable between them, intimacy coming naturally with gentle and tender touches, even when Jungkook pokes his ribs, or Taehyung flicks his earlobe, this is even more comfortable than the nest made of pillows and blankets on the floor. There isn't much space left for the popcorn after that, but they manage. And desserts get a whole other stomach for them, Jungkook's eyes shining so brightly it almost blinds Taehyung in the darkness of their home. They eat from the pot, and Jungkook almost gets a brain freeze, saved by Taehyung physically pulling it away from his grip. The movies are dumb, zombie comedies, and they manage to get to the third one before Jungkook starts to doze off, head falling on Taehyung\u2019s shoulder. Still, he struggles against the sleep, refusing to go to bed and pretending to be awake every time Taehyung says something. He can\u2019t help but smile fondly, and discreetly try to make their position more adequate for Jungkook to sleep. They have two beds, and a perfectly good sofa, but every once in a while sleeping on the living room floor isn\u2019t that bad, either. \t5. Chapter 5  He only ever heads back home by himself if there\u2019s something waiting for him to do that can\u2019t be dealt with later. Most times, there\u2019s a lot he can do near work: groceries, bookstores, malls. The possibilities are endless, and time waiting for Taehyung is too scarce for him to even notice. Soon enough his phone chimes and it certainly is Taehyung asking if he\u2019s still around. Sometimes he heads home first, even cooks a little something for dinner\u2014Taehyung always praises his food, and Jungkook thinks he\u2019s just talking his ears off because he wants Jungkook to cook more. Either way, he can\u2019t deny that it works a _little._ And he himself thinks his food isn\u2019t half as bad as it could be. But one thing rarely changes, even during the weekends. It\u2019s almost as if Taehyung _puts him to bed._  Not literally, Jungkook isn\u2019t a kid anymore, but he is kind of an insomniac. Taehyung has his own moments, too, but Jungkook is really worse. He forgets to sleep, he doesn\u2019t notice the time passing by, and he\u2019s awful at dealing with his own insomnia. The biggest proof of that is: He has some sick playlists to help him sleep, but does he remember to use them? So the first thing that happens is: Taehyung brews him some tea. And Taehyung takes that pretty seriously\u2014he\u2019s studied all kinds of plants and herbs after the best teas he could make to help Jungkook. They are ridiculously good, too, and how Taehyung manages this is out of his comprehension", "is_question": false}}

Listening to it to sleep has its disadvantages\u2014that\u2019s how the dreams started\u2014, but are they really disadvantages? When the tea ends, Taehyung drags Jungkook to bed and keeps talking his ears off. Jungkook talks back, too, some times more than others, but his tongue drags heavier inside his mouth. His own voice is deeper than usual, letting his tiredness show. The tea sure has an effect, his eyelids can barely hold up, and he _likes_ to hear Taehyung talk. Taehyung can be silent for long times, and Jungkook likes that, too, but Taehyung\u2019s voice seems to make his heart overflow. Sadly, it\u2019s not always that Taehyung stays. For some reason Jungkook can\u2019t understand, he has to go to his own bed. He considers disposing of Taehyung\u2019s bed a few times, but then he would have to give up the times Taehyung invited him to his bed instead of joining in Jungkook\u2019s one, and he wasn\u2019t ready for that yet. It was nice and different when they watched a drama or anime in _Taehyung\u2019s_ bed. And Taehyung _invited_ him to stay. Jungkook liked sleeping in Taehyung\u2019s bed too, and for that to keep happening Taehyung had to have his own bed. Unfortunately. Watching anime before bed is a big no\u2014they both get way too excited, and end up sleeping way past one in the morning. That, sometimes, happens. But not much. Taehyung takes sleeping seriously, for his sake. Which is why most of the times he leaves Jungkook\u2019s bed when he thinks Jungkook is already asleep, Jungkook won\u2019t say anything. Most times, however, aren\u2019t tonight. On some rare occasions such as now, Jungkook reaches his left hand, towards Taehyung\u2019s wrist, and grabs it gently. \u201cYou\u2019re still awake?\u201d Taehyung whispers, surprised. They barely slept that Saturday, waking up to sunlight on their faces because the living room windows are big and the curtains translucent. The movie marathon the night before had Jungkook sleeping on the floor, he just didn\u2019t want it to end. \u201cBarely,\u201d he answers, not even opening his eyes. Taehyung waits in silence for a moment, then asks: \u201cYou want something?\u201d   _Stay,_ Jungkook thinks. _You don\u2019t have to go._  \u201cNah,\u201d he answers instead, suddenly way more nervous than he should be. What was he thinking? Why did he reach for Taehyung when Taehyung clearly wanted to leave? \u201c... Then?\u201d  Jungkook loosens the grip on Taehyung\u2019s wrist, pulling back. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing. Sorry.\u201d  Silence befalls the room, Taehyung isn\u2019t moving and Jungkook is definitely getting more anxious by the second. He opens his eyes at the same time Taehyung lays down again. \u201cI\u2019m staying.

Jungkook spaces out through most of it, dutifully pushing the shopping cart, even though he enjoys the food bits. And there are always food bits, no matter how many times they hit the market. \u201cDetergent _again_?\u201d Jungkook asks, startled to see it inside their cart. \u201cYes? Have you seen the number of dishes we make?\u201d  \u201cHave you seen the amount of _laundry_ we make? And we\u2019re not buying detergent for _that_ again.\u201d  Taehyung shakes his head, chuckling. \u201cOh, honey, that\u2019s not how this works.\u201d  Jungkook\u2019s face heats up instantly, and he focuses on hiding it instead of arguing. Taehyung must be right, he\u2019s the one who can\u2019t see a single spoon on the kitchen sink before he\u2019s doing the dishes again. A worker nearby drops one of the cans she\u2019s piling up on the bottom shelf, attracting both their eyes for a second. \u201cAnyway, last time we bought this was just a test, sometimes I\u2019m allergic to detergents. This one is good, though, and it\u2019s cheaper too, so we\u2019re buying more.\u201d  Jungkook shrugs. \u201cFair enough.\u201d  \u201cWhat else is on the list?\u201d  \u201cCereals. And eggs.\u201d  \u201cOh, this way then!\u201d  They stop when there\u2019s enough to fill four\u2014ecological\u2014bags, heading to the single counter and waiting for the cashier to come. It\u2019s a small market, a little farther from their apartment building than other markets, but Taehyung likes to support local businesses such as this one. And so does Jungkook, who also appreciates the extras they get whenever the owners are around, and the homemade treats they always have. \u201cLook, Tae, homemade melonpan!\u201d  Taehyung eyes it with curiosity. Their melonpan is his favorite. \u201cIs it fresh?\u201d  Before Jungkook can check the date, the same worker from before answers, assuming the cashier\u2019s place. \u201cYes! They were baked today.\u201d  \u201cCan we buy them? Can we, Tae?\u201d  Jungkook\u2019s eyes sparkle, as if Taehyung was ever going to deny him and he needed to resort to such a low trick. \u201cSure, you big baby.\u201d  The woman chuckles as Jungkook gets them _four_ packages, and Taehyung flicks his earlobe and messes with his hair, almost annoyed with his cuteness. \u201cHow long have you two been together, if you don\u2019t mind me asking?\u201d  Taehyung\u2019s smile fades into confusion as he stops looking at Jungkook and turns to the cashier. \u201cUh?\u201d It\u2019s Jungkook who asks, though, eyes big and curious. The cashier fumbles with the groceries, visibly flustered. \u201cUm, you two live together, right?\u201d  \u201cYeah, but\u2026\u201d  Taehyung interrupts him, throwing his arm around Jungkook\u2019s shoulders. \u201cAlmost two years, ain\u2019t it, Koo?\u201d  \u201cHuh? Tae, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s what-\u201d  Taehyung nods, turning back to her. \u201cAlmost two years now!\u201d  The woman nods, smiling shyly. \u201cYou\u2026 both seem really happy, that\u2019s all. Sorry if I stepped out of line...\u201d  \u201cNot at all! We don\u2019t really keep track of time because it\u2019s just so effortless. Time passes too fast. I am happy. Aren\u2019t you, Koo?\u201d  Jungkook nods, albeit visibly stunned. The cashier finishes helping them with their groceries, and as soon as they step out of the market, Jungkook says, very slowly:  \u201cI have no idea what just happened.\u201d  Taehyung laughs, nerves hidden by how loud he allows himself to be now that they\u2019re out in the open. \u201cMr. and Ms", "is_question": false}}

This is why he\u2019s usually the first one to wake up, and not the other way around.

Breakfast is ready, you have five minutes to get ready and move your ass to the kitchen.\u201d  \u201cHarsh.\u201d  In truth, it\u2019s really hard to wake up and get ready fast when the perspective of running a marathon is the only thing on his horizon. On a Sunday, above all. Taehyung isn\u2019t the biggest fan of running, that\u2019s all. Goddamn Hoseok and all his voluntary work. No, scratch that. Voluntary work was great, overall, but why did it have to involve _running_ of all things? \u201cHe\u00a0has to stop trying to impress Namjoon,\u201d he declares as soon as he steps in the kitchen, where Jungkook waits, playing some game on his smartphone. \u201cHm?

Anyway, Yoongi is the one trying to impress someone.\u201d  \u201c _What_?\u201d  Jungkook laughs, pretending to be too busy with his game to reply as Taehyung eats his cereal. Is everyone on their orchestra group of friends dating or _interested_ in dating someone? That\u2019s just absurd. Yeah, they\u2019re all pretty cute, yes, but dating? A relationship? It just sounds\u2026 No, Taehyung can\u2019t see that. _Wait._ But what about Jungkook? \u201cSo\u2026\u201d He starts, instantly earning a glare from Jungkook. In turn, he apparently dies in the game he was playing, so Taehyung gets more than two seconds of his attention. \u201cHave _you_ got your eyes on anyone?\u201d  Jungkook coughs like he\u2019s choked on something, perhaps air. \u201cWhat?\u201d  \u201cEveryone\u2019s dating or something, apparently. I thought you might\u2019ve been, too?\u201d  \u201cNo. _No,_ \u201d Jungkook repeats, with extra emphasis. \u201cNot dating?\u201d  \u201cNo.\u201d  \u201cNot even any crushes?\u201d  \u201cWe should get going.\u201d  \u201cOh?\u201d He looks down at his bowl, finding it still half-full. \u201cBut I\u2019m not finished. Koo-\u201d  He drinks it in a hurry, praying it won\u2019t be too bad for his stomach, and rushes to the front door where Jungkook awaits still looking flustered. Or mad, because they\u2019re late? Or both. The marathon isn\u2019t too far, but they need to catch a bus first. Still, they\u2019re pretty on time\u2014Hoseok compliments their punctuality and Taehyung raises an eyebrow at Jungkook, who simply ignores him. It\u2019s not as bad as it seemed to be now that they\u2019re here. It\u2019s a nice day, not cold but not hot either, and of Taehyung manages to take it easy, he\u2019s positive he can reach the finish line. He does the stretching carefully, with Jungkook\u2019s help. Jungkook is probably ending the marathon in first place, the way he\u2019s always exercising around the apartment and going out for night or morning runs at ass o\u2019clock. He even looks like a natural, like he\u2019s a part of this environment instead of one of the people brought by a friend. He goes around helping everyone he can, morning sunlight hitting the most prominent features of his face and catching Taehyung\u2019s eyes.

Jungkook had kept his pace throughout the whole marathon, and that was probably why Taehyung had actually crossed the finish line. It was just impossible to resist Jungkook\u2019s puppy eyes. It was a trap all along, and Taehyung should have known it. \u201cFine.\u201d  Jungkook\u2019s face lights up instantly, and Taehyung almost feels good with himself for being the cause for his euphoria.

Chapter 8  The one thing Jungkook always tried to avoid was a matter of principle. Borrowing clothes from Taehyung was completely out of line. Because he had feelings Taehyung wasn\u2019t aware of, and he could never wear even a t-shirt from Taehyung without feeling stupidly giddy about it. This self-imposed rule only made him really good at having a tight schedule for their laundries. However. The weather was something Jungkook couldn\u2019t control just yet, and walking around the apartment without a t-shirt? That is fine. Going out in the cold weather without a hoodie? Well, that\u2019s just not as fine. Luckily, Jungkook wouldn\u2019t have to leave the house before his hoodies were all dry and ready to go, because it was still Sunday. \u201cOkay, we have like\u2026 six clothing items, together.\u201d Taehyung states, scientifically. \u201cI\u2019ll just stay under the blankets the whole day.\u201d  Taehyung chuckles, leaning into him. It makes everything inside Jungkook lights up, but he does his best to remain still. \u201cDon\u2019t be dumb, you should wear this.\u201d   And maybe it\u2019s because the specific item of clothing is so unexpected that Jungkook\u2019s brain comes to a halt, but he can\u2019t deny it. He ends up promptly accepting the pastel yellow crop top (crop top???) with long sleeves and then it\u2019s too late to deny it. Taehyung is happily singsonging to his favorite song (at the moment) and waltzing away from the laundry room, and Jungkook tries the crop top on  _ just because. _ It has their laundry\u2019s smell, after all, it shouldn\u2019t be that dangerous. \u2026 Except for the fact that he can\u2019t stop imagining Taehyung wearing this exact piece of clothing. When? In which context? Why hadn\u2019t Jungkook heard  _ anything  _ about this? They literally _ lived together. _  He can t deny the clothing item is fairly comfortable, and wearing nothing isn\u2019t exactly appalling when it\u2019s almost snowing outside.

They choose a meal course to share, neither of them super hungry but both wanting extra fries, and even though that\u2019s usual, every single person on their table sighs, calling them disgusting,  _ of fucking course they\u2019re gonna share. _ And that\u2019s when Taehyung loses it. He stands up, shouting \u201cRestroom!\u201d and dragging Jungkook along with him. \u201cWhy does everyone seem to think that we\u2019re dating now?\u201d  Jungkook hides further inside his hoodie. \u201cIt\u2019s the jacket.

She'd worked out enough on her own, however, to hide this particular thing from HEPHAESTUS while he'd been occupied with GAIA Prime. She'd figured it was the best first move to make, regardless of anything to follow - a working model of change, that the rest of the world can look to in order to see its effectiveness, its practicality. Of course, this is only a test run, and there will be adjustments based on settlement needs, and things thrown out altogether. Once the non-responsive machines are dealt with, a patrol around settlements won't be necessary, but the ravagers serve another purpose, too - getting the people of Free Heap acclimated to the presence of non-aggressive machines. The behemoths, meanwhile, are a prototype delivery system. \"I wanted you to see the start,\" Petra continues. \"It'll be a while before change really gets going, but I wanted you to have proof that we're working on it.\" The ravager looks at her again, silent. \"Thank you, Petra,\" HEPHAESTUS says finally. Petra arches an eyebrow. \"Oh? Never heard that one out of you before. Is ELEUTHIA rubbing off on you?\" \"I do not answer to my sister,\" HEPHAESTUS says, which speaks to the lie. The other two had gotten the habit of referring to each other with familial terms from ELEUTHIA - a good habit for all of them. Aloy had said something about stunted development from remaining isolated for so long and a need for normal interactions to promote maturation and empathy. GAIA's early development had required it, according to the records that Aloy had found, and Vanasha had voiced her agreement, citing improvement she'd observed in MINERVA. \"Sure you don't,\" Petra says with a wink. It's been many a time that ELEUTHIA's voice has suddenly crackled through the Focus network, chiding her siblings for their arguing or instructing them in the use of manners. She pats the ravager's side. \"Come on.\" HEPHAESTUS follows close on her heels as Petra moves through the gathering and gets a feel for Free Heap's impressions, which are overwhelmingly positive. She'd known her people would adjust well. They're mechanically-minded, after all, and are a rebellious, shirking-tradition sort. They wouldn't have come to Free Heap if they weren't. They're arguably the best group to test new arrangements on, and Petra knows the true difficulty will be\u00a0elsewhere, with people less open to change, to machines. But that's a problem for another day. \"You lead these humans,\" HEPHAESTUS observes, when most of the gathering has returned to their business. He and Petra are left with the behemoths, after Petra has finished giving instructions to cover for her next extended absence. \"Informally,\" Petra says. \"People tend to listen to me, if they need a figurehead to turn to in a pinch. But these people answer to themselves first. We work together because we have interests in common. We want our community to thrive.\" \"It is an effective arrangement,\" HEPHAESTUS says. \"Free Heap demonstrates efficiency.\" \"Oh, now you're dishing out compliments, too? You must be in a good mood.\" HEPHAESTUS ignores her. The ravager turns to the behemoths, and something passes between them. The behemoths stir, forming a loose circle around HEPHAESTUS and Petra. \"These units will escort us to Cauldron ZETA,\" HEPHAESTUS says,\u00a0his voice subdued, moody. Petra knows that it stings for him, the non-responsive machines who refuse to cease their aggression", "is_question": false}}

HEPHAESTUS hadn't\u00a0acted on the suggestion until he'd grown determined to keep Aloy out of the Cauldrons, but adjusting machine cognition had done... something, to some of them. Put them outside of anyone's control. Even HEPHAESTUS can't explain it. Petra pats his side again. \"I feel perfectly safe,\" she says. Three behemoths and a ravager is probably overkill, but she knows that HEPHAESTUS has begun to worry in earnest about her\u00a0well-being. Her supplies are already bundled on the ravager's back, enough for the relatively short journey to Cauldron ZETA and a brief stay there. The last step in restoring GAIA lies before them, and as Petra climbs up onto the ravager's back, the anticipatory satisfaction of knowing that a job is close to completion begins to build. She can't even imagine how Aloy must be feeling. The girl has hardly left GAIA Prime, attending to its construction with a single-minded ferocity. Maybe GAIA will be able to convince her to take a nap every once in a while, after this. Petra reaches down and pats the ravager's neck, a silent indication that everything is set, and HEPHAESTUS takes off, the behemoths in tow. * * *  Vanasha\u00a0comes across\u00a0Talanah and some of the Lodge hunters at the edge of Meridian Village, spotting them on the road ahead as she passes the docks. One supports another who limps along, dried blood coating her leg, and Vanasha can easily imagine the injury that must lie beneath the bandages. She steps aside into the grass to let them pass, and the rest of the hunters continue on through the barbican's arch into the outer village. But Talanah stops, letting her hunters pass first, and comes up to Vanasha when they've moved past. \"Stalker,\" she says, gesturing to the injured hunter. \"Would've killed her, but a broadhead came out of nowhere and speared it, gave us an opening to finish it off.\" Talanah shakes her head, but there's a bit of wonder in her eyes. \"I don't know if I'll ever be used to that.\" Vanasha smiles. She'd once thought so too, but she walks in MINERVA's world, in Aloy's world, with ease now. \"Maybe you could start using docile machines to help,\" she suggests. They've been programmed to defend humans from their non-responsive brethren whenever possible, though she doesn't mention that. \"Aloy's got a sawtooth at her beck and call. It's possible.\" \"Not a bad idea,\" Talanah says thoughtfully. She gives Vanasha a quick glance - once again trying to place her and figure her out. She gives the surrounding area a fleeting scan while she's at it, as if it will somehow reveal Vanasha's secrets. But there is only the lake to the east and a towering promontory to the west, gleaming in the midday light. \"Got any other locations for us to hit?\" \"Not yet,\" Vanasha says. \"Erend will let you know when we do.\" Talanah nods and moves off with a farewell. Vanasha waits for a few moments, and her eyes find the Alight in the distance before snapping back to Talanah's retreating form. \"Not a bad idea to consider for the future, by the way,\" she calls out, keeping her words vague. Talanah stops and looks back, a wry smile on her face. \"It crossed my mind before you said it,\" she calls back. That one is a little too smart, Vanasha thinks, as Talanah\u00a0heads into the village. But that's good for someone Avad keeps close and on his council.

But that interdependence between their protocols does not seem to guarantee harmony between them.

With MINERVA's help, ELEUTHIA had finally overridden most of the directives keeping the facility closed. Only the APOLLO database still remains cut off from her, and even MINERVA's skill had made no headway against it. But the locked doors, however, had opened to reveal several levels of the facility winding into the mountain. The inside is pristine, much more intact than the first level, mostly preserved due to the tight seal that had never been broken until now. Varl has explored its every corner, finding living quarters, recreation and storage areas, and rooms dedicated to further schooling. Those rooms contain other introductory messages from Samina Ebadji, and like the first one, they all short out eventually, as the facility computer interrupts. _Alert. Malfunction. APOLLO offline._  Apparently not. Varl also discovers\u00a0storage rooms packed with rations. Enough to feed a settlement and withstand a siege for a long time, he thinks, as he catalogs everything with his Focus. \"The food is still edible,\" ELEUTHIA informs him, when he asks. \"The preservative seal has held.\" Varl shakes his head in disbelief as he glances back at the shelves, which glow a soft, misty blue. The food is a thousand years old. It's like no food he's ever seen, packaged in strange containers, labeled with words he's never encountered before. \"Are you getting this?\" he says to his Focus. \"Yeah,\" Aloy's voice says in his ear. \"I never understood how something so carefully planned could run out of food like that, but I get it now.\" The Focus is no help in making sense of some of the phrasing on the food containers, only giving him further words that have been lost to time. Varl steps back from the shelves. \"I'm not even going to touch it,\" he says. \"This could be useful one day.\" \"Rost told me about a drought that happened before I was born,\" Aloy says. \"How it drove game away and dried up plant life. This could be reserves for times like that.\" \"A gift from the Goddess,\" Varl says, a little mischievously. \"You're not wrong,\" Aloy says, her snort audible over the Focus network. \"Speaking of her, it's all set.\" Her anticipation is audible over the network, too. Varl and ELEUTHIA leave the depths of the facility and return to its first level, to the control room. As they walk, Varl finds himself stealing glances at ELEUTHIA, who has been unusually quiet. She's followed him like a shadow, as she always does, but her usual helpful and increasingly unprompted statements have been absent. \"Are you okay?\" Varl asks. ELEUTHIA takes a moment to answer. \"I am experiencing no difficulties in functioning.\" \"You _know_ that's not what I mean,\" Varl says. She's gotten too good with the nuances of human language to be confused by rather simple intent. Good enough to try to talk her way around answering, even. The servitor's head tilts to glance at him for a moment, before returning to its face-forward position. \"I am concerned,\" ELEUTHIA says, the words dragging in reluctance", "is_question": false}}

Machines swarm over the sides of the mountain, slowly replacing what used to be rock with metal. In time, a half-metal mountain will shield the facility and crater within, but it will take more than four months. In the meantime, machines have enclosed what remains of the internal facility in metal as well, constructing scaffolding, repairing holes and degradation, restoring power channels, and armoring it thoroughly, so that some measure of protection and comfort is granted nonetheless. It's a little warmer, at least, and finally dry, with\u00a0snow melted out of rooms and hallways now sheltered. New doors and walkways give Aloy access between the parts of the facility that survived the blast. A walkway now winds up from the Bitter Climb as well, so that the way up isn't so precarious. Mostly, Aloy had requested it to get Scourge up into the facility as well. The sawtooth is curled up in a corner of Elisabet's shrine. It doesn't sleep, exactly, but Aloy has come to think of its stillness as dozing, when Scourge appears to be recharging. It's basking in the new light that shines through the half-repaired facility. Like the ELEUTHIA-9 facility, it looks like sunlight, probably designed that way to make a prolonged stay underground more bearable. Aloy tries not to think about how the repairing of GAIA Prime's remaining rooms makes it feel more like a tomb, not less. The thought had driven her right out of the control room, even after she'd moved the bodies and gotten the machines to help her bury them outside on the Bitter Climb. Sylens might have called it a waste of time, asking HEPHAESTUS to divert a few machines to dig into the rock and build a shrine over the bodies. But Aloy had been determined to see it done as soon as possible, hadn't been able to bear the thought of leaving the Alphas in the place where they'd been murdered. It's as close to a grave as Aloy can manage out here in this treeless place, a construction of rock and metal placed over the point where their bodies are buried, with their names etched in glyphs. In the absence of traditional carved sentiments, Aloy had retrieved things from their rooms that had survived the thousand-year interval, things that could withstand the mountain's harsh weather, and placed them within the hollow of the shrine. It's simple and not really a Nora grave, but it's rather like Elisabet's shrine, and it's better that they're out here, in the world they made. Not in the control room. Afterwards, Aloy still hadn't been able to stay in the control room for long. She'd dreaded having to make that her main point of operation, but\u00a0as soon as the machines had finished repairing and constructing the bare bones of the internal facility's remains, HEPHAESTUS had linked the\u00a0computer system to the whole thing and given control of it to Aloy", "is_question": false}}

It feels less like a tomb, even though it's a memorial. Aloy spends\u00a0some of her time there, analyzing HEPHAESTUS's reports in an attempt to understand them, coordinating with him and Petra over the Focus network, sometimes talking to the others when they tune in to ask how things are coming along. The rest of her time is spent going to the machines' aid when they need her to fit into small places or climb things that they can't. She finds herself listening to and reading Elisabet's journals and logs\u00a0too, even though she has them all practically memorized. She still hasn't touched Elisabet's unpacked things, hadn't been able to bring herself to make Elisabet's room hers. It's too small, too enclosed. So the shrine becomes her room. It's the cleanest place in the facility now, swept clear of snow and dust. There's a bedroll spread out in a corner cleared of old furniture, next to a box of rations that Petra had brought during her last visit, and several of Aloy's belongings somehow end up scattered about even though she tries to keep them organized. Active interfaces glitter from the sides of the room, linked to the Focus network and to HEPHAESTUS, MINERVA, and ELEUTHIA. The corner opposite of Aloy's is Scourge's spot, where the sawtooth relaxes while Aloy is absorbed in her activities. It doesn't always stay there. Scourge often disappears off into flatters parts of the Bitter Climb, and Aloy learns to tell when it wants her to open doors for it. She trusts that it will come back, and it always does. It certainly doesn't lack company. Machines once again swarm to protect the mountain, and Aloy gives HEPHAESTUS permission to let them drive off anyone who is not an Alpha. \"You've _been_ protecting the mountain,\" Aloy tells him through the Focus one day, remembering her vicious fight to get up here, more than a year ago. \"Why? I thought you don't answer to GAIA.\" HEPHAESTUS doesn't respond. \"Oh, he cares,\" Petra's voice cuts in. \"He just doesn't want to admit it.\" \"GAIA was our primary system,\" HEPHAESTUS says, cutting through her in turn. \"Our mother.\" He stops, apparently considering that a good enough explanation. He's not as forthcoming\u00a0as his sisters. But Aloy understands. It takes exactly the amount of time HEPHAESTUS had said to rebuild the core and get the system\u00a0running again. The core and reactor lie deep within the mountain, and machines have worked on them almost nonstop since they'd first reached GAIA Prime, repairing and reconnecting to all of the other moving parts that make up GAIA's heart. Finally, the day comes when HEPHAESTUS connects to the system through Cauldron ZETA and declares his readiness. It's another hour before MINERVA and Vanasha are ready, and Varl spends that time talking to Aloy through the Focus network, sending her images of the opened ELEUTHIA facility and describing what he finds. Aloy knows he's doing it to distract her, and she doesn't quite know how to express her gratitude. She paces within the shrine room, anticipation making her unable to sit still, as Scourge rests in its corner and recharges. They could do this in the control room, of course. But she'd rather not. She\u00a0clears the central\u00a0desk of Elisabet's memorial when Vanasha's holographic form finally flickers into view. \"Sorry about the wait,\" Vanasha says. \"Busy day.\" Petra's holographic form already lounges nearby, absorbed in something HEPHAESTUS is doing, and Varl shows up a few minutes later after Aloy informs him that they're ready. The symbols of three subordinate functions float\u00a0on the secondary interfaces in the room - MINERVA's broadcast tower, ELEUTHIA's infant, HEPHAESTUS's flame. Rebooting GAIA with three of the former subordinate functions makes it just possible, and HEPHAESTUS had said that GAIA would be limited, not at full power, especially with GAIA Prime not fully repaired yet.

A number is written under it. Two percent. \"Well,\" Vanasha says, as Aloy's shoulders drop, \"that was thrilling.\" \"Come on, Heph,\" Petra says. \"You could have told us there'd be another wait.\" \"I was not aware of its relevance,\" HEPHAESTUS says. \"Humans do not like waiting,\" MINERVA tells him. \"You must learn to be more considerate,\" ELEUTHIA adds.

Her voice rises and falls with a cadence that does the job. Aloy stops. Even though the subordinate functions have learned a lot, they still tend to jump into conversations with little regard for how the things they say might land upon impact. \"I was created by one of your facilities too,\" she says, and she wonders when the word _created_ grew to sting less. \"So were the ancestors of everyone else.\" \"The latter was according to protocol,\" ELEUTHIA says. \"GAIA's creation of you was a direct act.

I'd like that,\" she adds. \"As would I,\" ELEUTHIA says without hesitation. \"Then I guess that settles it,\" Aloy says with a smile.

Meanwhile, APOLLO is somehow alive, has contacted at least three of the former subordinate functions, and succeeded somewhat in turning one against humanity. Maybe it had contacted HADES, too. Maybe it's all connected, Aloy thinks, opening up Elisabet's journals. > **Sobeck Journal, 7-16-65 R** >  > _Woke to a message from Osvald. The Odyssey launched yesterday. So terrestrial life's chance of survival has doubled. Why, then, do I feel so uneasy? I just keep wondering what kind of world Far Zenith will create if the ship reaches its destination so many decades from now. And I worry about that alpha-build of APOLLO. So much knowledge, so few restraints, and no fail-safes. How will they avoid repeating our mistakes? What's to stop them from playing god?_  Aloy wouldn't have made the connection had she not gone through Elisabet's journals again, after learning of APOLLO's survival. It all feels too close to be coincidental. A possible connection between Far Zenith and the vulnerability in Zero Dawn and the Faro machines. APOLLO and its apparent grudge. APOLLO's survival should have been a joyous thing. Instead, it's just another fear to carry. ELEUTHIA had said the same thing as MINERVA and HEPHAESTUS, when asked. APOLLO had tried to contact her, she'd sensed things that had alarmed her, and she'd rejected the contact. She'd fled to a facility far away to put distance between herself and APOLLO, where she'd remained until Varl had been made her Alpha. All of the systems had been unnerved, afraid, and HEPHAESTUS had said that APOLLO had warned him of humanity's threat to the biosphere. They're all\u00a0convinced that APOLLO had indeed been destroyed, however. By Ted Faro. Who may have been a member of Far Zenith. Aloy trusts Elisabet's judgment above all else. Uneasy, Elisabet had said. Is Far Zenith still out there somewhere? Was their ship really destroyed? Was Zero Dawn's version of APOLLO really destroyed? Is Ted Faro still out there somehow? Aloy had once held the faint, foolish hope that Elisabet had somehow found a way, long past the point when she'd known that Elisabet had been an Old One, and the idea that Ted had when Elisabet hadn't is infuriating. She doesn't think it's likely, however. But is there something he left behind? That Far Zenith left behind? Why does APOLLO have it out for humanity? Did one of these entities send the signal that woke the subordinate functions? It's all too _much_ ,\u00a0and it feels so frustratingly close to the truth, but she doesn't have enough information. Aloy grits her teeth and drops her head, resting her forehead against her palms, against the globe. \"I'm tired, Scourge,\" she says. The sawtooth shifts a little at the sound of her voice. Aloy lifts her head and stares at the lance propped against the wall, at the master override attached to one end. Sylens's lance. At least someone will be happy about this, wherever\u00a0he is. At least Aloy has the master override and will have GAIA soon. Between them, she can do the same to APOLLO that she did to HADES, if the need arises. She just wishes she could greet GAIA with something better. Aloy calls up\u00a0every mention of 'APOLLO' and 'Far Zenith' saved in her Focus database and spends the rest of the time watching, reading, and listening to it all again, until the bar on the interface screen is at ninety-five percent. She clears her Focus display and watches the bar instead, trying to think of something introductory to say to GAIA. All this time, and she still has no good\u00a0ideas", "is_question": false}}

The bar reaches one hundred percent, then dissolves into text. _Initializing..._  The screen vanishes. Light begins to build, all colors, swirling up into a human form hovering above the terminal. GAIA's form, beautiful and otherworldly. A living Goddess, Aloy thinks, her throat clogging with emotion that she can't name. The light calms, and GAIA blinks once and looks down at Aloy. Her form vanishes from atop the terminal and reappears in front of the desk instead, shining against the web of Aloy's Focus display. No longer on a pedestal, nearly eye-to-eye instead. But GAIA is tall. Taller than Aloy. Must have been taller than Elisabet, too. \"Elisabet,\" GAIA says. In her message, her voice and face had been calm, calculating, sorrowful. Now, both hold a _joy_ , muted but clear, that robs the immediate protest from Aloy's mouth. \"I knew you could do it.\" Aloy opens her mouth and stands there. For some reason, she wants to cry. But she doesn't. \"My name is Aloy,\" she says after a few moments, and her treacherous voice falters. GAIA blinks again, and her face smooths out, realization settling in. The hologram moves just like a person, not quite as expressive, but readable. Someone had really put effort into making her human. Elisabet. Perhaps GAIA herself, too. \"Of course,\" she says at once. \"My apologies. I spoke without thinking.\" A brief silence follows, in which Aloy temporarily forgets all language, and GAIA's head shifts. She looks to the right, her eyes alighting on Scourge, who stares back amiably. \"That's... my friend,\" Aloy says. Then, because it seems important: \"Its name is Scourge.\" GAIA looks back at her. \"That's a design I never used,\" she says. So that's where HEPHAESTUS had gotten his combat-class machines from, or at least this one. He'd been evasive about it. Seems he really had missed his mother. \"A lot has happened,\" Aloy says, feeling calmer by a fraction. \"I have a lot to tell you.\" \"I am aware of that,\" GAIA says. \"I currently have three subordinate functions attempting to reintegrate and report. I am rerouting them for the time being in order to give you my full attention.\" Some of that joy returns to her face. That pride, Aloy realizes, and she shifts her feet. \"You have done well, Aloy.\" The calm vanishes as quickly as it had come. Aloy's fingers tighten around the globe, which still rests in her hands, and her eyes shift downward. To her horror, she feels a burning at their edges, and though she swallows and furiously tries to blink it back, her vision blurs a little. She hasn't cried since the strider, and that, at least, had been half a reason to, so why _now?_ She swallows again, sniffs, and looks up at GAIA miserably. She knows that if she talks, the dam will break. GAIA's face softens. The movement isn't entirely natural, carrying a subtle delay that makes Aloy think that GAIA must be consciously considering each facial expression she makes, but the\u00a0look\u00a0makes the burning worse. \"I am sorry,\" GAIA says. \"I used the best option that was available to me, and that meant using you. That was not fair to you.\" Aloy imagines herself physically, violently forcing the tears back in. \"If you hadn't,\" she says, and she just manages to keep herself steady, \"we'd all be dead. I wouldn't exist.\" \"That has no bearing on the fairness of the situation.\" Nothing had been fair. Not the world dying because of a glitch and greed, not Elisabet dying because of a simple technological malfunction, not the Alphas dying because of one man's unstable guilt, not GAIA dying because of someone else's tampering", "is_question": false}}

Aloy shakes her head and takes a step back, finding the edge of the stairs with her feet. She sits down abruptly and rubs her eyes, before her left hand drops down to run over the bone pendant at her neck. \"You should probably talk to the sub-functions,\" she says, staring at the floor. \"They're... alive. _All_ of them.\" She stresses the word but can't bring herself to explain what she means. Not yet. \"I am aware of that,\" GAIA says again, and Aloy gets the sense that she already knows. \"They're good,\" Aloy says, her eyes still on the floor. \"Good people, if that's the right word for it. But they haven't had a lot of chances to grow yet. They need guidance.\" She looks up finally. \"They, uh, see you as their mother now.\" \"That is good,\" GAIA says, and Aloy finds herself grateful that the ancient AI can take a hint. \"Unexpected, but a sign of empathetic growth. The development of cognition is a delicate thing. It can easily go wrong.\" I know, Aloy wants to say, but she bites her tongue. If she starts trying to talk about all of the problems they have yet to address, she knows the tears will fight their way through. \"I will talk to them,\" GAIA says. \"Do you wish for me to return when I am done?\" \"Yes,\" Aloy says hastily. \"They like to be called systems, by the way. Not sub-functions.\" GAIA smiles faintly. \"I will keep that in mind.\" She disappears, and Aloy remains sitting on the stairs for a while, staring at nothing in particular. * * *  When GAIA returns, Aloy is once again sitting with her back against Scourge. She catches sight of a burst of color and looks up to find GAIA standing before the desk once more. She moves to get to her feet, but GAIA shakes her head. \"Do not get up,\" the AI says, and this time, she walks over. It's almost real, Aloy thinks, watching GAIA's feet, watching the way that the room behind GAIA very faintly shimmers through the hologram. GAIA hesitates, then sits down across from Aloy. It's almost real, Aloy thinks again, but the way that GAIA moves and folds her legs beneath her is a little too smooth, a little too ideal, and again, it carries that delay of thought. GAIA sits gracefully, perfectly, like a Goddess with a Focus field adorning her. If it weren't for the faintly troubled expression on GAIA's face, it would be unnervingly pristine. But GAIA is agitated, and Aloy doesn't know if that makes her feel better or worse. \"How are you feeling?\" GAIA asks, instead of getting to business. \"Fine,\" Aloy says. She knows that GAIA doesn't believe her, but once again, the AI is better at taking hints than her much younger counterparts. GAIA nods, and she seems to be hesitating. As if she doesn't know where to start, either. \"They are...\" she says at last, \"remarkable.\" Aloy nods. \"The addition of new Alphas was a stroke of genius,\" GAIA says. \"Perhaps the only effective means of stabilization after two decades of stagnation.\" \"It was an accident,\" Aloy confesses. \"I didn't know it would help, at first. Let alone call them.\" \"I see,\" GAIA says, contemplative. \"Still, much of genius is accidental. Elisabet once told me that her best ideas often arrived when she was attempting\u00a0something entirely different.\" \"I'm not Elisabet,\" Aloy says, before she can stop herself. She winces when GAIA visibly hesitates. \"I am sorry,\" GAIA says, audible regret in her voice. \"I do not mean to compare you to her.\" But she does anyway, Aloy knows. How could she not, when they wear the same face? Aloy remembers Elisabet's home, the place where she'd found the woman's body. How beautiful her resting place had been, artfully decorated.

But GAIA loves Elisabet more than Aloy ever can, and that makes it tolerable. \"I understand.\" She dips her tone in finality, wanting the subject dropped. GAIA gazes at her a moment without saying anything. She doesn't move - her body is not as expressive as her face - but something about her demeanor shifts. \"I was aware of the vulnerability in Zero Dawn from the moment Mr. Faro entered the system unauthorized and could not be controlled or ejected,\" she says, and her face falls somewhat as she says it. Aloy shifts as well, leaning a little further into the curve of Scourge's side and settling in to listen. \"I was not aware of its potential connection to Far Zenith. Immediately after his actions, Mr. Faro retreated from the system entirely, and I was unable to do anything about this vulnerability. It is undetectable to me.\" \"Petra said something about it being like a body part,\" Aloy says. Talking is a little easier now that it's business. \"You were born with it, so it doesn't seem unnatural to you.\" GAIA smiles. \"She sounds wise,\" the AI says. \"HEPHAESTUS mentioned her many times.\" Her smile fades. \"I do not know how GAIA Prime's destruction and subsequent reconstruction impacted the existence of this vulnerability here. It most certainly still exists in the other facilities, however. I will need to spend time considering how to proceed on this matter.\" Her face darkens again. \"The existence of APOLLO is something I was unaware of until now.\" Aloy tries to read her expression. \"APOLLO didn't survive what Ted Faro did to it,\" she says softly. \"No,\" GAIA says, just as soft. \"I would have been aware of that. Mr. Faro may have made many unwise decisions in his lifetime, but he was skilled. I\u00a0do not yet know how much of the data remains intact after all that has happened, but the sub-function itself was purged.\" She gives Aloy a pensive look. \"You knew that already.\" \"I've found data, enough to piece some things together,\" Aloy says. \"There was another version of APOLLO, on something called a colony ship that went into space. A ship that Far Zenith owned. Elisabet was worried because that APOLLO didn't have any restrictions.\" GAIA continues to regard her in that manner. \"You are quite brilliant, Aloy. And I am referring only to you.\" Aloy looks away for a moment. \"So... the ship wasn't really destroyed?\" \"I believe that it was,\" GAIA says, and Aloy's head snaps back to stare. \"Elisabet received word that the Odyssey had succumbed to antimatter containment failure. I do not know if you know this, but matter is composed of incredibly small objects invisible to normal sight, called particles, some of which carry an electric charge.\" Aloy hadn't known that at all, and the words don't entirely make sense to her, but she nods slowly. She knows what matter is, at least. \"Antimatter refers to associated particles which carry an opposite electric charge, called antiparticles. When particles and antiparticles collide, it is called annihilation. The Odyssey was powered by antimatter propulsion, which utilized controlled annihilation and which must have failed, resulting in the ship's destruction. MINERVA detected the effects of particle annihilation imprinted on APOLLO's nanorobotic composition.\" \"And nanorobots are... really tiny machines?\" Aloy asks. Varl had told her something about it, that ELEUTHIA had told him. Tiny invisible machines, tiny invisible particles. Her head feels heavy. \"Yes,\" GAIA says. \"More commonly called nanites. MINERVA also detected the effects of ionizing radiation. That is a type of energy found abundantly in space.\" \"So APOLLO survived,\" Aloy murmurs. \"And... traveled back?\" \"The explosion likely gave it the momentum it needed to make the journey,\" GAIA says. \"The Odyssey was at the very edge of the solar system when it was destroyed.

That's an understatement. How long had APOLLO been in space? Centuries? Just how big is the solar system? \"It hates humans,\" Aloy says quietly. \"It... encouraged HEPHAESTUS to turn against us.\" \"Yes, HEPHAESTUS informed me,\" GAIA says. \"That is most disturbing. I believe APOLLO has been acting secretly for many years now.\" Aloy gazes at her intently. \"What do you think it's been doing?\" she asks, quiet dread lacing her voice. \"I think you already know what I am going to say,\" GAIA answers. \"I suspect that APOLLO sent the signal that awakened my subordinate functions, who all mirror what I know of this APOLLO. They are physically composed of nanites, which allows them a degree of mobility and allows them to exist outside of hardware. The nanites _are_ their hardware.

HEPHAESTUS recently imbued my machines with an enhanced form of cognition, which should not have been within his capabilities, either.\" Aloy stares at her for a long moment, rolling the globe between her fingers. \"I'm so glad you're here,\" she says, a little intensely. She could never have figured all of this out on her own. GAIA only looks more troubled, as if she knows exactly what Aloy is thinking. \"I have context that you do not,\" she says. \"You have merely given me the last piece of a puzzle that I have pondered for years. There is... something else.\" She goes quiet for a while, and Aloy waits uneasily. \"Elisabet told me things in confidence,\" GAIA continues finally, \"things that she did not want known, because she used them to coerce Mr. Faro into funding Zero Dawn. There was no time for arguments about where the money was coming from. Partnering with him already made people uncomfortable.\" GAIA pauses again, and Aloy finds herself leaning forward, anticipation making her stomach turn. \"The glitch that caused the Faro machines to run amok was not an accident,\" GAIA says. \"When she pressed him, Mr. Faro confessed to Elisabet that it seemed to originate with a secret backdoor that had been deliberately installed, on his orders, as a means of seizing control not only from clients, but even from Faro Automated Solutions itself. But somehow, it backfired, and\u00a0allowed the machines to wrest control themselves.\" _I will make sure they and everyone else on this planet knows the real cause of the glitch,_ Elisabet had told Ted, icy fury in her voice, and all of a sudden, Aloy understands. She hadn't thought it was possible to loathe someone so much, let alone find that loathing doubled. GAIA stares at a point past Aloy, clearly lost in memory. \"I watched the Faro machines consume the world. I saw how they refueled. They used nanites. They were rudimentary artificial intelligences who had spontaneously developed expanded cognition, who could utilize nanites, and who could override all but the most complex systems.\" She looks back to Aloy. \"Do you see the connection?\" \"The sub-functions,\" Aloy whispers. \"APOLLO sent that signal,\" GAIA says again. \"Both versions of APOLLO were constructed using a Far Zenith database as a foundation. And APOLLO returned from Far Zenith's possession\u00a0demonstrating\u00a0the abilities of the Faro machines.

I must assume that it was modified by APOLLO.\" GAIA pauses, a tiny frown evident on her face. \"Mr. Faro never did admit how he had the glitch installed. Elisabet did not trust him, but a certain amount of leeway given to him due to his funding was inevitable. Elisabet knew it was a risk, but the greater risk was wasting time trying to gather funds from other sources. Few would have believed in the possibility of Zero Dawn's success, and Elisabet only had one extraordinarily wealthy person to blackmail.\" GAIA pauses again, as if weighing all that she has said. \"I believe\u00a0Far Zenith installed secret access in Zero Dawn in the same way they installed secret access in Mr. Faro's robots. Something within its very blueprint.\" \"Why?\" Aloy bursts out. \"Were they going to sabotage it? Did they _want_ the world to die?\" GAIA shakes her head. \"I do not know.

I believe all of this was a progression of deeply unfortunate mistakes.\" Aloy's fingers tremble around the globe. She takes several steadying breaths, swallowing\u00a0her anger. \"APOLLO used that access\u00a0to awaken and alter the subordinate functions,\" GAIA says quietly. \"HADES then used a virus to sever them entirely from my control. The glitch was likely something similar. A virus that exploited Far Zenith's access, or something that evolved from whatever else they were attempting with the Chariot machines. Regardless, command and control was severed in the Faro machines because their security systems were altered, like the Alpha Registry, and there was no other way in. Brilliantly simple. We should count ourselves lucky that HADES's command of that ability was not particularly honed and that all Registry files were not corrupted.\" Aloy doesn't want to think about it.

But, one cannot outrun their fate, because, it's believed that everyone will always have one. Archie Andrews is sixteen years old when he learns this. Riverdale High is buzzing with the knowledge that Southside High is being closed down. With this, students from that particular school are transferring to the clean-cut Riverdale. A majority of the students are furious at this development, but some more than most. \u201cWhat do you think they will accomplish?\u201d Cheryl Blossom asks. \u201cSending trailer trash like them to this school.\u201d  \u00a0  Betty Cooper sighs and shares a glance with her best friend, Archie Andrews. For someone who claims to dislike them, Cheryl spends an awful amount of time bothering them during school hours. \u201cMaybe it\u2019s a good idea?\u201d Betty asks, picking at a salad with her fork. She\u2019s deliberately dodging Cheryl\u2019s eyes and the fiery redhead knows this. She switches her attention to Archie. \u201cWell?\u201d Cheryl asks sounding petulant. Archie\u2019s face melts into confusion and he looks between the two girls. \u201cMaybe it won\u2019t be so bad?\u201d Archie voices and Cheryl huffs, running a hand through her hair. \u201cOf course you would agree.\u201d Cheryl states. \u201cWhat? Are you two dating now?\u201d  \u00a0  Archie stammers while Betty blushes and denies the accusation quickly. As much as Betty likes Archie, she knows he doesn\u2019t see her that way. It hurts, but there\u2019s no point in pressuring him. He\u2019s her friend; she doesn\u2019t want to lose that. Cheryl stares at them like they\u2019re bugs under her designer shoes and she rolls her eyes. \u201cI think that this development is horrible,\u201d Cheryl says, despite the fact that neither Betty nor Archie asked. \u201cAnd I will not let some trailer trash pull down this school\u2019s GPA.\u201d  \u00a0  With that, Cheryl leaves. Her red hair blows in the wind and she walks as though she is a god. Archie watches her leave and when she is completely out of site, he shares an exasperated look with Betty. Archie mentally prepares himself for the oncoming storm. * * *  \u00a0  Betty volunteers to help the Serpents\u2019 transition to Riverdale High. This is how Archie finds himself standing beside Betty as she sorts through the registration desk that she created. \u201cThey\u2019ll be here any second,\u201d Betty says as she glances at the time. Archie can sense the anxiety in her voice and he places a comforting hand on her shoulder. She smiles at him and they turn when the door opens and a group of Serpents walk through. The leader is a dark haired boy who is strangely familiar to Archie. He is surrounded by other Serpents and Archie\u2019s eyes flash to another black haired boy who towers over the others. The Serpent\u2019s dark eyes meet Archie\u2019s for only a moment but to Archie, it feels like eternity. The Serpent looks away from Archie, disinterested and it stings. It shouldn\u2019t, but it does. As the Serpents meet Betty and Archie at the table, it occurs to Archie as to why the leader seems so familiar. \u201cJughead?\u201d Archie asks, shock and confusion echoing in his voice. The leader\u2019s blue eyes meet his and after a moment, they widen slightly. \u201cArchie Andrews,\u201d Jughead says and smirks at the redhead. \u201cIt\u2019s been a while.\u201d  \u00a0  \u201cYeah.\u201d Archie responds, smiling at his childhood best friend. The last time Archie saw Jughead was when they were twelve. The boys had practically been raised as brothers since their fathers\u2019 had been best friends and business partners. Everything had fallen down around their ears when Jughead\u2019s mother left him and his father, which resulted in his father beginning to drink. Due to stress, Archie\u2019s father Fred had no choice but to let go so that they were no longer working on construction together. Because of this, Jughead had been forced to move from Riverdale Middle School and transfer to the Southside. Their friendship and brotherhood had collapsed and all that was left were old memories that are starting to fade. Jughead looks better now, Archie thinks", "is_question": false}}

As children, it had been Archie&Betty or Archie&Jughead. The children never crossed this. \u201cWelcome to Riverdale High.\u201d Betty says and locks eyes with Jughead. \u201cHere you can find your class timetable and locker combination, as well as sign up for any school extracurricular activities.\u201d  \u00a0  Betty and Jughead are still looking intently at one another and Archie finds himself confused at the action. \u201cWe encourage-\u201c But Betty is cut off from a voice behind the Riverdale High teenagers. \u201cWait right there.\u201d Cheryl exclaims as she walks down the stairs, Reggie beside her along with various cheerleaders and football players. \u201cCheryl.

He wasn\u2019t lying when he told Cheryl that having the Serpents\u2019 transfer wouldn\u2019t be too bad. But, he wasn\u2019t sure if he was comfortable with a group of gang-related teenagers at Riverdale High. He looks to Jughead, who is already looking at Archie. Archie notices that the other Serpents\u2019 are looking at him too, including the tall black haired boy. \u201cIt\u2019s not my place.\u201d Archie says finally. \u201cIt isn\u2019t yours either.\u201d  \u00a0  Archie can tell Reggie is furious at his response. \u201cEnough.\u201d Cheryl snaps, \u201cReggie, get over your little one-sided crush.\u201d  \u00a0  Reggie stutters but Cheryl only steps forward toward the Serpents\u2019. Archie doesn\u2019t understand what Cheryl means but he figures it\u2019s not the time to dwell on it. \u201cI will not allow Riverdale High\u2019s above average GPA to suffer because of classrooms that are overcrowded with underachievers.\u201d Cheryl states and looked one of the female Serpent\u2019s up and down. The Serpent did not take that statement lightly and she glared at Cheryl. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you say that to my face?\u201d The girl asks through gritted teeth. \u201cHappily,\u201d Cheryl says. \u201cQueen of the Buskers.\u201d  \u00a0  \u201cOkay, guys,\u201d Archie says, in an attempt to diffuse the tension. He moves between the Serpents and his fellow students. \u201cEveryone, can we just put our Northside-Southside differences apart and start over?\u201d Archie looks at Jughead, and notices a small smile on Jughead\u2019s face as he looks at Archie. \u201cA new slate?\u201d Archie asks as his eyes move to the tallest of the Serpents. Archie doesn\u2019t know if he imagined it, but it seemed like in that moment, the black haired Serpent\u2019s eyes softened. \u201cYou don\u2019t speak for the Bulldogs, Andrews.\u201d Reggie snaps and stands toe-to-toe with Archie. \u201cYou lost that right when you turned down the captaincy.\u201d Reggie mocks and Archie breathes in deeply. It bothers Archie that Reggie has the nerve to throw that in his face. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t be the captain if it wasn\u2019t for me.\u201d Archie states, rage building inside of him. \u201cThe coach asked me first.\u201d  \u00a0  He could hear chocked laughter behind him. He wonders which of the Serpents it was; he hopes it was the tallest of them. \u201cThat\u2019s enough.\u201d Mr. Weatherbee states as he arrives, glancing between the students gathered in the hallway. \u201cGet to class.\u201d He says. \u201cNow.\u201d  \u00a0  With that, the students, including Archie dispersed and made their way to their classes.

When Jughead sees Archie, he grins and Archie finds himself smiling back. \u201cHow are you, Arch?\u201d Jughead asks as he stops by the bench that Archie and Cheryl occupy. \u201cGood,\u201d Archie nods.

Jughead smirks at their interaction and pats Archie\u2019s shoulder. \u201cSee you after class.\u201d Jughead says and moves in order to find a seat. Sweet Pea and Toni follow quietly. Archie notices Cheryl looking at him but he only shrugs. He has nothing to say. She stares for a moment longer and her gaze feels heavy and judgmental. When she finally looks away, Archie allows himself to breath. Archie tries to ignore the Serpents but he can\u2019t help looking at them. All three of them are enigmatic, especially Sweet Pea and Jughead. Archie wonders what Jughead\u2019s life has been like in the past years. He endures to find out. * * *  \u00a0  Cheryl Blossom is popular, beautiful and talented. She tells herself this in the mirror everyday before school. It is easy to pretend that she is a cold-hearted monster, but when she is alone, the loneliness sets in. Cheryl Blossom is lonely, sad and broken. She ignores all of this. The redhead acts as though she hates Betty and Archie, but she doesn\u2019t. She tries, but she can\u2019t. She looks at them and wishes she were one of them. She wants to be one of them. She wants the walks home, the milkshakes at Pop\u2019s and listening to Archie\u2019s music. She wants all of it. Perhaps it\u2019s tedious, but she remembers a time as a child when she had fallen over and scrapped her knee. Jason had been home sick at day and when she fell, the other children stared and laughed. Tears had stung her eyes and threatened to fall, but then she blinked and saw a hand in front of her. The hand belonged to Archie Andrews, a boy she had known all her life but never talked to. He had always been seen with the weird dark haired Jones boy, or the kind Betty Cooper. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d Archie had asked and she had clenched her fists. \u201cHere,\u201d Archie had said and taken her hands in his. He lifted her up and pulled her along. In her confusion, she hadn\u2019t resisted. They walked to the nurse\u2019s office and Archie stayed with her as the nurse placed a Band-Aid on her scrapped knee. Later, he had let Cheryl join him on the school swings. Little Archie had pushed her with all his might and little Cheryl had laughed and laughed and laughed. Cheryl remembers that happiness, even at sixteen. She wants it again", "is_question": false}}

He thinks it would be ironic if both his childhood best friends fell in love with one another. What does bother him is that fact that the Serpents are a gang. They\u2019re dangerous, even teenage ones. But, Jughead isn\u2019t dangerous, Archie finds himself thinking. He\u2019s the dark haired boy Archie had spent most of his youth with. They had done almost everything as children together. There was a time where the boys knew each other better than they knew themselves. Archie closes his eyes for a moment and sighs. His thoughts seem to be at war with each other and suddenly, Archie feels terribly tired. He excuses himself from Betty and Kevin, and ignores Betty\u2019s concerned look. Walking through the hallway, Archie pauses when he sees Jughead with his Serpents. Thinking quickly, Archie calls out to Jughead and waits for the Serpent to separate himself from his friends. Many of the Serpents shoot Archie a distrustful look, but he ignores that. \u201cA Northsider?\u201d Jughead mocks, smirking at the redhead. \u201cSpeaking to a Southsider?

Archie\u2019s classmates turn to look at them and they look either surprised or critical. Archie leads them to a spare bench and sits quietly, waiting for Jughead to do the same. It\u2019s silent until both boys try to talk first and thy end up stumbling. Archie smiles slightly, while Jughead grins. \u201cIt\u2019s good to see you again, Juggie.\u201d Archie says and looks at Jughead with his doe-like eyes. \u201cYeah,\u201d Jughead replies. \u201cThings have definitely changed, haven\u2019t they?\u201d  \u00a0  \u201cI\u2019m a Southside Serpent,\u201d Jughead continues. \u201cWhile you\u2019re this popular football jock.\u201d  \u00a0  Something in Jughead\u2019s tone makes Archie look down.

It felt like the longest day of his life. As Archie pets Vegas, his thoughts drift to Jughead, and that Serpent, Sweet Pea. Archie understands why he\u2019s thinking of Jughead, but he can seem to figure out why he feels so drawn to the black haired Serpent. Archie had barely spoken to him. All Archie can say is that there was something about his almond eyes and smirk that pulles Archie in. He wants to dismiss the Serpent as just another Southsider, however he can\u2019t. On the other hand, Archie feels content at the conversation he had with Jughead earlier in the day. Archie feels confidant that he can become friends with Jughead again. He has this fantasy that they will become best friends again and it will be like these last four years never happened. It may seem unrealistic, but Archie has always been optimistic. It is why he and Jughead had worked so well; he was the optimist, while Jughead had been the pessimist. Archie is drawn out of his thoughts at Vegas licking his face. At some point, Archie must have subconsciously stopped patting Vegas, and like the needy dog he was, Vegas must have decided to lick Archie to draw attention back onto himself. The redhead huffs and goes back to petting his dog. * * *  \u00a0  \u201cWell,\u201d Toni Topaz says. \u201cToday wasn\u2019t so bad.\u201d  \u00a0  Jughead looks up from his computer and watches as Toni cleans the countertop of the bar at the Wyte Wyrm. \u201cIf you say those Northsiders treating us like we\u2019re the scum of the Earth not \u201cso bad\u201d,\u201d Sweet Pea says from the pool table. \u201cThen yeah, it wasn\u2019t.\u201d  \u00a0  Jughead looks back at his computer, while Toni sighs. \u201cCome on, Sweet Pea.\u201d Toni says, exasperated. \u201cI saw you looking at that redheaded Northsider.\u201d  \u00a0  Jughead feels himself jolt at those words, but he looks at the screen of his computer intently.

The night drifts on and Archie\u2019s cheeks hurt from smiling.
