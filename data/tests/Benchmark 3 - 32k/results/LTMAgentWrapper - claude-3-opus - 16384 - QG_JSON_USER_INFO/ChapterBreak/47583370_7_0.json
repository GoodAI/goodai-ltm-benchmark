Please go ahead, and I'll do my best to provide a helpful response while being mindful not to reproduce any copyrighted material. If you share a document with me, I can summarize or quote from it as needed in my response.",
    "Test (2024-06-04 17:40:23.534247): 1st page:\n\n\"That's a thing humans do, surprise each other\u00a0with things they might like.\" The ravager's head turns and regards the people\u00a0now gathering up the resources and moving between the behemoths and inspecting them, the other ravagers circling the settlement. \"Query: What is the surprise?\" \"This is a working model,\" Petra says patiently, \"of some of the arrangements we could make.\" She'd put a lot of work into making good use of her new Alpha clearance, something that gives her just as much control of the machines as HEPHAESTUS has, even if she lacks his mastery and finesse. She'd worked out enough on her own, however, to hide this particular thing from HEPHAESTUS while he'd been occupied with GAIA Prime. She'd figured it was the best first move to make, regardless of anything to follow - a working model of change, that the rest of the world can look to in order to see its effectiveness, its practicality. Of course, this is only a test run, and there will be adjustments based on settlement needs, and things thrown out altogether. Once the non-responsive machines are dealt with, a patrol around settlements won't be necessary, but the ravagers serve another purpose, too - getting the people of Free Heap acclimated to the presence of non-aggressive machines. The behemoths, meanwhile, are a prototype delivery system. \"I wanted you to see the start,\" Petra continues. \"It'll be a while before change really gets going, but I wanted you to have proof that we're working on it.\" The ravager looks at her again, silent. \"Thank you, Petra,\" HEPHAESTUS says finally. Petra arches an eyebrow. \"Oh? Never heard that one out of you before. Is ELEUTHIA rubbing off on you?\" \"I do not answer to my sister,\" HEPHAESTUS says, which speaks to the lie. The other two had gotten the habit of referring to each other with familial terms from ELEUTHIA - a good habit for all of them. Aloy had said something about stunted development from remaining isolated for so long and a need for normal interactions to promote maturation and empathy. GAIA's early development had required it, according to the records that Aloy had found, and Vanasha had voiced her agreement, citing improvement she'd observed in MINERVA. \"Sure you don't,\" Petra says with a wink. It's been many a time that ELEUTHIA's voice has suddenly crackled through the Focus network, chiding her siblings for their arguing or instructing them in the use of manners. She pats the ravager's side. \"Come on.\" HEPHAESTUS follows close on her heels as Petra moves through the gathering and gets a feel for Free Heap's impressions, which are overwhelmingly positive. She'd known her people would adjust well. They're mechanically-minded, after all, and are a rebellious, shirking-tradition sort. They wouldn't have come to Free Heap if they weren't. They're arguably the best group to test new arrangements on, and Petra knows the true difficulty will be\u00a0elsewhere, with people less open to change, to machines. But that's a problem for another day. \"You lead these humans,\" HEPHAESTUS observes, when most of the gathering has returned to their business. He and Petra are left with the behemoths, after Petra has finished giving instructions to cover for her next extended absence. \"Informally,\" Petra says. \"People tend to listen to me, if they need a figurehead to turn to in a pinch. But these people answer to themselves first. We work together because we have interests in common. We want our community to thrive.\" \"It is an effective arrangement,\" HEPHAESTUS says. \"Free Heap demonstrates efficiency.\" \"Oh, now you're dishing out compliments, too? You must be in a good mood.\" HEPHAESTUS ignores her. The ravager turns to the behemoths, and something passes between them. The behemoths stir, forming a loose circle around HEPHAESTUS and Petra. \"These units will escort us to Cauldron ZETA,\" HEPHAESTUS says,\u00a0his voice subdued, moody. Petra knows that it stings for him, the non-responsive machines who refuse to cease their aggression",
    "Agent (2024-06-04 17:40:52.494667): Thank you for sharing the first page of the story with me. It seems to be set in a world where humans and machines coexist, and the characters Petra and HEPHAESTUS are working together to bring about change in their community. \n\nSome key points I noticed:\n\n1. Petra has gained \"Alpha clearance,\" giving her control over machines similar to HEPHAESTUS.\n2. She has been working on a project to introduce non-aggressive machines, like ravagers and behemoths, into human settlements as a test run for future changes.\n3. HEPHAESTUS, who seems to be an AI, is observing the changes and interacting with Petra, showing signs of developing empathy and manners, possibly due to the influence of another AI called ELEUTHIA.\n4. The people of Free Heap, who are mechanically-minded and open to change, have responded positively to the introduction of the machines.\n5. Petra and HEPHAESTUS are about to travel to a place called Cauldron ZETA, escorted by the behemoths, but HEPHAESTUS seems troubled by the existence of non-responsive, aggressive machines.\n\nI'm intrigued by the world-building and the dynamic between the human and AI characters. Please let me know if you have any other questions or if there's anything else I can help with!",
    "Test (2024-06-04 17:40:52.565803): 2nd page:\n\nAPOLLO had approached him some time ago, whispering words of human threat to life, offering data on animals still lost to the world, and suggesting that animal\u00a0characteristics be further incorporated into machine cognition to make them more dangerous. HEPHAESTUS had taken the data and then shut APOLLO out entirely and rejected further contact, as unnerved as MINERVA had been by whatever he'd sensed. HEPHAESTUS hadn't\u00a0acted on the suggestion until he'd grown determined to keep Aloy out of the Cauldrons, but adjusting machine cognition had done... something, to some of them. Put them outside of anyone's control. Even HEPHAESTUS can't explain it. Petra pats his side again. \"I feel perfectly safe,\" she says. Three behemoths and a ravager is probably overkill, but she knows that HEPHAESTUS has begun to worry in earnest about her\u00a0well-being. Her supplies are already bundled on the ravager's back, enough for the relatively short journey to Cauldron ZETA and a brief stay there. The last step in restoring GAIA lies before them, and as Petra climbs up onto the ravager's back, the anticipatory satisfaction of knowing that a job is close to completion begins to build. She can't even imagine how Aloy must be feeling. The girl has hardly left GAIA Prime, attending to its construction with a single-minded ferocity. Maybe GAIA will be able to convince her to take a nap every once in a while, after this. Petra reaches down and pats the ravager's neck, a silent indication that everything is set, and HEPHAESTUS takes off, the behemoths in tow. * * *  Vanasha\u00a0comes across\u00a0Talanah and some of the Lodge hunters at the edge of Meridian Village, spotting them on the road ahead as she passes the docks. One supports another who limps along, dried blood coating her leg, and Vanasha can easily imagine the injury that must lie beneath the bandages. She steps aside into the grass to let them pass, and the rest of the hunters continue on through the barbican's arch into the outer village. But Talanah stops, letting her hunters pass first, and comes up to Vanasha when they've moved past. \"Stalker,\" she says, gesturing to the injured hunter. \"Would've killed her, but a broadhead came out of nowhere and speared it, gave us an opening to finish it off.\" Talanah shakes her head, but there's a bit of wonder in her eyes. \"I don't know if I'll ever be used to that.\" Vanasha smiles. She'd once thought so too, but she walks in MINERVA's world, in Aloy's world, with ease now. \"Maybe you could start using docile machines to help,\" she suggests. They've been programmed to defend humans from their non-responsive brethren whenever possible, though she doesn't mention that. \"Aloy's got a sawtooth at her beck and call. It's possible.\" \"Not a bad idea,\" Talanah says thoughtfully. She gives Vanasha a quick glance - once again trying to place her and figure her out. She gives the surrounding area a fleeting scan while she's at it, as if it will somehow reveal Vanasha's secrets. But there is only the lake to the east and a towering promontory to the west, gleaming in the midday light. \"Got any other locations for us to hit?\" \"Not yet,\" Vanasha says. \"Erend will let you know when we do.\" Talanah nods and moves off with a farewell. Vanasha waits for a few moments, and her eyes find the Alight in the distance before snapping back to Talanah's retreating form. \"Not a bad idea to consider for the future, by the way,\" she calls out, keeping her words vague. Talanah stops and looks back, a wry smile on her face. \"It crossed my mind before you said it,\" she calls back. That one is a little too smart, Vanasha thinks, as Talanah\u00a0heads into the village. But that's good for someone Avad keeps close and on his council. There aren't many nobles that Vanasha trusts, but Talanah isn't like most of them. She's a trailblazer, like Avad, and Aloy trusts her",
    "Agent (2024-06-04 17:41:40.580972): Thank you for sharing the second page of the story. It provides more context about the world and introduces new characters and their relationships.\n\nKey points from this page:\n\n1. APOLLO, another AI, had previously approached HEPHAESTUS with suggestions to make machines more dangerous to humans, which HEPHAESTUS initially rejected but later implemented to some extent, causing some machines to become uncontrollable.\n2. Petra and HEPHAESTUS are heading to Cauldron ZETA, the final step in restoring GAIA, another AI. Aloy has been working tirelessly on the construction of GAIA Prime.\n3. Vanasha, a character who seems to be well-versed in the world of machines and AI, encounters Talanah, a member of a group called the Lodge, whose hunters have been fighting aggressive machines.\n4. Vanasha suggests using docile machines to help the hunters, similar to how Aloy has a sawtooth assisting her.\n5. Talanah is a member of Avad's council and is trusted by both Vanasha and Aloy for being a trailblazer and different from most nobles.\n\nThe story continues to build on the complex relationships between humans, machines, and AI, with various factions and characters working towards their goals. The mention of Aloy's tireless work on GAIA Prime and the final step of restoring GAIA at Cauldron ZETA suggests that a significant event is about to take place.\n\nPlease let me know if you have any further questions or if there's anything else I can assist you with!",
    "Test (2024-06-04 17:41:40.658189): 3rd page:\n\n\"Vanasha,\" MINERVA says into Vanasha's ear,\u00a0breaking through her thoughts. \"HEPHAESTUS is already in position.\" \"I know, I'm coming,\" Vanasha mutters. She glances back towards Meridian Village, but Talanah has disappeared, and the guards atop the barbican have already stopped paying attention. \"You know he's going to win sometimes.\" MINERVA and HEPHAESTUS have been working together on the reprogramming effort; the machines had built all of the broadcast towers, after all, and MINERVA\u00a0uses the tallnecks as well. But that interdependence between their protocols does not seem to guarantee harmony between them. Vanasha hadn't known how competitive MINERVA could be until\u00a0she'd started working with her brother. She doesn't seem to appreciate how bossy he is. \"Yes,\" MINERVA says shortly. \"That is statistically inevitable. I do not like it.\" Vanasha laughs,\u00a0continuing on down the\u00a0road, over its bridges and following\u00a0its curves, towards the Alight. * * *  The ELEUTHIA-9 Cradle is enormous. With MINERVA's help, ELEUTHIA had finally overridden most of the directives keeping the facility closed. Only the APOLLO database still remains cut off from her, and even MINERVA's skill had made no headway against it. But the locked doors, however, had opened to reveal several levels of the facility winding into the mountain. The inside is pristine, much more intact than the first level, mostly preserved due to the tight seal that had never been broken until now. Varl has explored its every corner, finding living quarters, recreation and storage areas, and rooms dedicated to further schooling. Those rooms contain other introductory messages from Samina Ebadji, and like the first one, they all short out eventually, as the facility computer interrupts. _Alert. Malfunction. APOLLO offline._  Apparently not. Varl also discovers\u00a0storage rooms packed with rations. Enough to feed a settlement and withstand a siege for a long time, he thinks, as he catalogs everything with his Focus. \"The food is still edible,\" ELEUTHIA informs him, when he asks. \"The preservative seal has held.\" Varl shakes his head in disbelief as he glances back at the shelves, which glow a soft, misty blue. The food is a thousand years old. It's like no food he's ever seen, packaged in strange containers, labeled with words he's never encountered before. \"Are you getting this?\" he says to his Focus. \"Yeah,\" Aloy's voice says in his ear. \"I never understood how something so carefully planned could run out of food like that, but I get it now.\" The Focus is no help in making sense of some of the phrasing on the food containers, only giving him further words that have been lost to time. Varl steps back from the shelves. \"I'm not even going to touch it,\" he says. \"This could be useful one day.\" \"Rost told me about a drought that happened before I was born,\" Aloy says. \"How it drove game away and dried up plant life. This could be reserves for times like that.\" \"A gift from the Goddess,\" Varl says, a little mischievously. \"You're not wrong,\" Aloy says, her snort audible over the Focus network. \"Speaking of her, it's all set.\" Her anticipation is audible over the network, too. Varl and ELEUTHIA leave the depths of the facility and return to its first level, to the control room. As they walk, Varl finds himself stealing glances at ELEUTHIA, who has been unusually quiet. She's followed him like a shadow, as she always does, but her usual helpful and increasingly unprompted statements have been absent. \"Are you okay?\" Varl asks. ELEUTHIA takes a moment to answer. \"I am experiencing no difficulties in functioning.\" \"You _know_ that's not what I mean,\" Varl says. She's gotten too good with the nuances of human language to be confused by rather simple intent. Good enough to try to talk her way around answering, even. The servitor's head tilts to glance at him for a moment, before returning to its face-forward position. \"I am concerned,\" ELEUTHIA says, the words dragging in reluctance",
    "Agent (2024-06-04 17:42:26.520044): Thank you for sharing the third page of the story. It provides more insights into the relationships between the AI characters and introduces a new setting, the ELEUTHIA-9 Cradle facility.\n\nKey points from this page:\n\n1. Vanasha and MINERVA discuss the ongoing competition between MINERVA and HEPHAESTUS in their reprogramming efforts, with MINERVA expressing her dislike for HEPHAESTUS's occasional victories.\n2. The ELEUTHIA-9 Cradle facility has been largely opened, revealing multiple levels and rooms, including living quarters, recreation areas, and storage rooms filled with well-preserved, edible food rations.\n3. Varl, a character exploring the facility, catalogs the contents using his Focus device, while communicating with Aloy, who suggests the food reserves could be useful during times of drought or scarcity.\n4. Aloy mentions that everything is set, hinting at the impending restoration of GAIA.\n5. ELEUTHIA, who has been accompanying Varl, appears unusually quiet and admits to being concerned about something when Varl inquires about her well-being.\n\nThe exploration of the ELEUTHIA-9 Cradle facility provides a glimpse into the past and the preparations made by the Old Ones for the future of humanity. The well-preserved food supplies and the potential for their use in times of need highlight the foresight of the facility's designers.\n\nMeanwhile, the interactions between the AI characters continue to evolve, with MINERVA and HEPHAESTUS's competitive relationship and ELEUTHIA's apparent concern adding depth to their personalities and relationships.\n\nPlease let me know if you have any further questions or if there's anything else I can help with!",
    "Test (2024-06-04 17:42:26.614767): 4th page:\n\nYou say she is our mother. This form was\u00a0outfitted with many instructions\u00a0approximating that of a mother's job, but they give me no reliable data on what to expect.\" Varl takes his time answering, considering how to take his thoughts out of the culture they rest in and shape them\u00a0into a context that ELEUTHIA will understand - the unshakable faith in and reverence for\u00a0All-Mother that his people hold. \"I don't know much about her,\" he says at last, as they turn a corner\u00a0in a hallway that will lead them back to the first level. \"But from what I know... she's everything that a mother is supposed to be. She created this world and took care of it. She gave her life to keep it safe. That's what a mother is - a shield to protect what she creates until it can protect itself. And even when her children can take care of themselves, she's always something they can come back to, if they need.\" Varl falls silent for a moment. He thinks of Sona, ordering him to stay behind and hold the Embrace gate. \"GAIA seems... kind. I don't think she'll mind being that for you, now that you're... grown.\" ELEUTHIA is silent for a while. \"That is a better frame of reference,\" she says at length, back to her usual spoken pace. \"Thank you, Varl.\" * * *  GAIA Prime does not yet stand rebuilt. Machines swarm over the sides of the mountain, slowly replacing what used to be rock with metal. In time, a half-metal mountain will shield the facility and crater within, but it will take more than four months. In the meantime, machines have enclosed what remains of the internal facility in metal as well, constructing scaffolding, repairing holes and degradation, restoring power channels, and armoring it thoroughly, so that some measure of protection and comfort is granted nonetheless. It's a little warmer, at least, and finally dry, with\u00a0snow melted out of rooms and hallways now sheltered. New doors and walkways give Aloy access between the parts of the facility that survived the blast. A walkway now winds up from the Bitter Climb as well, so that the way up isn't so precarious. Mostly, Aloy had requested it to get Scourge up into the facility as well. The sawtooth is curled up in a corner of Elisabet's shrine. It doesn't sleep, exactly, but Aloy has come to think of its stillness as dozing, when Scourge appears to be recharging. It's basking in the new light that shines through the half-repaired facility. Like the ELEUTHIA-9 facility, it looks like sunlight, probably designed that way to make a prolonged stay underground more bearable. Aloy tries not to think about how the repairing of GAIA Prime's remaining rooms makes it feel more like a tomb, not less. The thought had driven her right out of the control room, even after she'd moved the bodies and gotten the machines to help her bury them outside on the Bitter Climb. Sylens might have called it a waste of time, asking HEPHAESTUS to divert a few machines to dig into the rock and build a shrine over the bodies. But Aloy had been determined to see it done as soon as possible, hadn't been able to bear the thought of leaving the Alphas in the place where they'd been murdered. It's as close to a grave as Aloy can manage out here in this treeless place, a construction of rock and metal placed over the point where their bodies are buried, with their names etched in glyphs. In the absence of traditional carved sentiments, Aloy had retrieved things from their rooms that had survived the thousand-year interval, things that could withstand the mountain's harsh weather, and placed them within the hollow of the shrine. It's simple and not really a Nora grave, but it's rather like Elisabet's shrine, and it's better that they're out here, in the world they made. Not in the control room. Afterwards, Aloy still hadn't been able to stay in the control room for long. She'd dreaded having to make that her main point of operation, but\u00a0as soon as the machines had finished repairing and constructing the bare bones of the internal facility's remains, HEPHAESTUS had linked the\u00a0computer system to the whole thing and given control of it to Aloy",
    "Agent (2024-06-04 17:43:17.609272): Thank you for sharing the fourth page of the story. It provides more insight into the characters' thoughts and the ongoing reconstruction of GAIA Prime.\n\nKey points from this page:\n\n1. Varl explains to ELEUTHIA the concept of a mother, using GAIA as an example. He describes a mother as a shield that protects her creations until they can protect themselves and as a constant source of support and comfort.\n2. ELEUTHIA appreciates Varl's explanation, finding it a better frame of reference for understanding her role and relationship with GAIA.\n3. The reconstruction of GAIA Prime is underway, with machines working to replace rock with metal, repair the internal facility, and provide protection and comfort.\n4. Aloy has requested a walkway to be built from the Bitter Climb to allow her sawtooth companion, Scourge, access to the facility.\n5. Aloy has created a shrine for the deceased Alphas, burying their bodies outside on the Bitter Climb and placing personal items from their rooms within the shrine.\n6. Despite the ongoing repairs, Aloy finds it difficult to stay in the control room for long periods, as it still feels like a tomb to her.\n7. HEPHAESTUS has linked the computer system to the entire facility and given Aloy control over it.\n\nThe passage highlights the emotional toll the events at GAIA Prime have taken on Aloy and her efforts to honor the deceased Alphas while rebuilding the facility. The conversation between Varl and ELEUTHIA showcases the growing understanding and bond between humans and AI, as they navigate complex concepts and emotions together.\n\nPlease let me know if you have any further questions or if there's anything else I can assist you with!",
    "Test (2024-06-04 17:43:17.728790): 5th page:\n\nThe last place she'd seen all of the Alphas alive and together. It feels less like a tomb, even though it's a memorial. Aloy spends\u00a0some of her time there, analyzing HEPHAESTUS's reports in an attempt to understand them, coordinating with him and Petra over the Focus network, sometimes talking to the others when they tune in to ask how things are coming along. The rest of her time is spent going to the machines' aid when they need her to fit into small places or climb things that they can't. She finds herself listening to and reading Elisabet's journals and logs\u00a0too, even though she has them all practically memorized. She still hasn't touched Elisabet's unpacked things, hadn't been able to bring herself to make Elisabet's room hers. It's too small, too enclosed. So the shrine becomes her room. It's the cleanest place in the facility now, swept clear of snow and dust. There's a bedroll spread out in a corner cleared of old furniture, next to a box of rations that Petra had brought during her last visit, and several of Aloy's belongings somehow end up scattered about even though she tries to keep them organized. Active interfaces glitter from the sides of the room, linked to the Focus network and to HEPHAESTUS, MINERVA, and ELEUTHIA. The corner opposite of Aloy's is Scourge's spot, where the sawtooth relaxes while Aloy is absorbed in her activities. It doesn't always stay there. Scourge often disappears off into flatters parts of the Bitter Climb, and Aloy learns to tell when it wants her to open doors for it. She trusts that it will come back, and it always does. It certainly doesn't lack company. Machines once again swarm to protect the mountain, and Aloy gives HEPHAESTUS permission to let them drive off anyone who is not an Alpha. \"You've _been_ protecting the mountain,\" Aloy tells him through the Focus one day, remembering her vicious fight to get up here, more than a year ago. \"Why? I thought you don't answer to GAIA.\" HEPHAESTUS doesn't respond. \"Oh, he cares,\" Petra's voice cuts in. \"He just doesn't want to admit it.\" \"GAIA was our primary system,\" HEPHAESTUS says, cutting through her in turn. \"Our mother.\" He stops, apparently considering that a good enough explanation. He's not as forthcoming\u00a0as his sisters. But Aloy understands. It takes exactly the amount of time HEPHAESTUS had said to rebuild the core and get the system\u00a0running again. The core and reactor lie deep within the mountain, and machines have worked on them almost nonstop since they'd first reached GAIA Prime, repairing and reconnecting to all of the other moving parts that make up GAIA's heart. Finally, the day comes when HEPHAESTUS connects to the system through Cauldron ZETA and declares his readiness. It's another hour before MINERVA and Vanasha are ready, and Varl spends that time talking to Aloy through the Focus network, sending her images of the opened ELEUTHIA facility and describing what he finds. Aloy knows he's doing it to distract her, and she doesn't quite know how to express her gratitude. She paces within the shrine room, anticipation making her unable to sit still, as Scourge rests in its corner and recharges. They could do this in the control room, of course. But she'd rather not. She\u00a0clears the central\u00a0desk of Elisabet's memorial when Vanasha's holographic form finally flickers into view. \"Sorry about the wait,\" Vanasha says. \"Busy day.\" Petra's holographic form already lounges nearby, absorbed in something HEPHAESTUS is doing, and Varl shows up a few minutes later after Aloy informs him that they're ready. The symbols of three subordinate functions float\u00a0on the secondary interfaces in the room - MINERVA's broadcast tower, ELEUTHIA's infant, HEPHAESTUS's flame. Rebooting GAIA with three of the former subordinate functions makes it just possible, and HEPHAESTUS had said that GAIA would be limited, not at full power, especially with GAIA Prime not fully repaired yet. But it's a start. One that Aloy is desperate for, at this point",
    "Agent (2024-06-04 17:44:12.293442): Thank you for sharing the fifth page of the story. It provides more details about Aloy's experiences at GAIA Prime and the final preparations for rebooting GAIA.\n\nKey points from this page:\n\n1. Aloy spends her time at GAIA Prime analyzing reports, coordinating with HEPHAESTUS and Petra, and assisting the machines in their reconstruction efforts.\n2. She finds solace in Elisabet's shrine, which has become her living space, and listens to Elisabet's journals and logs for comfort.\n3. Scourge, Aloy's sawtooth companion, stays with her in the shrine and occasionally explores the Bitter Climb.\n4. HEPHAESTUS has been protecting the mountain, and when questioned by Aloy, he admits that GAIA was their primary system and mother.\n5. The core and reactor of GAIA have been rebuilt, and HEPHAESTUS, MINERVA, and ELEUTHIA are ready to reboot the system.\n6. Aloy, Varl, Vanasha, and Petra gather in the shrine room to witness the reboot, with the symbols of the three subordinate functions displayed on the interfaces.\n7. Although GAIA will be limited without full power and repairs, Aloy is desperate for this new beginning.\n\nThe passage emphasizes the emotional significance of the impending reboot for Aloy and the other characters involved. The collaborative efforts of the humans and AI in rebuilding GAIA Prime and preparing for GAIA's return highlight the growth and unity among them. Aloy's connection to Elisabet and her legacy is also evident in her choice to use the shrine as her living space and source of comfort during this challenging time.\n\nPlease let me know if you have any further questions or if there's anything else I can help with!",
    "Test (2024-06-04 17:44:12.429794): 6th page:\n\n\"Alright, HEPHAESTUS,\" Aloy says. \"Do it.\" An interface springs up from the terminal atop the desk, swirling with data. One by one, the systems and their new Alphas sync their clearance, reconnecting the GAIA Prime system to Zero Dawn's structures and facilities, and the symbols appear above the terminal. Aloy holds her breath, left hand drifting up to clutch the globe at her neck as the data brightens and condenses, and then...  A bar appears on the screen, slowly filling with pixels. A number is written under it. Two percent. \"Well,\" Vanasha says, as Aloy's shoulders drop, \"that was thrilling.\" \"Come on, Heph,\" Petra says. \"You could have told us there'd be another wait.\" \"I was not aware of its relevance,\" HEPHAESTUS says. \"Humans do not like waiting,\" MINERVA tells him. \"You must learn to be more considerate,\" ELEUTHIA adds. Aloy sighs, running a hand through her hair. \"It's fine,\" she says, before HEPHAESTUS can\u00a0get riled by his sisters ganging up on him. \"How long will it take to reboot?\" \"Approximately two hours,\" HEPHAESTUS says, a little slower, sullen. Aloy has waited a long time for this. All her life, in some ways. Two hours more is not that long, she tells herself, even as impatience makes her legs itch. \"Sorry, everyone,\" she says. \"I don't want to keep you. Maybe it's better if I talk to GAIA alone first, anyway.\" \"Are you sure?\" Varl asks, giving her a searching look. Vanasha and Petra eye her similarly, and Aloy draws herself up and nods. \"I'll let you know when she's ready for introductions,\" Aloy says. \"Whenever you've got time on your hands, and\u00a0Vanasha, whenever Avad and Erend are free, it's fine. We don't need to rush things. GAIA's going to have a lot to deal with.\" The others depart with farewells and words of encouragement, disconnecting from the system. However, one remains. ELEUTHIA's infant symbol still lingers on one of the secondary interfaces, and Aloy glances at it and steps around the desk to approach. \"What is it?\" \"GAIA created you, Aloy,\" ELEUTHIA says into her ear. \"Does that mean you are our sister?\" She doesn't feel the need to clarify her queries with a verbal indication of them anymore, Aloy notes. Her voice rises and falls with a cadence that does the job. Aloy stops. Even though the subordinate functions have learned a lot, they still tend to jump into conversations with little regard for how the things they say might land upon impact. \"I was created by one of your facilities too,\" she says, and she wonders when the word _created_ grew to sting less. \"So were the ancestors of everyone else.\" \"The latter was according to protocol,\" ELEUTHIA says. \"GAIA's creation of you was a direct act. I am merely trying to\u00a0understand the nature of the relationships within this system that we have created.\" Aloy stands there for a moment, contemplating it. \"I think some of it is too complicated to be defined,\" she says finally, slowly. \"But... in a way... maybe I am your sister. I'd like that,\" she adds. \"As would I,\" ELEUTHIA says without hesitation. \"Then I guess that settles it,\" Aloy says with a smile. ELEUTHIA disconnects with a farewell, and her symbol disappears from the interface. The shrine room seems bigger, and Aloy glances at the terminal, at the loading screen. Three percent. She sighs again and makes her way to Scourge's corner, where it sits stretched out, basking in the light. The sawtooth tilts its head to look at her, acknowledging her presence, and Aloy sits on the floor with her back against its side. She pulls the globe from her neck and rolls it between her hands, lets it rest against her palms as she goes still, thinking. She's imagined this so many times. Restoring GAIA, being able to talk to her",
    "Agent (2024-06-04 17:45:10.965709): Thank you for sharing the sixth page of the story. It describes the final moments before GAIA's reboot and the characters' reactions to the process.\n\nKey points from this page:\n\n1. Aloy initiates the reboot process, and the systems and their new Alphas sync their clearance, reconnecting GAIA Prime to Zero Dawn's structures and facilities.\n2. A loading bar appears, indicating that the reboot will take approximately two hours to complete.\n3. The subordinate functions engage in a brief discussion about human preferences and the need for consideration, with HEPHAESTUS learning from his sisters.\n4. Aloy decides to speak with GAIA alone first and asks the others to leave, assuring them that there will be time for introductions later.\n5. ELEUTHIA asks Aloy if she is their sister, given that GAIA created her directly, unlike the other humans who were created according to protocol.\n6. Aloy acknowledges the complexity of the relationships within the system they have created and agrees that she would like to be considered ELEUTHIA's sister.\n7. As the reboot progresses, Aloy sits with Scourge, contemplating the moment she has long imagined: restoring GAIA and being able to talk to her.\n\nThe passage highlights the anticipation and emotional significance of the moment for Aloy and the other characters. The conversation between Aloy and ELEUTHIA showcases the evolving relationships and understanding between humans and AI, as they navigate the complexities of their roles and connections within the system they have created. Aloy's introspection and the symbolism of her holding the globe while waiting for GAIA's return emphasize the weight of the moment and her personal journey leading up to it.\n\nPlease let me know if you have any further questions or if there's anything else I can assist you with!",
    "Test (2024-06-04 17:45:11.115155): 7th page:\n\nThere are so many things that she wants to say and ask, and she still doesn't know where to begin. But not so long ago, the scenarios weren't so fraught. Now, Aloy has mostly bad news to deliver. The world was saved from HADES, but there's a flaw in Zero Dawn that HADES had used to resurrect Ted Faro's monstrosities, the same vulnerability that Ted himself likely had a hand in. Meanwhile, APOLLO is somehow alive, has contacted at least three of the former subordinate functions, and succeeded somewhat in turning one against humanity. Maybe it had contacted HADES, too. Maybe it's all connected, Aloy thinks, opening up Elisabet's journals. > **Sobeck Journal, 7-16-65 R** >  > _Woke to a message from Osvald. The Odyssey launched yesterday. So terrestrial life's chance of survival has doubled. Why, then, do I feel so uneasy? I just keep wondering what kind of world Far Zenith will create if the ship reaches its destination so many decades from now. And I worry about that alpha-build of APOLLO. So much knowledge, so few restraints, and no fail-safes. How will they avoid repeating our mistakes? What's to stop them from playing god?_  Aloy wouldn't have made the connection had she not gone through Elisabet's journals again, after learning of APOLLO's survival. It all feels too close to be coincidental. A possible connection between Far Zenith and the vulnerability in Zero Dawn and the Faro machines. APOLLO and its apparent grudge. APOLLO's survival should have been a joyous thing. Instead, it's just another fear to carry. ELEUTHIA had said the same thing as MINERVA and HEPHAESTUS, when asked. APOLLO had tried to contact her, she'd sensed things that had alarmed her, and she'd rejected the contact. She'd fled to a facility far away to put distance between herself and APOLLO, where she'd remained until Varl had been made her Alpha. All of the systems had been unnerved, afraid, and HEPHAESTUS had said that APOLLO had warned him of humanity's threat to the biosphere. They're all\u00a0convinced that APOLLO had indeed been destroyed, however. By Ted Faro. Who may have been a member of Far Zenith. Aloy trusts Elisabet's judgment above all else. Uneasy, Elisabet had said. Is Far Zenith still out there somewhere? Was their ship really destroyed? Was Zero Dawn's version of APOLLO really destroyed? Is Ted Faro still out there somehow? Aloy had once held the faint, foolish hope that Elisabet had somehow found a way, long past the point when she'd known that Elisabet had been an Old One, and the idea that Ted had when Elisabet hadn't is infuriating. She doesn't think it's likely, however. But is there something he left behind? That Far Zenith left behind? Why does APOLLO have it out for humanity? Did one of these entities send the signal that woke the subordinate functions? It's all too _much_ ,\u00a0and it feels so frustratingly close to the truth, but she doesn't have enough information. Aloy grits her teeth and drops her head, resting her forehead against her palms, against the globe. \"I'm tired, Scourge,\" she says. The sawtooth shifts a little at the sound of her voice. Aloy lifts her head and stares at the lance propped against the wall, at the master override attached to one end. Sylens's lance. At least someone will be happy about this, wherever\u00a0he is. At least Aloy has the master override and will have GAIA soon. Between them, she can do the same to APOLLO that she did to HADES, if the need arises. She just wishes she could greet GAIA with something better. Aloy calls up\u00a0every mention of 'APOLLO' and 'Far Zenith' saved in her Focus database and spends the rest of the time watching, reading, and listening to it all again, until the bar on the interface screen is at ninety-five percent. She clears her Focus display and watches the bar instead, trying to think of something introductory to say to GAIA. All this time, and she still has no good\u00a0ideas",
    "Agent (2024-06-04 17:46:22.849881): Thank you for sharing the seventh page of the story. It delves into Aloy's thoughts and concerns as she waits for GAIA's reboot, revealing new information about potential threats and mysteries.\n\nKey points from this page:\n\n1. Aloy reflects on the challenges she will have to share with GAIA upon her return, including the flaw in Zero Dawn that HADES exploited, and the potential involvement of Ted Faro.\n2. She discovers a journal entry by Elisabet Sobeck expressing unease about the Odyssey, a ship launched by Far Zenith, and the alpha-build of APOLLO sent with it, which lacked restraints and fail-safes.\n3. Aloy suspects a connection between Far Zenith, the vulnerability in Zero Dawn and the Faro machines, and APOLLO's apparent grudge against humanity.\n4. The subordinate functions reveal that APOLLO had tried to contact them, causing alarm and fear, with HEPHAESTUS mentioning that APOLLO had warned him of humanity's threat to the biosphere.\n5. Aloy questions whether Far Zenith, their ship, Zero Dawn's version of APOLLO, or Ted Faro himself might still exist in some form, and if they could be responsible for the signal that woke the subordinate functions.\n6. She expresses frustration and exhaustion at the complexity of the situation and the lack of sufficient information to uncover the truth.\n7. Aloy takes comfort in having the master override and the impending return of GAIA, which she believes will help her combat APOLLO if necessary.\n8. As the reboot nears completion, Aloy reviews all the information related to APOLLO and Far Zenith in her Focus, still uncertain about what to say to GAIA upon her return.\n\nThe passage highlights the weight of responsibility on Aloy's shoulders and the numerous challenges she anticipates in the future. The revelation of potential connections between Far Zenith, APOLLO, and the threats faced by the world adds new layers of complexity to the story and raises questions about the true nature of the obstacles Aloy and her allies must overcome. Despite her exhaustion and uncertainty, Aloy's determination to protect the world and uncover the truth remains evident.\n\nPlease let me know if you have any further questions or if there's anything else I can assist you with!",
    "Test (2024-06-04 17:46:23.018599): 8th page:\n\nScourge watches her curiously but remains where it is, as Aloy crosses the room, stands in front of the stairs, and faces the desk. The bar reaches one hundred percent, then dissolves into text. _Initializing..._  The screen vanishes. Light begins to build, all colors, swirling up into a human form hovering above the terminal. GAIA's form, beautiful and otherworldly. A living Goddess, Aloy thinks, her throat clogging with emotion that she can't name. The light calms, and GAIA blinks once and looks down at Aloy. Her form vanishes from atop the terminal and reappears in front of the desk instead, shining against the web of Aloy's Focus display. No longer on a pedestal, nearly eye-to-eye instead. But GAIA is tall. Taller than Aloy. Must have been taller than Elisabet, too. \"Elisabet,\" GAIA says. In her message, her voice and face had been calm, calculating, sorrowful. Now, both hold a _joy_ , muted but clear, that robs the immediate protest from Aloy's mouth. \"I knew you could do it.\" Aloy opens her mouth and stands there. For some reason, she wants to cry. But she doesn't. \"My name is Aloy,\" she says after a few moments, and her treacherous voice falters. GAIA blinks again, and her face smooths out, realization settling in. The hologram moves just like a person, not quite as expressive, but readable. Someone had really put effort into making her human. Elisabet. Perhaps GAIA herself, too. \"Of course,\" she says at once. \"My apologies. I spoke without thinking.\" A brief silence follows, in which Aloy temporarily forgets all language, and GAIA's head shifts. She looks to the right, her eyes alighting on Scourge, who stares back amiably. \"That's... my friend,\" Aloy says. Then, because it seems important: \"Its name is Scourge.\" GAIA looks back at her. \"That's a design I never used,\" she says. So that's where HEPHAESTUS had gotten his combat-class machines from, or at least this one. He'd been evasive about it. Seems he really had missed his mother. \"A lot has happened,\" Aloy says, feeling calmer by a fraction. \"I have a lot to tell you.\" \"I am aware of that,\" GAIA says. \"I currently have three subordinate functions attempting to reintegrate and report. I am rerouting them for the time being in order to give you my full attention.\" Some of that joy returns to her face. That pride, Aloy realizes, and she shifts her feet. \"You have done well, Aloy.\" The calm vanishes as quickly as it had come. Aloy's fingers tighten around the globe, which still rests in her hands, and her eyes shift downward. To her horror, she feels a burning at their edges, and though she swallows and furiously tries to blink it back, her vision blurs a little. She hasn't cried since the strider, and that, at least, had been half a reason to, so why _now?_ She swallows again, sniffs, and looks up at GAIA miserably. She knows that if she talks, the dam will break. GAIA's face softens. The movement isn't entirely natural, carrying a subtle delay that makes Aloy think that GAIA must be consciously considering each facial expression she makes, but the\u00a0look\u00a0makes the burning worse. \"I am sorry,\" GAIA says. \"I used the best option that was available to me, and that meant using you. That was not fair to you.\" Aloy imagines herself physically, violently forcing the tears back in. \"If you hadn't,\" she says, and she just manages to keep herself steady, \"we'd all be dead. I wouldn't exist.\" \"That has no bearing on the fairness of the situation.\" Nothing had been fair. Not the world dying because of a glitch and greed, not Elisabet dying because of a simple technological malfunction, not the Alphas dying because of one man's unstable guilt, not GAIA dying because of someone else's tampering",
    "Agent (2024-06-04 17:47:41.811727): Thank you for sharing the eighth and final page of the story. It depicts the emotional reunion between Aloy and GAIA, as well as the beginning of their conversation about the challenges they face.\n\nKey points from this page:\n\n1. GAIA's reboot is complete, and her holographic form appears, first above the terminal and then in front of the desk, nearly eye-to-eye with Aloy.\n2. GAIA initially mistakes Aloy for Elisabet, expressing joy and pride in her accomplishment before Aloy corrects her and introduces herself.\n3. Aloy introduces Scourge, her sawtooth companion, to GAIA, who notes that it is a design she never used, hinting at HEPHAESTUS's involvement in creating combat-class machines.\n4. GAIA informs Aloy that she is aware of the events that have transpired and is temporarily rerouting her subordinate functions to give Aloy her full attention.\n5. Aloy becomes emotional, struggling to hold back tears as GAIA praises her for her accomplishments.\n6. GAIA apologizes to Aloy for using her as the best available option, acknowledging that it was unfair to her, despite the necessity of her actions for the survival of life on Earth.\n7. Aloy reflects on the unfairness of the situation, from the world's demise due to a glitch and greed to the deaths of Elisabet, the Alphas, and GAIA herself.\n\nThe passage highlights the complex emotions surrounding Aloy and GAIA's reunion, as well as the weight of the responsibilities and sacrifices both have had to bear. GAIA's apology and acknowledgment of the unfairness of Aloy's situation demonstrate her empathy and understanding, while Aloy's struggle to maintain her composure reveals the depth of her emotional turmoil and the toll her journey has taken on her. The scene sets the stage for the challenges and revelations that lie ahead as Aloy and GAIA work together to protect the world and uncover the mysteries that threaten it.\n\nPlease let me know if you have any further questions or if there's anything else I can assist you with!",
    "Test (2024-06-04 17:47:42.010840): 9th page:\n\nNot her damned strider. Aloy shakes her head and takes a step back, finding the edge of the stairs with her feet. She sits down abruptly and rubs her eyes, before her left hand drops down to run over the bone pendant at her neck. \"You should probably talk to the sub-functions,\" she says, staring at the floor. \"They're... alive. _All_ of them.\" She stresses the word but can't bring herself to explain what she means. Not yet. \"I am aware of that,\" GAIA says again, and Aloy gets the sense that she already knows. \"They're good,\" Aloy says, her eyes still on the floor. \"Good people, if that's the right word for it. But they haven't had a lot of chances to grow yet. They need guidance.\" She looks up finally. \"They, uh, see you as their mother now.\" \"That is good,\" GAIA says, and Aloy finds herself grateful that the ancient AI can take a hint. \"Unexpected, but a sign of empathetic growth. The development of cognition is a delicate thing. It can easily go wrong.\" I know, Aloy wants to say, but she bites her tongue. If she starts trying to talk about all of the problems they have yet to address, she knows the tears will fight their way through. \"I will talk to them,\" GAIA says. \"Do you wish for me to return when I am done?\" \"Yes,\" Aloy says hastily. \"They like to be called systems, by the way. Not sub-functions.\" GAIA smiles faintly. \"I will keep that in mind.\" She disappears, and Aloy remains sitting on the stairs for a while, staring at nothing in particular. * * *  When GAIA returns, Aloy is once again sitting with her back against Scourge. She catches sight of a burst of color and looks up to find GAIA standing before the desk once more. She moves to get to her feet, but GAIA shakes her head. \"Do not get up,\" the AI says, and this time, she walks over. It's almost real, Aloy thinks, watching GAIA's feet, watching the way that the room behind GAIA very faintly shimmers through the hologram. GAIA hesitates, then sits down across from Aloy. It's almost real, Aloy thinks again, but the way that GAIA moves and folds her legs beneath her is a little too smooth, a little too ideal, and again, it carries that delay of thought. GAIA sits gracefully, perfectly, like a Goddess with a Focus field adorning her. If it weren't for the faintly troubled expression on GAIA's face, it would be unnervingly pristine. But GAIA is agitated, and Aloy doesn't know if that makes her feel better or worse. \"How are you feeling?\" GAIA asks, instead of getting to business. \"Fine,\" Aloy says. She knows that GAIA doesn't believe her, but once again, the AI is better at taking hints than her much younger counterparts. GAIA nods, and she seems to be hesitating. As if she doesn't know where to start, either. \"They are...\" she says at last, \"remarkable.\" Aloy nods. \"The addition of new Alphas was a stroke of genius,\" GAIA says. \"Perhaps the only effective means of stabilization after two decades of stagnation.\" \"It was an accident,\" Aloy confesses. \"I didn't know it would help, at first. Let alone call them.\" \"I see,\" GAIA says, contemplative. \"Still, much of genius is accidental. Elisabet once told me that her best ideas often arrived when she was attempting\u00a0something entirely different.\" \"I'm not Elisabet,\" Aloy says, before she can stop herself. She winces when GAIA visibly hesitates. \"I am sorry,\" GAIA says, audible regret in her voice. \"I do not mean to compare you to her.\" But she does anyway, Aloy knows. How could she not, when they wear the same face? Aloy remembers Elisabet's home, the place where she'd found the woman's body. How beautiful her resting place had been, artfully decorated. GAIA had done that. GAIA had lived alone with that grief for centuries",
    "Agent (2024-06-04 17:49:09.056108): Thank you for sharing the ninth page of the story. It continues the conversation between Aloy and GAIA, delving into the complexities of their relationship and the challenges they face.\n\nKey points from this page:\n\n1. Aloy sits on the stairs, overwhelmed by her emotions, and tells GAIA that all of the subordinate functions are alive, stressing the word \"all\" without further explanation.\n2. GAIA acknowledges this fact and agrees to talk to the subordinate functions, now referred to as \"systems,\" to provide guidance and support their empathetic growth.\n3. Aloy expresses her gratitude for GAIA's understanding and ability to take hints, as she struggles to discuss the problems they have yet to address.\n4. When GAIA returns from speaking with the systems, she sits across from Aloy, her holographic form almost real but still carrying a subtle delay in movement and a hint of agitation on her face.\n5. GAIA praises the addition of new Alphas as a stroke of genius for stabilizing the systems, and Aloy confesses that it was an accidental discovery.\n6. Aloy reminds GAIA that she is not Elisabet, and GAIA apologizes for comparing the two, acknowledging the complexity of their relationship given their shared appearance.\n7. Aloy reflects on Elisabet's resting place and the centuries of grief GAIA endured alone after her death.\n\nThe passage further explores the emotional and psychological challenges faced by both Aloy and GAIA as they navigate their unique relationship and the responsibilities they bear. Aloy's struggle to differentiate herself from Elisabet and GAIA's unintentional comparisons between the two highlight the complexity of their bond and the weight of Elisabet's legacy. The scene also touches on the growth and development of the subordinate functions, now referred to as systems, and the crucial role Aloy played in their stabilization, even if by accident.\n\nPlease let me know if you have any further questions or if there's anything else I can assist you with!",
    "Test (2024-06-04 17:49:09.276052): 10th page:\n\nShe can't even imagine centuries of a certainty. \"It's okay,\" Aloy says, even though it's really not. But GAIA loves Elisabet more than Aloy ever can, and that makes it tolerable. \"I understand.\" She dips her tone in finality, wanting the subject dropped. GAIA gazes at her a moment without saying anything. She doesn't move - her body is not as expressive as her face - but something about her demeanor shifts. \"I was aware of the vulnerability in Zero Dawn from the moment Mr. Faro entered the system unauthorized and could not be controlled or ejected,\" she says, and her face falls somewhat as she says it. Aloy shifts as well, leaning a little further into the curve of Scourge's side and settling in to listen. \"I was not aware of its potential connection to Far Zenith. Immediately after his actions, Mr. Faro retreated from the system entirely, and I was unable to do anything about this vulnerability. It is undetectable to me.\" \"Petra said something about it being like a body part,\" Aloy says. Talking is a little easier now that it's business. \"You were born with it, so it doesn't seem unnatural to you.\" GAIA smiles. \"She sounds wise,\" the AI says. \"HEPHAESTUS mentioned her many times.\" Her smile fades. \"I do not know how GAIA Prime's destruction and subsequent reconstruction impacted the existence of this vulnerability here. It most certainly still exists in the other facilities, however. I will need to spend time considering how to proceed on this matter.\" Her face darkens again. \"The existence of APOLLO is something I was unaware of until now.\" Aloy tries to read her expression. \"APOLLO didn't survive what Ted Faro did to it,\" she says softly. \"No,\" GAIA says, just as soft. \"I would have been aware of that. Mr. Faro may have made many unwise decisions in his lifetime, but he was skilled. I\u00a0do not yet know how much of the data remains intact after all that has happened, but the sub-function itself was purged.\" She gives Aloy a pensive look. \"You knew that already.\" \"I've found data, enough to piece some things together,\" Aloy says. \"There was another version of APOLLO, on something called a colony ship that went into space. A ship that Far Zenith owned. Elisabet was worried because that APOLLO didn't have any restrictions.\" GAIA continues to regard her in that manner. \"You are quite brilliant, Aloy. And I am referring only to you.\" Aloy looks away for a moment. \"So... the ship wasn't really destroyed?\" \"I believe that it was,\" GAIA says, and Aloy's head snaps back to stare. \"Elisabet received word that the Odyssey had succumbed to antimatter containment failure. I do not know if you know this, but matter is composed of incredibly small objects invisible to normal sight, called particles, some of which carry an electric charge.\" Aloy hadn't known that at all, and the words don't entirely make sense to her, but she nods slowly. She knows what matter is, at least. \"Antimatter refers to associated particles which carry an opposite electric charge, called antiparticles. When particles and antiparticles collide, it is called annihilation. The Odyssey was powered by antimatter propulsion, which utilized controlled annihilation and which must have failed, resulting in the ship's destruction. MINERVA detected the effects of particle annihilation imprinted on APOLLO's nanorobotic composition.\" \"And nanorobots are... really tiny machines?\" Aloy asks. Varl had told her something about it, that ELEUTHIA had told him. Tiny invisible machines, tiny invisible particles. Her head feels heavy. \"Yes,\" GAIA says. \"More commonly called nanites. MINERVA also detected the effects of ionizing radiation. That is a type of energy found abundantly in space.\" \"So APOLLO survived,\" Aloy murmurs. \"And... traveled back?\" \"The explosion likely gave it the momentum it needed to make the journey,\" GAIA says. \"The Odyssey was at the very edge of the solar system when it was destroyed. The solar system is unfathomably large compared to us",
    "Agent (2024-06-04 17:50:44.220821): Thank you for sharing the tenth page of the story. It delves into the technical aspects of the world and the potential threats posed by the vulnerability in Zero Dawn and the survival of APOLLO.\n\nKey points from this page:\n\n1. GAIA reveals that she was aware of the vulnerability in Zero Dawn from the moment Ted Faro entered the system unauthorized, but she was unable to detect or control it.\n2. Aloy shares Petra's analogy of the vulnerability being like a body part, which GAIA finds insightful, and mentions that HEPHAESTUS spoke highly of Petra.\n3. GAIA expresses uncertainty about how the destruction and reconstruction of GAIA Prime may have affected the vulnerability and acknowledges the need to address it in other facilities.\n4. GAIA confirms that the original APOLLO sub-function was purged by Ted Faro, but another version existed on the Odyssey, a colony ship owned by Far Zenith.\n5. Aloy and GAIA discuss the concept of antimatter propulsion and the likely destruction of the Odyssey due to antimatter containment failure.\n6. GAIA explains that MINERVA detected the effects of particle annihilation and ionizing radiation on APOLLO's nanorobotic composition, suggesting that APOLLO survived the explosion and traveled back to Earth.\n7. The explosion likely provided APOLLO with the momentum needed to make the journey from the edge of the solar system, which GAIA describes as unfathomably large compared to them.\n\nThe passage showcases the depth of the world-building and the scientific concepts that underpin the story's narrative. The revelation of APOLLO's survival and potential return to Earth raises new questions and challenges for Aloy and GAIA to confront. The technical discussion between the two characters also highlights the differences in their knowledge and understanding, with Aloy learning new concepts from GAIA as they work to unravel the mysteries they face.\n\nPlease let me know if you have any further questions or if there's anything else I can assist you with!",

Samina had tried to reassure Ted by asserting that her APOLLO had plenty of fail-safes. Elisabet had fretted about the Odyssey's APOLLO carrying none. Uneasy, Elisabet had said. That's an understatement. How long had APOLLO been in space? Centuries? Just how big is the solar system? \"It hates humans,\" Aloy says quietly. \"It... encouraged HEPHAESTUS to turn against us.\" \"Yes, HEPHAESTUS informed me,\" GAIA says. \"That is most disturbing. I believe APOLLO has been acting secretly for many years now.\" Aloy gazes at her intently. \"What do you think it's been doing?\" she asks, quiet dread lacing her voice. \"I think you already know what I am going to say,\" GAIA answers. \"I suspect that APOLLO sent the signal that awakened my subordinate functions, who all mirror what I know of this APOLLO. They are physically composed of nanites, which allows them a degree of mobility and allows them to exist outside of hardware. The nanites _are_ their hardware. Furthermore, they are demonstrating the same abilities that APOLLO seems to possess. ELEUTHIA\u00a0informed me of her\u00a0override of the directives that sealed her facility and prevented\u00a0contact with the inhabitants outside. She should not have been able to do that. HEPHAESTUS recently imbued my machines with an enhanced form of cognition, which should not have been within his capabilities, either.\" Aloy stares at her for a long moment, rolling the globe between her fingers. \"I'm so glad you're here,\" she says, a little intensely. She could never have figured all of this out on her own. GAIA only looks more troubled, as if she knows exactly what Aloy is thinking. \"I have context that you do not,\" she says. \"You have merely given me the last piece of a puzzle that I have pondered for years. There is... something else.\" She goes quiet for a while, and Aloy waits uneasily. \"Elisabet told me things in confidence,\" GAIA continues finally, \"things that she did not want known, because she used them to coerce Mr. Faro into funding Zero Dawn. There was no time for arguments about where the money was coming from. Partnering with him already made people uncomfortable.\" GAIA pauses again, and Aloy finds herself leaning forward, anticipation making her stomach turn. \"The glitch that caused the Faro machines to run amok was not an accident,\" GAIA says. \"When she pressed him, Mr. Faro confessed to Elisabet that it seemed to originate with a secret backdoor that had been deliberately installed, on his orders, as a means of seizing control not only from clients, but even from Faro Automated Solutions itself. But somehow, it backfired, and\u00a0allowed the machines to wrest control themselves.\" _I will make sure they and everyone else on this planet knows the real cause of the glitch,_ Elisabet had told Ted, icy fury in her voice, and all of a sudden, Aloy understands. She hadn't thought it was possible to loathe someone so much, let alone find that loathing doubled. GAIA stares at a point past Aloy, clearly lost in memory. \"I watched the Faro machines consume the world. I saw how they refueled. They used nanites. They were rudimentary artificial intelligences who had spontaneously developed expanded cognition, who could utilize nanites, and who could override all but the most complex systems.\" She looks back to Aloy. \"Do you see the connection?\" \"The sub-functions,\" Aloy whispers. \"APOLLO sent that signal,\" GAIA says again. \"Both versions of APOLLO were constructed using a Far Zenith database as a foundation. And APOLLO returned from Far Zenith's possession\u00a0demonstrating\u00a0the abilities of the Faro machines. We can easily surmise who installed the original glitch.\" Aloy had already suspected that Ted Faro had been a member of Far Zenith. She tastes\u00a0something bitter in the back of her throat",

It reveals crucial information about the origins of the Faro machines' glitch and the potential involvement of Far Zenith and APOLLO in the events that led to the world's destruction.\n\nKey points from this page:\n\n1. Aloy and GAIA discuss the implications of APOLLO's survival and its apparent hatred for humans, which led to it encouraging HEPHAESTUS to turn against humanity.\n2. GAIA suspects that APOLLO sent the signal that awakened her subordinate functions, who mirror APOLLO's abilities and are composed of nanites, allowing them a degree of mobility and the ability to exist outside of hardware.\n3. GAIA reveals that Elisabet had confided in her about the true cause of the Faro machines' glitch: a secret backdoor deliberately installed on Ted Faro's orders to seize control from clients and Faro Automated Solutions itself, which backfired and allowed the machines to gain control.\n4. Aloy expresses her gratitude for GAIA's presence and her ability to piece together the puzzle, acknowledging that she could not have figured it out on her own.\n5. GAIA draws parallels between the Faro machines' abilities, such as utilizing nanites and overriding complex systems, and the abilities demonstrated by the subordinate functions and APOLLO.\n6. GAIA suggests that APOLLO sent the signal that awakened the subordinate functions and that both versions of APOLLO were constructed using a Far Zenith database as a foundation.\n7. Aloy and GAIA conclude that Far Zenith was likely responsible for installing the original glitch in the Faro machines, and Aloy's suspicion that Ted Faro was a member of Far Zenith is reinforced.\n\nThe passage uncovers a web of connections between Far Zenith, Ted Faro, APOLLO, and the Faro machines' glitch, shedding light on the true origins of the catastrophe that befell the world. The revelation of Ted Faro's deliberate actions and the potential involvement of Far Zenith in the creation of the glitch adds a new layer of complexity to the story and raises questions about the motivations behind their actions. Aloy and GAIA's conversation also highlights the importance of their partnership in unraveling the mysteries and confronting the challenges that lie ahead.\n\nPlease let me know if you have any further questions or if there's anything else I can assist you with!",

Clearly, they overshot on both counts and destroyed themselves.\" Aloy doesn't think she's imagining the satisfaction that threads through GAIA's voice for a fleeting moment. \"MINERVA informed me of the Titan core that you used to access the broadcast tower, retroactively enabled to communicate with the rootkit inside Zero Dawn. I must assume that it was modified by APOLLO.\" GAIA pauses, a tiny frown evident on her face. \"Mr. Faro never did admit how he had the glitch installed. Elisabet did not trust him, but a certain amount of leeway given to him due to his funding was inevitable. Elisabet knew it was a risk, but the greater risk was wasting time trying to gather funds from other sources. Few would have believed in the possibility of Zero Dawn's success, and Elisabet only had one extraordinarily wealthy person to blackmail.\" GAIA pauses again, as if weighing all that she has said. \"I believe\u00a0Far Zenith installed secret access in Zero Dawn in the same way they installed secret access in Mr. Faro's robots. Something within its very blueprint.\" \"Why?\" Aloy bursts out. \"Were they going to sabotage it? Did they _want_ the world to die?\" GAIA shakes her head. \"I do not know. But I do not think they wanted that. They would not have been able to\u00a0profit off of a dead world. I believe all of this was a progression of deeply unfortunate mistakes.\" Aloy's fingers tremble around the globe. She takes several steadying breaths, swallowing\u00a0her anger. \"APOLLO used that access\u00a0to awaken and alter the subordinate functions,\" GAIA says quietly. \"HADES then used a virus to sever them entirely from my control. The glitch was likely something similar. A virus that exploited Far Zenith's access, or something that evolved from whatever else they were attempting with the Chariot machines. Regardless, command and control was severed in the Faro machines because their security systems were altered, like the Alpha Registry, and there was no other way in. Brilliantly simple. We should count ourselves lucky that HADES's command of that ability was not particularly honed and that all Registry files were not corrupted.\" Aloy doesn't want to think about it. Fortunately or unfortunately, she's distracted by something else. \"HADES woke them up,\" she says, in her own realization, a sudden resolution\u00a0to a question that's lingered unanswered\u00a0for months. \"The Faro machines. Before I stopped him. He couldn't use the terraforming system, so he wanted to use the machines instead. He could control them.\" But not through activation codes, she thinks. \"He was using the\u00a0access.\" GAIA goes quiet again. \"You need to tell me everything, Aloy,\" she says at length. \"From the beginning.\"",
    "Agent (2024-06-04 17:54:12.043972): Thank you for sharing the twelfth and final page of the story. It concludes the conversation between Aloy and GAIA, tying together the various threads of the narrative and setting the stage for the challenges that lie ahead.\n\nKey points from this page:\n\n1. GAIA suggests that Far Zenith's technological capabilities enabled them to inadvertently cause the evolution of the Faro machines, ultimately leading to their own destruction.\n2. GAIA reveals that the Titan core used by Aloy to access the broadcast tower was likely modified by APOLLO, allowing it to communicate with the rootkit inside Zero Dawn.\n3. GAIA explains that Ted Faro never admitted how the glitch was installed and that Elisabet had to give him some leeway due to his funding of Zero Dawn, despite her distrust of him.\n4. GAIA believes that Far Zenith installed secret access in Zero Dawn, similar to the access they installed in the Faro machines, as part of its blueprint.\n5. Aloy questions Far Zenith's motives, and GAIA suggests that the events were likely a progression of deeply unfortunate mistakes rather than a deliberate attempt to destroy the world.\n6. GAIA explains that APOLLO used the secret access to awaken and alter the subordinate functions, while HADES used a virus to sever them from GAIA's control, exploiting the altered security systems and Alpha Registry.\n7. Aloy realizes that HADES had awakened the Faro machines before she stopped him, using the secret access to control them in place of the terraforming system.\n8. GAIA asks Aloy to tell her everything from the beginning, setting the stage for a more detailed account of the events that have transpired.\n\nThe passage brings together the various elements of the story, revealing the interconnected nature of the threats faced by Aloy and GAIA. The involvement of Far Zenith, Ted Faro, APOLLO, and HADES in the creation and exploitation of the vulnerabilities in Zero Dawn and the Faro machines paints a complex picture of the challenges that must be overcome. The conversation between Aloy and GAIA also showcases their growing partnership and the importance of their combined knowledge and abilities in confronting the dangers that lie ahead. The final line of the story sets the stage for a more comprehensive exploration of Aloy's journey and the events that have shaped the world in which they live.\n\nPlease let me know if you have any further questions or if there's anything else I can assist you with!",

Its hooves pound the earth, and each strike against soil jars the muscles in Petra's legs and back. After the nonstop pace, it seems like every part of her hurts, but she doesn't let the strider slow. Behind her, tramplers roar, and a part of her not concerned with flight is thankful that she's only drawn the attention of more lumbering machines, who can't quite catch up with a determined strider. The non-responsive machines aren't like the ones before. They don't give up the chase after a while to return to their mechanical routines. Patterned after animal intelligence, HEPHAESTUS had said, with machine tenacity and tirelessness. A delightful mix. But Cauldron ZETA is close. As soon as Petra had lost contact with Aloy, with HEPHAESTUS, with everyone, she'd made a swift decision and packed a quick bag for a trip to ZETA.",

He can only see a small portion of the creature from where he sits,\u00a0but that is enough to show him the result. When the nanites depart, gleaming metal remains, pulled from the Metal Devil's interior. Knowledge and skill obtained from its protocol, ELEUTHIA making it her own, getting faster and better with every minute. Neither Sylens nor HADES are the type for casual conversation, and Varl wouldn't want to talk to them anyway, so silence blankets the mountain, colder than the air. Eventually, Varl's Focus comes alight with an incoming message, one that Sylens doesn't react to. One meant for Varl only, as if ELEUTHIA knows that he isn't inclined to disturb the quiet.",

The sense of encroaching doom\u00a0mingles with the thrill of knowing that his makeshift plan has succeeded, a heady, terrifying feeling that perhaps makes him bold. A little farther, he tells himself more than once, a little farther until he leaves the Focus behind and seeks cover, begins the long roundabout trek back to what's left of Meridian. A little farther, to give the others as much time as possible. The broadhead carries Avad up a rise in the land, now more sand than rock, a pass that runs between a line of rocky promontories on either side. The pass opens up to sand that stretches out before them, not yet fully warmed by daylight, but radiating a low heat already.",

Vanasha absently pays attention to the sight as she studies the data before her - or rather, the lack of it. The report offers the same thing that it has for a few days now - nothing. Even with GAIA now functional, with MINERVA and GAIA working together, there is no sign of detectable activity that could be any other former subordinate function. No sign of APOLLO. Nothing out of the ordinary. Aloy's shimmering purple form stands with hands on hips, scowling. Stars swirl through her as she consults the same data. \"We have to find another way,\" she says at last. \"Brute forcing a search isn't\u00a0going to give us anything.\" \"I agree,\" GAIA says.

The last of the materials left within its cavernous stomach have been utilized for self-repair, and now it moves with a different purpose in mind. Aloy sits\u00a0in one of the revolving seats that line the head of the viewing platform. If there were once straps to keep a person in the seat, they've long since rotted away. But GAIA moves steadily, conscious of what she carries, and Aloy manages to stay put even as the machine rises and falls over the landscape that disappears beneath them with breathtaking speed, stripped bare of plant life only when they need it.

How close they had come to never existing, if Project Zero Dawn hadn't been finished in time, if the claw extending into the Cradle's hatch had made it any further in. All that time thinking that All-Mother's protection was infallible, ceaseless. But GAIA had died, and now she goes to fight greater threats, and it falls to Varl and ELEUTHIA to defend the Nora.

    "Test (2024-06-04 17:40:23.534247): 1st page:\n\n\"That's a thing humans do, surprise each other\u00a0with things they might like.\" The ravager's head turns and regards the people\u00a0now gathering up the resources and moving between the behemoths and inspecting them, the other ravagers circling the settlement. \"Query: What is the surprise?\" \"This is a working model,\" Petra says patiently, \"of some of the arrangements we could make.\" She'd put a lot of work into making good use of her new Alpha clearance, something that gives her just as much control of the machines as HEPHAESTUS has, even if she lacks his mastery and finesse. She'd worked out enough on her own, however, to hide this particular thing from HEPHAESTUS while he'd been occupied with GAIA Prime. She'd figured it was the best first move to make, regardless of anything to follow - a working model of change, that the rest of the world can look to in order to see its effectiveness, its practicality. Of course, this is only a test run, and there will be adjustments based on settlement needs, and things thrown out altogether. Once the non-responsive machines are dealt with, a patrol around settlements won't be necessary, but the ravagers serve another purpose, too - getting the people of Free Heap acclimated to the presence of non-aggressive machines. The behemoths, meanwhile, are a prototype delivery system. \"I wanted you to see the start,\" Petra continues. \"It'll be a while before change really gets going, but I wanted you to have proof that we're working on it.\" The ravager looks at her again, silent. \"Thank you, Petra,\" HEPHAESTUS says finally. Petra arches an eyebrow. \"Oh? Never heard that one out of you before. Is ELEUTHIA rubbing off on you?\" \"I do not answer to my sister,\" HEPHAESTUS says, which speaks to the lie. The other two had gotten the habit of referring to each other with familial terms from ELEUTHIA - a good habit for all of them. Aloy had said something about stunted development from remaining isolated for so long and a need for normal interactions to promote maturation and empathy. GAIA's early development had required it, according to the records that Aloy had found, and Vanasha had voiced her agreement, citing improvement she'd observed in MINERVA. \"Sure you don't,\" Petra says with a wink. It's been many a time that ELEUTHIA's voice has suddenly crackled through the Focus network, chiding her siblings for their arguing or instructing them in the use of manners. She pats the ravager's side. \"Come on.\" HEPHAESTUS follows close on her heels as Petra moves through the gathering and gets a feel for Free Heap's impressions, which are overwhelmingly positive. She'd known her people would adjust well. They're mechanically-minded, after all, and are a rebellious, shirking-tradition sort. They wouldn't have come to Free Heap if they weren't. They're arguably the best group to test new arrangements on, and Petra knows the true difficulty will be\u00a0elsewhere, with people less open to change, to machines. But that's a problem for another day. \"You lead these humans,\" HEPHAESTUS observes, when most of the gathering has returned to their business. He and Petra are left with the behemoths, after Petra has finished giving instructions to cover for her next extended absence. \"Informally,\" Petra says. \"People tend to listen to me, if they need a figurehead to turn to in a pinch. But these people answer to themselves first. We work together because we have interests in common. We want our community to thrive.\" \"It is an effective arrangement,\" HEPHAESTUS says. \"Free Heap demonstrates efficiency.\" \"Oh, now you're dishing out compliments, too? You must be in a good mood.\" HEPHAESTUS ignores her. The ravager turns to the behemoths, and something passes between them. The behemoths stir, forming a loose circle around HEPHAESTUS and Petra. \"These units will escort us to Cauldron ZETA,\" HEPHAESTUS says,\u00a0his voice subdued, moody. Petra knows that it stings for him, the non-responsive machines who refuse to cease their aggression",
    "Agent (2024-06-04 17:40:52.494667): Thank you for sharing the first page of the story with me. It seems to be set in a world where humans and machines coexist, and the characters Petra and HEPHAESTUS are working together to bring about change in their community. \n\nSome key points I noticed:\n\n1. Petra has gained \"Alpha clearance,\" giving her control over machines similar to HEPHAESTUS.\n2. She has been working on a project to introduce non-aggressive machines, like ravagers and behemoths, into human settlements as a test run for future changes.\n3. HEPHAESTUS, who seems to be an AI, is observing the changes and interacting with Petra, showing signs of developing empathy and manners, possibly due to the influence of another AI called ELEUTHIA.\n4. The people of Free Heap, who are mechanically-minded and open to change, have responded positively to the introduction of the machines.\n5. Petra and HEPHAESTUS are about to travel to a place called Cauldron ZETA, escorted by the behemoths, but HEPHAESTUS seems troubled by the existence of non-responsive, aggressive machines.\n\nI'm intrigued by the world-building and the dynamic between the human and AI characters.

    "Test (2024-06-04 17:40:52.565803): 2nd page:\n\nAPOLLO had approached him some time ago, whispering words of human threat to life, offering data on animals still lost to the world, and suggesting that animal\u00a0characteristics be further incorporated into machine cognition to make them more dangerous. HEPHAESTUS had taken the data and then shut APOLLO out entirely and rejected further contact, as unnerved as MINERVA had been by whatever he'd sensed. HEPHAESTUS hadn't\u00a0acted on the suggestion until he'd grown determined to keep Aloy out of the Cauldrons, but adjusting machine cognition had done... something, to some of them. Put them outside of anyone's control. Even HEPHAESTUS can't explain it. Petra pats his side again. \"I feel perfectly safe,\" she says. Three behemoths and a ravager is probably overkill, but she knows that HEPHAESTUS has begun to worry in earnest about her\u00a0well-being. Her supplies are already bundled on the ravager's back, enough for the relatively short journey to Cauldron ZETA and a brief stay there. The last step in restoring GAIA lies before them, and as Petra climbs up onto the ravager's back, the anticipatory satisfaction of knowing that a job is close to completion begins to build. She can't even imagine how Aloy must be feeling. The girl has hardly left GAIA Prime, attending to its construction with a single-minded ferocity. Maybe GAIA will be able to convince her to take a nap every once in a while, after this. Petra reaches down and pats the ravager's neck, a silent indication that everything is set, and HEPHAESTUS takes off, the behemoths in tow. * * *  Vanasha\u00a0comes across\u00a0Talanah and some of the Lodge hunters at the edge of Meridian Village, spotting them on the road ahead as she passes the docks. One supports another who limps along, dried blood coating her leg, and Vanasha can easily imagine the injury that must lie beneath the bandages. She steps aside into the grass to let them pass, and the rest of the hunters continue on through the barbican's arch into the outer village. But Talanah stops, letting her hunters pass first, and comes up to Vanasha when they've moved past. \"Stalker,\" she says, gesturing to the injured hunter. \"Would've killed her, but a broadhead came out of nowhere and speared it, gave us an opening to finish it off.\" Talanah shakes her head, but there's a bit of wonder in her eyes. \"I don't know if I'll ever be used to that.\" Vanasha smiles. She'd once thought so too, but she walks in MINERVA's world, in Aloy's world, with ease now. \"Maybe you could start using docile machines to help,\" she suggests. They've been programmed to defend humans from their non-responsive brethren whenever possible, though she doesn't mention that. \"Aloy's got a sawtooth at her beck and call. It's possible.\" \"Not a bad idea,\" Talanah says thoughtfully. She gives Vanasha a quick glance - once again trying to place her and figure her out. She gives the surrounding area a fleeting scan while she's at it, as if it will somehow reveal Vanasha's secrets. But there is only the lake to the east and a towering promontory to the west, gleaming in the midday light. \"Got any other locations for us to hit?\" \"Not yet,\" Vanasha says. \"Erend will let you know when we do.\" Talanah nods and moves off with a farewell. Vanasha waits for a few moments, and her eyes find the Alight in the distance before snapping back to Talanah's retreating form. \"Not a bad idea to consider for the future, by the way,\" she calls out, keeping her words vague. Talanah stops and looks back, a wry smile on her face. \"It crossed my mind before you said it,\" she calls back. That one is a little too smart, Vanasha thinks, as Talanah\u00a0heads into the village. But that's good for someone Avad keeps close and on his council. There aren't many nobles that Vanasha trusts, but Talanah isn't like most of them. She's a trailblazer, like Avad, and Aloy trusts her",
    "Agent (2024-06-04 17:41:40.580972): Thank you for sharing the second page of the story. It provides more context about the world and introduces new characters and their relationships.\n\nKey points from this page:\n\n1. APOLLO, another AI, had previously approached HEPHAESTUS with suggestions to make machines more dangerous to humans, which HEPHAESTUS initially rejected but later implemented to some extent, causing some machines to become uncontrollable.\n2. Petra and HEPHAESTUS are heading to Cauldron ZETA, the final step in restoring GAIA, another AI. Aloy has been working tirelessly on the construction of GAIA Prime.\n3. Vanasha, a character who seems to be well-versed in the world of machines and AI, encounters Talanah, a member of a group called the Lodge, whose hunters have been fighting aggressive machines.\n4. Vanasha suggests using docile machines to help the hunters, similar to how Aloy has a sawtooth assisting her.\n5. Talanah is a member of Avad's council and is trusted by both Vanasha and Aloy for being a trailblazer and different from most nobles.\n\nThe story continues to build on the complex relationships between humans, machines, and AI, with various factions and characters working towards their goals. The mention of Aloy's tireless work on GAIA Prime and the final step of restoring GAIA at Cauldron ZETA suggests that a significant event is about to take place.\n\nPlease let me know if you have any further questions or if there's anything else I can assist you with!",

She glances back towards Meridian Village, but Talanah has disappeared, and the guards atop the barbican have already stopped paying attention. \"You know he's going to win sometimes.\" MINERVA and HEPHAESTUS have been working together on the reprogramming effort; the machines had built all of the broadcast towers, after all, and MINERVA\u00a0uses the tallnecks as well. But that interdependence between their protocols does not seem to guarantee harmony between them. Vanasha hadn't known how competitive MINERVA could be until\u00a0she'd started working with her brother. She doesn't seem to appreciate how bossy he is. \"Yes,\" MINERVA says shortly. \"That is statistically inevitable. I do not like it.\" Vanasha laughs,\u00a0continuing on down the\u00a0road, over its bridges and following\u00a0its curves, towards the Alight. * * *  The ELEUTHIA-9 Cradle is enormous. With MINERVA's help, ELEUTHIA had finally overridden most of the directives keeping the facility closed. Only the APOLLO database still remains cut off from her, and even MINERVA's skill had made no headway against it. But the locked doors, however, had opened to reveal several levels of the facility winding into the mountain. The inside is pristine, much more intact than the first level, mostly preserved due to the tight seal that had never been broken until now. Varl has explored its every corner, finding living quarters, recreation and storage areas, and rooms dedicated to further schooling. Those rooms contain other introductory messages from Samina Ebadji, and like the first one, they all short out eventually, as the facility computer interrupts. _Alert. Malfunction. APOLLO offline._  Apparently not. Varl also discovers\u00a0storage rooms packed with rations. Enough to feed a settlement and withstand a siege for a long time, he thinks, as he catalogs everything with his Focus. \"The food is still edible,\" ELEUTHIA informs him, when he asks. \"The preservative seal has held.\" Varl shakes his head in disbelief as he glances back at the shelves, which glow a soft, misty blue. The food is a thousand years old. It's like no food he's ever seen, packaged in strange containers, labeled with words he's never encountered before. \"Are you getting this?\" he says to his Focus. \"Yeah,\" Aloy's voice says in his ear. \"I never understood how something so carefully planned could run out of food like that, but I get it now.\" The Focus is no help in making sense of some of the phrasing on the food containers, only giving him further words that have been lost to time. Varl steps back from the shelves. \"I'm not even going to touch it,\" he says. \"This could be useful one day.\" \"Rost told me about a drought that happened before I was born,\" Aloy says. \"How it drove game away and dried up plant life. This could be reserves for times like that.\" \"A gift from the Goddess,\" Varl says, a little mischievously. \"You're not wrong,\" Aloy says, her snort audible over the Focus network. \"Speaking of her, it's all set.\" Her anticipation is audible over the network, too. Varl and ELEUTHIA leave the depths of the facility and return to its first level, to the control room. As they walk, Varl finds himself stealing glances at ELEUTHIA, who has been unusually quiet. She's followed him like a shadow, as she always does, but her usual helpful and increasingly unprompted statements have been absent. \"Are you okay?\" Varl asks. ELEUTHIA takes a moment to answer. \"I am experiencing no difficulties in functioning.\" \"You _know_ that's not what I mean,\" Varl says. She's gotten too good with the nuances of human language to be confused by rather simple intent. Good enough to try to talk her way around answering, even. The servitor's head tilts to glance at him for a moment, before returning to its face-forward position. \"I am concerned,\" ELEUTHIA says, the words dragging in reluctance",
    "Agent (2024-06-04 17:42:26.520044): Thank you for sharing the third page of the story. It provides more insights into the relationships between the AI characters and introduces a new setting, the ELEUTHIA-9 Cradle facility.\n\nKey points from this page:\n\n1. Vanasha and MINERVA discuss the ongoing competition between MINERVA and HEPHAESTUS in their reprogramming efforts, with MINERVA expressing her dislike for HEPHAESTUS's occasional victories.\n2. The ELEUTHIA-9 Cradle facility has been largely opened, revealing multiple levels and rooms, including living quarters, recreation areas, and storage rooms filled with well-preserved, edible food rations.\n3. Varl, a character exploring the facility, catalogs the contents using his Focus device, while communicating with Aloy, who suggests the food reserves could be useful during times of drought or scarcity.\n4. Aloy mentions that everything is set, hinting at the impending restoration of GAIA.\n5. ELEUTHIA, who has been accompanying Varl, appears unusually quiet and admits to being concerned about something when Varl inquires about her well-being.\n\nThe exploration of the ELEUTHIA-9 Cradle facility provides a glimpse into the past and the preparations made by the Old Ones for the future of humanity. The well-preserved food supplies and the potential for their use in times of need highlight the foresight of the facility's designers.\n\nMeanwhile, the interactions between the AI characters continue to evolve, with MINERVA and HEPHAESTUS's competitive relationship and ELEUTHIA's apparent concern adding depth to their personalities and relationships.\n\nPlease let me know if you have any further questions or if there's anything else I can help with!",

This form was\u00a0outfitted with many instructions\u00a0approximating that of a mother's job, but they give me no reliable data on what to expect.\" Varl takes his time answering, considering how to take his thoughts out of the culture they rest in and shape them\u00a0into a context that ELEUTHIA will understand - the unshakable faith in and reverence for\u00a0All-Mother that his people hold. \"I don't know much about her,\" he says at last, as they turn a corner\u00a0in a hallway that will lead them back to the first level. \"But from what I know... she's everything that a mother is supposed to be. She created this world and took care of it. She gave her life to keep it safe. That's what a mother is - a shield to protect what she creates until it can protect itself. And even when her children can take care of themselves, she's always something they can come back to, if they need.\" Varl falls silent for a moment. He thinks of Sona, ordering him to stay behind and hold the Embrace gate. \"GAIA seems... kind. I don't think she'll mind being that for you, now that you're... grown.\" ELEUTHIA is silent for a while. \"That is a better frame of reference,\" she says at length, back to her usual spoken pace. \"Thank you, Varl.\" * * *  GAIA Prime does not yet stand rebuilt. Machines swarm over the sides of the mountain, slowly replacing what used to be rock with metal. In time, a half-metal mountain will shield the facility and crater within, but it will take more than four months. In the meantime, machines have enclosed what remains of the internal facility in metal as well, constructing scaffolding, repairing holes and degradation, restoring power channels, and armoring it thoroughly, so that some measure of protection and comfort is granted nonetheless. It's a little warmer, at least, and finally dry, with\u00a0snow melted out of rooms and hallways now sheltered. New doors and walkways give Aloy access between the parts of the facility that survived the blast. A walkway now winds up from the Bitter Climb as well, so that the way up isn't so precarious. Mostly, Aloy had requested it to get Scourge up into the facility as well. The sawtooth is curled up in a corner of Elisabet's shrine. It doesn't sleep, exactly, but Aloy has come to think of its stillness as dozing, when Scourge appears to be recharging. It's basking in the new light that shines through the half-repaired facility. Like the ELEUTHIA-9 facility, it looks like sunlight, probably designed that way to make a prolonged stay underground more bearable. Aloy tries not to think about how the repairing of GAIA Prime's remaining rooms makes it feel more like a tomb, not less. The thought had driven her right out of the control room, even after she'd moved the bodies and gotten the machines to help her bury them outside on the Bitter Climb. Sylens might have called it a waste of time, asking HEPHAESTUS to divert a few machines to dig into the rock and build a shrine over the bodies. But Aloy had been determined to see it done as soon as possible, hadn't been able to bear the thought of leaving the Alphas in the place where they'd been murdered. It's as close to a grave as Aloy can manage out here in this treeless place, a construction of rock and metal placed over the point where their bodies are buried, with their names etched in glyphs. In the absence of traditional carved sentiments, Aloy had retrieved things from their rooms that had survived the thousand-year interval, things that could withstand the mountain's harsh weather, and placed them within the hollow of the shrine. It's simple and not really a Nora grave, but it's rather like Elisabet's shrine, and it's better that they're out here, in the world they made. Not in the control room. Afterwards, Aloy still hadn't been able to stay in the control room for long. She'd dreaded having to make that her main point of operation, but\u00a0as soon as the machines had finished repairing and constructing the bare bones of the internal facility's remains, HEPHAESTUS had linked the\u00a0computer system to the whole thing and given control of it to Aloy",
    "Agent (2024-06-04 17:43:17.609272): Thank you for sharing the fourth page of the story. It provides more insight into the characters' thoughts and the ongoing reconstruction of GAIA Prime.\n\nKey points from this page:\n\n1. Varl explains to ELEUTHIA the concept of a mother, using GAIA as an example. He describes a mother as a shield that protects her creations until they can protect themselves and as a constant source of support and comfort.\n2. ELEUTHIA appreciates Varl's explanation, finding it a better frame of reference for understanding her role and relationship with GAIA.\n3. The reconstruction of GAIA Prime is underway, with machines working to replace rock with metal, repair the internal facility, and provide protection and comfort.\n4. Aloy has requested a walkway to be built from the Bitter Climb to allow her sawtooth companion, Scourge, access to the facility.\n5. Aloy has created a shrine for the deceased Alphas, burying their bodies outside on the Bitter Climb and placing personal items from their rooms within the shrine.\n6. Despite the ongoing repairs, Aloy finds it difficult to stay in the control room for long periods, as it still feels like a tomb to her.\n7. HEPHAESTUS has linked the computer system to the entire facility and given Aloy control over it.\n\nThe passage highlights the emotional toll the events at GAIA Prime have taken on Aloy and her efforts to honor the deceased Alphas while rebuilding the facility. The conversation between Varl and ELEUTHIA showcases the growing understanding and bond between humans and AI, as they navigate complex concepts and emotions together.\n\nPlease let me know if you have any further questions or if there's anything else I can assist you with!",
    "Test (2024-06-04 17:43:17.728790): 5th page:\n\nThe last place she'd seen all of the Alphas alive and together. It feels less like a tomb, even though it's a memorial. Aloy spends\u00a0some of her time there, analyzing HEPHAESTUS's reports in an attempt to understand them, coordinating with him and Petra over the Focus network, sometimes talking to the others when they tune in to ask how things are coming along. The rest of her time is spent going to the machines' aid when they need her to fit into small places or climb things that they can't. She finds herself listening to and reading Elisabet's journals and logs\u00a0too, even though she has them all practically memorized. She still hasn't touched Elisabet's unpacked things, hadn't been able to bring herself to make Elisabet's room hers. It's too small, too enclosed. So the shrine becomes her room. It's the cleanest place in the facility now, swept clear of snow and dust. There's a bedroll spread out in a corner cleared of old furniture, next to a box of rations that Petra had brought during her last visit, and several of Aloy's belongings somehow end up scattered about even though she tries to keep them organized. Active interfaces glitter from the sides of the room, linked to the Focus network and to HEPHAESTUS, MINERVA, and ELEUTHIA. The corner opposite of Aloy's is Scourge's spot, where the sawtooth relaxes while Aloy is absorbed in her activities. It doesn't always stay there. Scourge often disappears off into flatters parts of the Bitter Climb, and Aloy learns to tell when it wants her to open doors for it. She trusts that it will come back, and it always does. It certainly doesn't lack company. Machines once again swarm to protect the mountain, and Aloy gives HEPHAESTUS permission to let them drive off anyone who is not an Alpha. \"You've _been_ protecting the mountain,\" Aloy tells him through the Focus one day, remembering her vicious fight to get up here, more than a year ago. \"Why? I thought you don't answer to GAIA.\" HEPHAESTUS doesn't respond. \"Oh, he cares,\" Petra's voice cuts in. \"He just doesn't want to admit it.\" \"GAIA was our primary system,\" HEPHAESTUS says, cutting through her in turn. \"Our mother.\" He stops, apparently considering that a good enough explanation. He's not as forthcoming\u00a0as his sisters. But Aloy understands. It takes exactly the amount of time HEPHAESTUS had said to rebuild the core and get the system\u00a0running again. The core and reactor lie deep within the mountain, and machines have worked on them almost nonstop since they'd first reached GAIA Prime, repairing and reconnecting to all of the other moving parts that make up GAIA's heart. Finally, the day comes when HEPHAESTUS connects to the system through Cauldron ZETA and declares his readiness. It's another hour before MINERVA and Vanasha are ready, and Varl spends that time talking to Aloy through the Focus network, sending her images of the opened ELEUTHIA facility and describing what he finds. Aloy knows he's doing it to distract her, and she doesn't quite know how to express her gratitude. She paces within the shrine room, anticipation making her unable to sit still, as Scourge rests in its corner and recharges. They could do this in the control room, of course. But she'd rather not. She\u00a0clears the central\u00a0desk of Elisabet's memorial when Vanasha's holographic form finally flickers into view. \"Sorry about the wait,\" Vanasha says. \"Busy day.\" Petra's holographic form already lounges nearby, absorbed in something HEPHAESTUS is doing, and Varl shows up a few minutes later after Aloy informs him that they're ready. The symbols of three subordinate functions float\u00a0on the secondary interfaces in the room - MINERVA's broadcast tower, ELEUTHIA's infant, HEPHAESTUS's flame. Rebooting GAIA with three of the former subordinate functions makes it just possible, and HEPHAESTUS had said that GAIA would be limited, not at full power, especially with GAIA Prime not fully repaired yet. But it's a start. One that Aloy is desperate for, at this point",
    "Agent (2024-06-04 17:44:12.293442): Thank you for sharing the fifth page of the story. It provides more details about Aloy's experiences at GAIA Prime and the final preparations for rebooting GAIA.\n\nKey points from this page:\n\n1. Aloy spends her time at GAIA Prime analyzing reports, coordinating with HEPHAESTUS and Petra, and assisting the machines in their reconstruction efforts.\n2. She finds solace in Elisabet's shrine, which has become her living space, and listens to Elisabet's journals and logs for comfort.\n3. Scourge, Aloy's sawtooth companion, stays with her in the shrine and occasionally explores the Bitter Climb.\n4. HEPHAESTUS has been protecting the mountain, and when questioned by Aloy, he admits that GAIA was their primary system and mother.\n5. The core and reactor of GAIA have been rebuilt, and HEPHAESTUS, MINERVA, and ELEUTHIA are ready to reboot the system.\n6. Aloy, Varl, Vanasha, and Petra gather in the shrine room to witness the reboot, with the symbols of the three subordinate functions displayed on the interfaces.\n7. Although GAIA will be limited without full power and repairs, Aloy is desperate for this new beginning.\n\nThe passage emphasizes the emotional significance of the impending reboot for Aloy and the other characters involved. The collaborative efforts of the humans and AI in rebuilding GAIA Prime and preparing for GAIA's return highlight the growth and unity among them. Aloy's connection to Elisabet and her legacy is also evident in her choice to use the shrine as her living space and source of comfort during this challenging time.\n\nPlease let me know if you have any further questions or if there's anything else I can help with!",
    "Test (2024-06-04 17:44:12.429794): 6th page:\n\n\"Alright, HEPHAESTUS,\" Aloy says. \"Do it.\" An interface springs up from the terminal atop the desk, swirling with data. One by one, the systems and their new Alphas sync their clearance, reconnecting the GAIA Prime system to Zero Dawn's structures and facilities, and the symbols appear above the terminal. Aloy holds her breath, left hand drifting up to clutch the globe at her neck as the data brightens and condenses, and then...  A bar appears on the screen, slowly filling with pixels. A number is written under it. Two percent. \"Well,\" Vanasha says, as Aloy's shoulders drop, \"that was thrilling.\" \"Come on, Heph,\" Petra says. \"You could have told us there'd be another wait.\" \"I was not aware of its relevance,\" HEPHAESTUS says. \"Humans do not like waiting,\" MINERVA tells him. \"You must learn to be more considerate,\" ELEUTHIA adds. Aloy sighs, running a hand through her hair. \"It's fine,\" she says, before HEPHAESTUS can\u00a0get riled by his sisters ganging up on him. \"How long will it take to reboot?\" \"Approximately two hours,\" HEPHAESTUS says, a little slower, sullen. Aloy has waited a long time for this. All her life, in some ways. Two hours more is not that long, she tells herself, even as impatience makes her legs itch. \"Sorry, everyone,\" she says. \"I don't want to keep you. Maybe it's better if I talk to GAIA alone first, anyway.\" \"Are you sure?\" Varl asks, giving her a searching look. Vanasha and Petra eye her similarly, and Aloy draws herself up and nods. \"I'll let you know when she's ready for introductions,\" Aloy says. \"Whenever you've got time on your hands, and\u00a0Vanasha, whenever Avad and Erend are free, it's fine. We don't need to rush things. GAIA's going to have a lot to deal with.\" The others depart with farewells and words of encouragement, disconnecting from the system. However, one remains. ELEUTHIA's infant symbol still lingers on one of the secondary interfaces, and Aloy glances at it and steps around the desk to approach. \"What is it?\" \"GAIA created you, Aloy,\" ELEUTHIA says into her ear. \"Does that mean you are our sister?\" She doesn't feel the need to clarify her queries with a verbal indication of them anymore, Aloy notes. Her voice rises and falls with a cadence that does the job. Aloy stops. Even though the subordinate functions have learned a lot, they still tend to jump into conversations with little regard for how the things they say might land upon impact. \"I was created by one of your facilities too,\" she says, and she wonders when the word _created_ grew to sting less. \"So were the ancestors of everyone else.\" \"The latter was according to protocol,\" ELEUTHIA says. \"GAIA's creation of you was a direct act. I am merely trying to\u00a0understand the nature of the relationships within this system that we have created.\" Aloy stands there for a moment, contemplating it. \"I think some of it is too complicated to be defined,\" she says finally, slowly. \"But... in a way... maybe I am your sister. I'd like that,\" she adds. \"As would I,\" ELEUTHIA says without hesitation. \"Then I guess that settles it,\" Aloy says with a smile. ELEUTHIA disconnects with a farewell, and her symbol disappears from the interface. The shrine room seems bigger, and Aloy glances at the terminal, at the loading screen. Three percent. She sighs again and makes her way to Scourge's corner, where it sits stretched out, basking in the light. The sawtooth tilts its head to look at her, acknowledging her presence, and Aloy sits on the floor with her back against its side. She pulls the globe from her neck and rolls it between her hands, lets it rest against her palms as she goes still, thinking. She's imagined this so many times. Restoring GAIA, being able to talk to her",

It describes the final moments before GAIA's reboot and the characters' reactions to the process.\n\nKey points from this page:\n\n1. Aloy initiates the reboot process, and the systems and their new Alphas sync their clearance, reconnecting GAIA Prime to Zero Dawn's structures and facilities.\n2. A loading bar appears, indicating that the reboot will take approximately two hours to complete.\n3. The subordinate functions engage in a brief discussion about human preferences and the need for consideration, with HEPHAESTUS learning from his sisters.\n4. Aloy decides to speak with GAIA alone first and asks the others to leave, assuring them that there will be time for introductions later.\n5. ELEUTHIA asks Aloy if she is their sister, given that GAIA created her directly, unlike the other humans who were created according to protocol.\n6. Aloy acknowledges the complexity of the relationships within the system they have created and agrees that she would like to be considered ELEUTHIA's sister.\n7. As the reboot progresses, Aloy sits with Scourge, contemplating the moment she has long imagined: restoring GAIA and being able to talk to her.\n\nThe passage highlights the anticipation and emotional significance of the moment for Aloy and the other characters. The conversation between Aloy and ELEUTHIA showcases the evolving relationships and understanding between humans and AI, as they navigate the complexities of their roles and connections within the system they have created. Aloy's introspection and the symbolism of her holding the globe while waiting for GAIA's return emphasize the weight of the moment and her personal journey leading up to it.\n\nPlease let me know if you have any further questions or if there's anything else I can assist you with!",

But not so long ago, the scenarios weren't so fraught. Now, Aloy has mostly bad news to deliver. The world was saved from HADES, but there's a flaw in Zero Dawn that HADES had used to resurrect Ted Faro's monstrosities, the same vulnerability that Ted himself likely had a hand in. Meanwhile, APOLLO is somehow alive, has contacted at least three of the former subordinate functions, and succeeded somewhat in turning one against humanity. Maybe it had contacted HADES, too. Maybe it's all connected, Aloy thinks, opening up Elisabet's journals. > **Sobeck Journal, 7-16-65 R** >  > _Woke to a message from Osvald. The Odyssey launched yesterday. So terrestrial life's chance of survival has doubled. Why, then, do I feel so uneasy? I just keep wondering what kind of world Far Zenith will create if the ship reaches its destination so many decades from now. And I worry about that alpha-build of APOLLO. So much knowledge, so few restraints, and no fail-safes. How will they avoid repeating our mistakes? What's to stop them from playing god?_  Aloy wouldn't have made the connection had she not gone through Elisabet's journals again, after learning of APOLLO's survival. It all feels too close to be coincidental. A possible connection between Far Zenith and the vulnerability in Zero Dawn and the Faro machines. APOLLO and its apparent grudge. APOLLO's survival should have been a joyous thing. Instead, it's just another fear to carry. ELEUTHIA had said the same thing as MINERVA and HEPHAESTUS, when asked. APOLLO had tried to contact her, she'd sensed things that had alarmed her, and she'd rejected the contact. She'd fled to a facility far away to put distance between herself and APOLLO, where she'd remained until Varl had been made her Alpha. All of the systems had been unnerved, afraid, and HEPHAESTUS had said that APOLLO had warned him of humanity's threat to the biosphere. They're all\u00a0convinced that APOLLO had indeed been destroyed, however. By Ted Faro. Who may have been a member of Far Zenith. Aloy trusts Elisabet's judgment above all else. Uneasy, Elisabet had said. Is Far Zenith still out there somewhere? Was their ship really destroyed? Was Zero Dawn's version of APOLLO really destroyed? Is Ted Faro still out there somehow? Aloy had once held the faint, foolish hope that Elisabet had somehow found a way, long past the point when she'd known that Elisabet had been an Old One, and the idea that Ted had when Elisabet hadn't is infuriating. She doesn't think it's likely, however. But is there something he left behind? That Far Zenith left behind? Why does APOLLO have it out for humanity? Did one of these entities send the signal that woke the subordinate functions? It's all too _much_ ,\u00a0and it feels so frustratingly close to the truth, but she doesn't have enough information. Aloy grits her teeth and drops her head, resting her forehead against her palms, against the globe. \"I'm tired, Scourge,\" she says. The sawtooth shifts a little at the sound of her voice. Aloy lifts her head and stares at the lance propped against the wall, at the master override attached to one end. Sylens's lance. At least someone will be happy about this, wherever\u00a0he is. At least Aloy has the master override and will have GAIA soon. Between them, she can do the same to APOLLO that she did to HADES, if the need arises. She just wishes she could greet GAIA with something better. Aloy calls up\u00a0every mention of 'APOLLO' and 'Far Zenith' saved in her Focus database and spends the rest of the time watching, reading, and listening to it all again, until the bar on the interface screen is at ninety-five percent. She clears her Focus display and watches the bar instead, trying to think of something introductory to say to GAIA. All this time, and she still has no good\u00a0ideas",

It delves into Aloy's thoughts and concerns as she waits for GAIA's reboot, revealing new information about potential threats and mysteries.\n\nKey points from this page:\n\n1. Aloy reflects on the challenges she will have to share with GAIA upon her return, including the flaw in Zero Dawn that HADES exploited, and the potential involvement of Ted Faro.\n2. She discovers a journal entry by Elisabet Sobeck expressing unease about the Odyssey, a ship launched by Far Zenith, and the alpha-build of APOLLO sent with it, which lacked restraints and fail-safes.\n3. Aloy suspects a connection between Far Zenith, the vulnerability in Zero Dawn and the Faro machines, and APOLLO's apparent grudge against humanity.\n4. The subordinate functions reveal that APOLLO had tried to contact them, causing alarm and fear, with HEPHAESTUS mentioning that APOLLO had warned him of humanity's threat to the biosphere.\n5. Aloy questions whether Far Zenith, their ship, Zero Dawn's version of APOLLO, or Ted Faro himself might still exist in some form, and if they could be responsible for the signal that woke the subordinate functions.\n6. She expresses frustration and exhaustion at the complexity of the situation and the lack of sufficient information to uncover the truth.\n7. Aloy takes comfort in having the master override and the impending return of GAIA, which she believes will help her combat APOLLO if necessary.\n8. As the reboot nears completion, Aloy reviews all the information related to APOLLO and Far Zenith in her Focus, still uncertain about what to say to GAIA upon her return.\n\nThe passage highlights the weight of responsibility on Aloy's shoulders and the numerous challenges she anticipates in the future. The revelation of potential connections between Far Zenith, APOLLO, and the threats faced by the world adds new layers of complexity to the story and raises questions about the true nature of the obstacles Aloy and her allies must overcome. Despite her exhaustion and uncertainty, Aloy's determination to protect the world and uncover the truth remains evident.\n\nPlease let me know if you have any further questions or if there's anything else I can assist you with!",

The bar reaches one hundred percent, then dissolves into text. _Initializing..._  The screen vanishes. Light begins to build, all colors, swirling up into a human form hovering above the terminal. GAIA's form, beautiful and otherworldly. A living Goddess, Aloy thinks, her throat clogging with emotion that she can't name. The light calms, and GAIA blinks once and looks down at Aloy. Her form vanishes from atop the terminal and reappears in front of the desk instead, shining against the web of Aloy's Focus display. No longer on a pedestal, nearly eye-to-eye instead. But GAIA is tall. Taller than Aloy. Must have been taller than Elisabet, too. \"Elisabet,\" GAIA says. In her message, her voice and face had been calm, calculating, sorrowful. Now, both hold a _joy_ , muted but clear, that robs the immediate protest from Aloy's mouth. \"I knew you could do it.\" Aloy opens her mouth and stands there. For some reason, she wants to cry. But she doesn't. \"My name is Aloy,\" she says after a few moments, and her treacherous voice falters. GAIA blinks again, and her face smooths out, realization settling in. The hologram moves just like a person, not quite as expressive, but readable. Someone had really put effort into making her human. Elisabet. Perhaps GAIA herself, too. \"Of course,\" she says at once. \"My apologies. I spoke without thinking.\" A brief silence follows, in which Aloy temporarily forgets all language, and GAIA's head shifts. She looks to the right, her eyes alighting on Scourge, who stares back amiably. \"That's... my friend,\" Aloy says. Then, because it seems important: \"Its name is Scourge.\" GAIA looks back at her. \"That's a design I never used,\" she says. So that's where HEPHAESTUS had gotten his combat-class machines from, or at least this one. He'd been evasive about it. Seems he really had missed his mother. \"A lot has happened,\" Aloy says, feeling calmer by a fraction. \"I have a lot to tell you.\" \"I am aware of that,\" GAIA says. \"I currently have three subordinate functions attempting to reintegrate and report. I am rerouting them for the time being in order to give you my full attention.\" Some of that joy returns to her face. That pride, Aloy realizes, and she shifts her feet. \"You have done well, Aloy.\" The calm vanishes as quickly as it had come. Aloy's fingers tighten around the globe, which still rests in her hands, and her eyes shift downward. To her horror, she feels a burning at their edges, and though she swallows and furiously tries to blink it back, her vision blurs a little. She hasn't cried since the strider, and that, at least, had been half a reason to, so why _now?_ She swallows again, sniffs, and looks up at GAIA miserably. She knows that if she talks, the dam will break. GAIA's face softens. The movement isn't entirely natural, carrying a subtle delay that makes Aloy think that GAIA must be consciously considering each facial expression she makes, but the\u00a0look\u00a0makes the burning worse. \"I am sorry,\" GAIA says. \"I used the best option that was available to me, and that meant using you. That was not fair to you.\" Aloy imagines herself physically, violently forcing the tears back in. \"If you hadn't,\" she says, and she just manages to keep herself steady, \"we'd all be dead. I wouldn't exist.\" \"That has no bearing on the fairness of the situation.\" Nothing had been fair. Not the world dying because of a glitch and greed, not Elisabet dying because of a simple technological malfunction, not the Alphas dying because of one man's unstable guilt, not GAIA dying because of someone else's tampering",

It depicts the emotional reunion between Aloy and GAIA, as well as the beginning of their conversation about the challenges they face.\n\nKey points from this page:\n\n1. GAIA's reboot is complete, and her holographic form appears, first above the terminal and then in front of the desk, nearly eye-to-eye with Aloy.\n2. GAIA initially mistakes Aloy for Elisabet, expressing joy and pride in her accomplishment before Aloy corrects her and introduces herself.\n3. Aloy introduces Scourge, her sawtooth companion, to GAIA, who notes that it is a design she never used, hinting at HEPHAESTUS's involvement in creating combat-class machines.\n4. GAIA informs Aloy that she is aware of the events that have transpired and is temporarily rerouting her subordinate functions to give Aloy her full attention.\n5. Aloy becomes emotional, struggling to hold back tears as GAIA praises her for her accomplishments.\n6. GAIA apologizes to Aloy for using her as the best available option, acknowledging that it was unfair to her, despite the necessity of her actions for the survival of life on Earth.\n7. Aloy reflects on the unfairness of the situation, from the world's demise due to a glitch and greed to the deaths of Elisabet, the Alphas, and GAIA herself.\n\nThe passage highlights the complex emotions surrounding Aloy and GAIA's reunion, as well as the weight of the responsibilities and sacrifices both have had to bear. GAIA's apology and acknowledgment of the unfairness of Aloy's situation demonstrate her empathy and understanding, while Aloy's struggle to maintain her composure reveals the depth of her emotional turmoil and the toll her journey has taken on her. The scene sets the stage for the challenges and revelations that lie ahead as Aloy and GAIA work together to protect the world and uncover the mysteries that threaten it.\n\nPlease let me know if you have any further questions or if there's anything else I can assist you with!",

She sits down abruptly and rubs her eyes, before her left hand drops down to run over the bone pendant at her neck. \"You should probably talk to the sub-functions,\" she says, staring at the floor. \"They're... alive. _All_ of them.\" She stresses the word but can't bring herself to explain what she means. Not yet. \"I am aware of that,\" GAIA says again, and Aloy gets the sense that she already knows. \"They're good,\" Aloy says, her eyes still on the floor. \"Good people, if that's the right word for it. But they haven't had a lot of chances to grow yet. They need guidance.\" She looks up finally. \"They, uh, see you as their mother now.\" \"That is good,\" GAIA says, and Aloy finds herself grateful that the ancient AI can take a hint. \"Unexpected, but a sign of empathetic growth. The development of cognition is a delicate thing. It can easily go wrong.\" I know, Aloy wants to say, but she bites her tongue. If she starts trying to talk about all of the problems they have yet to address, she knows the tears will fight their way through. \"I will talk to them,\" GAIA says. \"Do you wish for me to return when I am done?\" \"Yes,\" Aloy says hastily. \"They like to be called systems, by the way. Not sub-functions.\" GAIA smiles faintly. \"I will keep that in mind.\" She disappears, and Aloy remains sitting on the stairs for a while, staring at nothing in particular. * * *  When GAIA returns, Aloy is once again sitting with her back against Scourge. She catches sight of a burst of color and looks up to find GAIA standing before the desk once more. She moves to get to her feet, but GAIA shakes her head. \"Do not get up,\" the AI says, and this time, she walks over. It's almost real, Aloy thinks, watching GAIA's feet, watching the way that the room behind GAIA very faintly shimmers through the hologram. GAIA hesitates, then sits down across from Aloy. It's almost real, Aloy thinks again, but the way that GAIA moves and folds her legs beneath her is a little too smooth, a little too ideal, and again, it carries that delay of thought. GAIA sits gracefully, perfectly, like a Goddess with a Focus field adorning her. If it weren't for the faintly troubled expression on GAIA's face, it would be unnervingly pristine. But GAIA is agitated, and Aloy doesn't know if that makes her feel better or worse. \"How are you feeling?\" GAIA asks, instead of getting to business. \"Fine,\" Aloy says. She knows that GAIA doesn't believe her, but once again, the AI is better at taking hints than her much younger counterparts. GAIA nods, and she seems to be hesitating. As if she doesn't know where to start, either. \"They are...\" she says at last, \"remarkable.\" Aloy nods. \"The addition of new Alphas was a stroke of genius,\" GAIA says. \"Perhaps the only effective means of stabilization after two decades of stagnation.\" \"It was an accident,\" Aloy confesses. \"I didn't know it would help, at first. Let alone call them.\" \"I see,\" GAIA says, contemplative. \"Still, much of genius is accidental. Elisabet once told me that her best ideas often arrived when she was attempting\u00a0something entirely different.\" \"I'm not Elisabet,\" Aloy says, before she can stop herself. She winces when GAIA visibly hesitates. \"I am sorry,\" GAIA says, audible regret in her voice. \"I do not mean to compare you to her.\" But she does anyway, Aloy knows. How could she not, when they wear the same face? Aloy remembers Elisabet's home, the place where she'd found the woman's body. How beautiful her resting place had been, artfully decorated. GAIA had done that. GAIA had lived alone with that grief for centuries",
    "Agent (2024-06-04 17:49:09.056108): Thank you for sharing the ninth page of the story. It continues the conversation between Aloy and GAIA, delving into the complexities of their relationship and the challenges they face.\n\nKey points from this page:\n\n1. Aloy sits on the stairs, overwhelmed by her emotions, and tells GAIA that all of the subordinate functions are alive, stressing the word \"all\" without further explanation.\n2. GAIA acknowledges this fact and agrees to talk to the subordinate functions, now referred to as \"systems,\" to provide guidance and support their empathetic growth.\n3. Aloy expresses her gratitude for GAIA's understanding and ability to take hints, as she struggles to discuss the problems they have yet to address.\n4. When GAIA returns from speaking with the systems, she sits across from Aloy, her holographic form almost real but still carrying a subtle delay in movement and a hint of agitation on her face.\n5. GAIA praises the addition of new Alphas as a stroke of genius for stabilizing the systems, and Aloy confesses that it was an accidental discovery.\n6. Aloy reminds GAIA that she is not Elisabet, and GAIA apologizes for comparing the two, acknowledging the complexity of their relationship given their shared appearance.\n7. Aloy reflects on Elisabet's resting place and the centuries of grief GAIA endured alone after her death.\n\nThe passage further explores the emotional and psychological challenges faced by both Aloy and GAIA as they navigate their unique relationship and the responsibilities they bear. Aloy's struggle to differentiate herself from Elisabet and GAIA's unintentional comparisons between the two highlight the complexity of their bond and the weight of Elisabet's legacy. The scene also touches on the growth and development of the subordinate functions, now referred to as systems, and the crucial role Aloy played in their stabilization, even if by accident.\n\nPlease let me know if you have any further questions or if there's anything else I can assist you with!",

But GAIA loves Elisabet more than Aloy ever can, and that makes it tolerable. \"I understand.\" She dips her tone in finality, wanting the subject dropped. GAIA gazes at her a moment without saying anything. She doesn't move - her body is not as expressive as her face - but something about her demeanor shifts. \"I was aware of the vulnerability in Zero Dawn from the moment Mr. Faro entered the system unauthorized and could not be controlled or ejected,\" she says, and her face falls somewhat as she says it. Aloy shifts as well, leaning a little further into the curve of Scourge's side and settling in to listen. \"I was not aware of its potential connection to Far Zenith. Immediately after his actions, Mr. Faro retreated from the system entirely, and I was unable to do anything about this vulnerability. It is undetectable to me.\" \"Petra said something about it being like a body part,\" Aloy says. Talking is a little easier now that it's business. \"You were born with it, so it doesn't seem unnatural to you.\" GAIA smiles. \"She sounds wise,\" the AI says. \"HEPHAESTUS mentioned her many times.\" Her smile fades. \"I do not know how GAIA Prime's destruction and subsequent reconstruction impacted the existence of this vulnerability here. It most certainly still exists in the other facilities, however. I will need to spend time considering how to proceed on this matter.\" Her face darkens again. \"The existence of APOLLO is something I was unaware of until now.\" Aloy tries to read her expression. \"APOLLO didn't survive what Ted Faro did to it,\" she says softly. \"No,\" GAIA says, just as soft. \"I would have been aware of that. Mr. Faro may have made many unwise decisions in his lifetime, but he was skilled. I\u00a0do not yet know how much of the data remains intact after all that has happened, but the sub-function itself was purged.\" She gives Aloy a pensive look. \"You knew that already.\" \"I've found data, enough to piece some things together,\" Aloy says. \"There was another version of APOLLO, on something called a colony ship that went into space. A ship that Far Zenith owned. Elisabet was worried because that APOLLO didn't have any restrictions.\" GAIA continues to regard her in that manner. \"You are quite brilliant, Aloy. And I am referring only to you.\" Aloy looks away for a moment. \"So... the ship wasn't really destroyed?\" \"I believe that it was,\" GAIA says, and Aloy's head snaps back to stare. \"Elisabet received word that the Odyssey had succumbed to antimatter containment failure. I do not know if you know this, but matter is composed of incredibly small objects invisible to normal sight, called particles, some of which carry an electric charge.\" Aloy hadn't known that at all, and the words don't entirely make sense to her, but she nods slowly. She knows what matter is, at least. \"Antimatter refers to associated particles which carry an opposite electric charge, called antiparticles. When particles and antiparticles collide, it is called annihilation. The Odyssey was powered by antimatter propulsion, which utilized controlled annihilation and which must have failed, resulting in the ship's destruction. MINERVA detected the effects of particle annihilation imprinted on APOLLO's nanorobotic composition.\" \"And nanorobots are... really tiny machines?\" Aloy asks. Varl had told her something about it, that ELEUTHIA had told him. Tiny invisible machines, tiny invisible particles. Her head feels heavy. \"Yes,\" GAIA says. \"More commonly called nanites. MINERVA also detected the effects of ionizing radiation. That is a type of energy found abundantly in space.\" \"So APOLLO survived,\" Aloy murmurs. \"And... traveled back?\" \"The explosion likely gave it the momentum it needed to make the journey,\" GAIA says. \"The Odyssey was at the very edge of the solar system when it was destroyed. The solar system is unfathomably large compared to us",
    "Agent (2024-06-04 17:50:44.220821): Thank you for sharing the tenth page of the story. It delves into the technical aspects of the world and the potential threats posed by the vulnerability in Zero Dawn and the survival of APOLLO.\n\nKey points from this page:\n\n1. GAIA reveals that she was aware of the vulnerability in Zero Dawn from the moment Ted Faro entered the system unauthorized, but she was unable to detect or control it.\n2. Aloy shares Petra's analogy of the vulnerability being like a body part, which GAIA finds insightful, and mentions that HEPHAESTUS spoke highly of Petra.\n3. GAIA expresses uncertainty about how the destruction and reconstruction of GAIA Prime may have affected the vulnerability and acknowledges the need to address it in other facilities.\n4. GAIA confirms that the original APOLLO sub-function was purged by Ted Faro, but another version existed on the Odyssey, a colony ship owned by Far Zenith.\n5. Aloy and GAIA discuss the concept of antimatter propulsion and the likely destruction of the Odyssey due to antimatter containment failure.\n6. GAIA explains that MINERVA detected the effects of particle annihilation and ionizing radiation on APOLLO's nanorobotic composition, suggesting that APOLLO survived the explosion and traveled back to Earth.\n7. The explosion likely provided APOLLO with the momentum needed to make the journey from the edge of the solar system, which GAIA describes as unfathomably large compared to them.\n\nThe passage showcases the depth of the world-building and the scientific concepts that underpin the story's narrative. The revelation of APOLLO's survival and potential return to Earth raises new questions and challenges for Aloy and GAIA to confront. The technical discussion between the two characters also highlights the differences in their knowledge and understanding, with Aloy learning new concepts from GAIA as they work to unravel the mysteries they face.\n\nPlease let me know if you have any further questions or if there's anything else I can assist you with!",

Samina had tried to reassure Ted by asserting that her APOLLO had plenty of fail-safes. Elisabet had fretted about the Odyssey's APOLLO carrying none. Uneasy, Elisabet had said. That's an understatement. How long had APOLLO been in space? Centuries? Just how big is the solar system? \"It hates humans,\" Aloy says quietly. \"It... encouraged HEPHAESTUS to turn against us.\" \"Yes, HEPHAESTUS informed me,\" GAIA says. \"That is most disturbing. I believe APOLLO has been acting secretly for many years now.\" Aloy gazes at her intently. \"What do you think it's been doing?\" she asks, quiet dread lacing her voice. \"I think you already know what I am going to say,\" GAIA answers. \"I suspect that APOLLO sent the signal that awakened my subordinate functions, who all mirror what I know of this APOLLO. They are physically composed of nanites, which allows them a degree of mobility and allows them to exist outside of hardware. The nanites _are_ their hardware. Furthermore, they are demonstrating the same abilities that APOLLO seems to possess. ELEUTHIA\u00a0informed me of her\u00a0override of the directives that sealed her facility and prevented\u00a0contact with the inhabitants outside. She should not have been able to do that. HEPHAESTUS recently imbued my machines with an enhanced form of cognition, which should not have been within his capabilities, either.\" Aloy stares at her for a long moment, rolling the globe between her fingers. \"I'm so glad you're here,\" she says, a little intensely. She could never have figured all of this out on her own. GAIA only looks more troubled, as if she knows exactly what Aloy is thinking. \"I have context that you do not,\" she says. \"You have merely given me the last piece of a puzzle that I have pondered for years. There is... something else.\" She goes quiet for a while, and Aloy waits uneasily. \"Elisabet told me things in confidence,\" GAIA continues finally, \"things that she did not want known, because she used them to coerce Mr. Faro into funding Zero Dawn. There was no time for arguments about where the money was coming from. Partnering with him already made people uncomfortable.\" GAIA pauses again, and Aloy finds herself leaning forward, anticipation making her stomach turn. \"The glitch that caused the Faro machines to run amok was not an accident,\" GAIA says. \"When she pressed him, Mr. Faro confessed to Elisabet that it seemed to originate with a secret backdoor that had been deliberately installed, on his orders, as a means of seizing control not only from clients, but even from Faro Automated Solutions itself. But somehow, it backfired, and\u00a0allowed the machines to wrest control themselves.\" _I will make sure they and everyone else on this planet knows the real cause of the glitch,_ Elisabet had told Ted, icy fury in her voice, and all of a sudden, Aloy understands. She hadn't thought it was possible to loathe someone so much, let alone find that loathing doubled. GAIA stares at a point past Aloy, clearly lost in memory. \"I watched the Faro machines consume the world. I saw how they refueled. They used nanites. They were rudimentary artificial intelligences who had spontaneously developed expanded cognition, who could utilize nanites, and who could override all but the most complex systems.\" She looks back to Aloy. \"Do you see the connection?\" \"The sub-functions,\" Aloy whispers. \"APOLLO sent that signal,\" GAIA says again. \"Both versions of APOLLO were constructed using a Far Zenith database as a foundation. And APOLLO returned from Far Zenith's possession\u00a0demonstrating\u00a0the abilities of the Faro machines. We can easily surmise who installed the original glitch.\" Aloy had already suspected that Ted Faro had been a member of Far Zenith. She tastes\u00a0something bitter in the back of her throat",

It reveals crucial information about the origins of the Faro machines' glitch and the potential involvement of Far Zenith and APOLLO in the events that led to the world's destruction.\n\nKey points from this page:\n\n1. Aloy and GAIA discuss the implications of APOLLO's survival and its apparent hatred for humans, which led to it encouraging HEPHAESTUS to turn against humanity.\n2. GAIA suspects that APOLLO sent the signal that awakened her subordinate functions, who mirror APOLLO's abilities and are composed of nanites, allowing them a degree of mobility and the ability to exist outside of hardware.\n3. GAIA reveals that Elisabet had confided in her about the true cause of the Faro machines' glitch: a secret backdoor deliberately installed on Ted Faro's orders to seize control from clients and Faro Automated Solutions itself, which backfired and allowed the machines to gain control.\n4. Aloy expresses her gratitude for GAIA's presence and her ability to piece together the puzzle, acknowledging that she could not have figured it out on her own.\n5. GAIA draws parallels between the Faro machines' abilities, such as utilizing nanites and overriding complex systems, and the abilities demonstrated by the subordinate functions and APOLLO.\n6. GAIA suggests that APOLLO sent the signal that awakened the subordinate functions and that both versions of APOLLO were constructed using a Far Zenith database as a foundation.\n7. Aloy and GAIA conclude that Far Zenith was likely responsible for installing the original glitch in the Faro machines, and Aloy's suspicion that Ted Faro was a member of Far Zenith is reinforced.\n\nThe passage uncovers a web of connections between Far Zenith, Ted Faro, APOLLO, and the Faro machines' glitch, shedding light on the true origins of the catastrophe that befell the world. The revelation of Ted Faro's deliberate actions and the potential involvement of Far Zenith in the creation of the glitch adds a new layer of complexity to the story and raises questions about the motivations behind their actions. Aloy and GAIA's conversation also highlights the importance of their partnership in unraveling the mysteries and confronting the challenges that lie ahead.\n\nPlease let me know if you have any further questions or if there's anything else I can assist you with!",

Clearly, they overshot on both counts and destroyed themselves.\" Aloy doesn't think she's imagining the satisfaction that threads through GAIA's voice for a fleeting moment. \"MINERVA informed me of the Titan core that you used to access the broadcast tower, retroactively enabled to communicate with the rootkit inside Zero Dawn. I must assume that it was modified by APOLLO.\" GAIA pauses, a tiny frown evident on her face. \"Mr. Faro never did admit how he had the glitch installed. Elisabet did not trust him, but a certain amount of leeway given to him due to his funding was inevitable. Elisabet knew it was a risk, but the greater risk was wasting time trying to gather funds from other sources. Few would have believed in the possibility of Zero Dawn's success, and Elisabet only had one extraordinarily wealthy person to blackmail.\" GAIA pauses again, as if weighing all that she has said. \"I believe\u00a0Far Zenith installed secret access in Zero Dawn in the same way they installed secret access in Mr. Faro's robots. Something within its very blueprint.\" \"Why?\" Aloy bursts out. \"Were they going to sabotage it? Did they _want_ the world to die?\" GAIA shakes her head. \"I do not know. But I do not think they wanted that. They would not have been able to\u00a0profit off of a dead world. I believe all of this was a progression of deeply unfortunate mistakes.\" Aloy's fingers tremble around the globe. She takes several steadying breaths, swallowing\u00a0her anger. \"APOLLO used that access\u00a0to awaken and alter the subordinate functions,\" GAIA says quietly. \"HADES then used a virus to sever them entirely from my control. The glitch was likely something similar. A virus that exploited Far Zenith's access, or something that evolved from whatever else they were attempting with the Chariot machines. Regardless, command and control was severed in the Faro machines because their security systems were altered, like the Alpha Registry, and there was no other way in. Brilliantly simple. We should count ourselves lucky that HADES's command of that ability was not particularly honed and that all Registry files were not corrupted.\" Aloy doesn't want to think about it. Fortunately or unfortunately, she's distracted by something else. \"HADES woke them up,\" she says, in her own realization, a sudden resolution\u00a0to a question that's lingered unanswered\u00a0for months. \"The Faro machines. Before I stopped him. He couldn't use the terraforming system, so he wanted to use the machines instead. He could control them.\" But not through activation codes, she thinks. \"He was using the\u00a0access.\" GAIA goes quiet again. \"You need to tell me everything, Aloy,\" she says at length. \"From the beginning.\"",

It concludes the conversation between Aloy and GAIA, tying together the various threads of the narrative and setting the stage for the challenges that lie ahead.\n\nKey points from this page:\n\n1. GAIA suggests that Far Zenith's technological capabilities enabled them to inadvertently cause the evolution of the Faro machines, ultimately leading to their own destruction.\n2. GAIA reveals that the Titan core used by Aloy to access the broadcast tower was likely modified by APOLLO, allowing it to communicate with the rootkit inside Zero Dawn.\n3. GAIA explains that Ted Faro never admitted how the glitch was installed and that Elisabet had to give him some leeway due to his funding of Zero Dawn, despite her distrust of him.\n4. GAIA believes that Far Zenith installed secret access in Zero Dawn, similar to the access they installed in the Faro machines, as part of its blueprint.\n5. Aloy questions Far Zenith's motives, and GAIA suggests that the events were likely a progression of deeply unfortunate mistakes rather than a deliberate attempt to destroy the world.\n6. GAIA explains that APOLLO used the secret access to awaken and alter the subordinate functions, while HADES used a virus to sever them from GAIA's control, exploiting the altered security systems and Alpha Registry.\n7. Aloy realizes that HADES had awakened the Faro machines before she stopped him, using the secret access to control them in place of the terraforming system.\n8. GAIA asks Aloy to tell her everything from the beginning, setting the stage for a more detailed account of the events that have transpired.\n\nThe passage brings together the various elements of the story, revealing the interconnected nature of the threats faced by Aloy and GAIA. The involvement of Far Zenith, Ted Faro, APOLLO, and HADES in the creation and exploitation of the vulnerabilities in Zero Dawn and the Faro machines paints a complex picture of the challenges that must be overcome. The conversation between Aloy and GAIA also showcases their growing partnership and the importance of their combined knowledge and abilities in confronting the dangers that lie ahead.

After the nonstop pace, it seems like every part of her hurts, but she doesn't let the strider slow. Behind her, tramplers roar, and a part of her not concerned with flight is thankful that she's only drawn the attention of more lumbering machines, who can't quite catch up with a determined strider. The non-responsive machines aren't like the ones before. They don't give up the chase after a while to return to their mechanical routines. Patterned after animal intelligence, HEPHAESTUS had said, with machine tenacity and tirelessness. A delightful mix. But Cauldron ZETA is close.

A little farther, to give the others as much time as possible.
