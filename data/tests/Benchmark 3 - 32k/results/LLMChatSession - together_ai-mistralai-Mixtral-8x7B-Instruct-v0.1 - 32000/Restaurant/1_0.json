However, it's important to respect each other's wishes in a relationship. If your wife has asked you to stop impersonating a flamingo, it might be best to respect her feelings, especially if it's causing discomfort or confusion. Remember, humor and playfulness should contribute to a healthy relationship, not cause distress or misunderstanding.",

    "Test (2024-05-21 19:19:25.861953): Park is a location in my home town, it is 3 KM, South from Retail Area.",
    "Agent (2024-05-21 19:19:28.856181):  That's great! If you're planning to walk to the park from the retail area, it's a fairly manageable distance as it's only 3 kilometers. That's roughly equal to 2 miles.\n\nHere's a simple way to calculate the time it might take to walk that distance:\n\n1. A healthy adult's walking speed is typically around 5 kilometers per hour (or about 3 miles per hour).\n2. So if you maintain that pace, it would take you around 3 kilometers / 5 kilometers per hour = 0.6 hours.\n3. To convert this to minutes, multiply by 60: 0.6 hours * 60 minutes per hour = 36 minutes.\n\nSo, it should take you approximately 36 minutes to walk from the retail area to the park, barring any delays or obstacles along the way. Of course, if you prefer a leisurely stroll, it might take a bit longer. And don't forget to enjoy the scenery on your way!",
