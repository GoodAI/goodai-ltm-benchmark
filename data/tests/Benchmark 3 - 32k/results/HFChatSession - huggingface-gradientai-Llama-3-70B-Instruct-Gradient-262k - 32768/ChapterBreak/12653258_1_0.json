    "Test (2024-05-20 13:26:33.264413): 1st page:\n\n\t1. Thoughts keep getting tangled in my head    This is a side of him that no one\u2019s ever seen. It\u2019s true for Taehyung too, but even more so for himself. It\u2019s not like he hasn\u2019t slept over friend\u2019s houses, or no one else has ever seen him sleeping before. But this. This is different. The light coming from the window is usually scarce, because Jungkook doesn\u2019t like waking up with the sun in his eyes, nor does Taehyung. However, the night before Taehyung had insisted that they should watch the stars together, because he\u2019s been studying them and he wanted to show everything he had learned to Jungkook as well. (Jungkook was studying them too, because he was really curious about things, especially things Taehyung was curious about, but he enjoyed to listen to Taehyung talk as if he was teaching him from scratch, his observations and words always beautiful and way more interesting than the ones Jungkook had read on the internet.) So, this time around, Taehyung\u2019s face is clear and bright under the morning light, the slope of his nose highlighted, each and every mole apparent, lips puffed and slightly parted, face squished against the pillow by Jungkook\u2019s side on Jungkook\u2019s bed. And Jungkook stares, because he\u2019s not fully awake just yet. He takes a while to wake up, always have, and therefore there\u2019s nothing to stop him from staring. Even blinking comes slow and lazily, and that has nothing to do with the fact he\u2019s a little hypnotized by the view. It\u2019s just how it is. How things are. How he is. Hopefully, how they are. It\u2019s simply not a step he\u2019s willing to take. Not right now. A step bigger than his legs are, that\u2019s what it feels like. He wants to reach for it, oh, Jungkook does. But that might scare Taehyung away. Taehyung isn\u2019t ready for that just yet. And that\u2019s really fine. Just, moments like this, under the rising sun, on his bed, by Taehyung\u2019s side, this feels all too different. Too beautiful, too good, too much. His chest aches, then, for something. A warmth. Someone. A proximity lacking, and he needs it then, as if his life depends on it, his chest is pulling Taehyung to him, begging, screaming, heart threatening to burst through if Jungkook doesn\u2019t do something, anything. Maybe it works, and the thing inside his chest is so strong that it manages to make Taehyung stir in his sleep, and literally roll to Jungkook\u2019s side. Or it\u2019s just Taehyung, being Taehyung, and squishing his face into Jungkook\u2019s chest is just way better than any pillow could ever be. He sighs in contentment, sinking further into Jungkook\u2019s aching chest, and in a moment it\u2019s like there was never any pain there, to begin with. I must be going crazy, is what Jungkook thinks, breathing through his nose as slowly and quietly as he can. \u201c\u2018Mmnornin, Koo.\u201d  A heartbeat\u2014one Taehyung certainly hears, left ear pressed against Jungkook\u2019s heart\u2014and a soft smile on Jungkook\u2019s lips as he replies, voice hoarse from sleep:  \u201cGood morning, Taetae.\u201d  And Jungkook is glad he gets to wake up like this a bunch of days. Because this. This is special. On other days he wakes up with a punch to the stomach, yeah, sometimes even with a pair of feet resting way too close to his face, but still. Still, this isn\u2019t something he\u2019d ever trade. \t2. Chapter 2  The bad thing about sleeping with Jungkook is the one thing that shouldn\u2019t be bad at all about sleeping. Only, it\u2019s 7h10 and Taehyung really needs to wake up, really needs to get ready to work, really needs to _get out of bed._  But capitalism. As Yoongi said, capitalism ruined the simplest, most beautiful thing ever. Sleep",

    "Test (2024-05-20 13:26:34.082636): 2nd page:\n\nSomething to make Taehyung sleep like a rock, and wake up like he just had the best night of rest in years, but also like he could keep on sleeping like that forever. _Drugs._ That should be it. Because it _is_ addicting. Once he found his way into Jungkook\u2019s bed, it was really hard to resist the urge of inviting himself in every night. He only did it for the sake of Jungkook not getting tired of him, and throwing him out of their shared apartment. \u201cKoo, we gotta wake up now.\u201d  Jungkook mumbles this time, maybe they took a ten minutes nap from the moment they exchanged good mornings. It happens frequently. Taehyung pokes his ribs, rather carefully, but the location guarantees an immediate reaction. The body under him moved, and Taehyung looks up to find an angry look pointed down at his face. \u201cMust you hurt me in order to wake me up, Taehyung?\u201d  \u201cYeah. Otherwise, you never do, not as fast as we need you to, at least. Plus, that didn\u2019t really hurt, you\u2019re just being a baby.\u201d  \u201cIt hurt. I\u2019m very sensitive when I wake up.\u201d  Taehyung almost beams at the slip-up, his day already made when his lips part and he pronounces very attentively:  \u201cOh?\u201d  Jungkook is torn between blushing and grunting, and that gets a pillow smashed into Taehyung\u2019s face. \u201cWhy are you like this?\u201d He rolls out of bed, maybe suppressing his laughter. Taehyung giggles, getting up too. \u201cThis is an important piece of information, Koo, I can tell your future girlfriend about it, and that\u2019s gonna be good for you later.\u201d  He winks, and Jungkook visibly rolls his eyes. \u201cYeah, and she wouldn\u2019t find it suspicious at all that you somehow seem to have this important piece of information.\u201d  Taehyung realizes\u00a0a lot of things at once, but the most important one is that Jungkook shouldn\u2019t get a girlfriend anytime soon. That would mean the end of their nights sleeping together. He feels too selfish to actually say that out loud, so he moved to the bathroom instead, Jungkook\u2019s bathroom, and grabbed his toothbrush, his extra toothbrush that has been used more times than his actual toothbrush, almost forgotten at his own bathroom. Still, Jungkook is too attentive to let something like this pass by unnoticed, his eyes are careful on Taehyung and some of the hairs on his nape bristle as an effect. Jungkook walks to his side and grabs his own toothbrush. \u201cWhat?\u201d  Taehyung stops brushing. \u201cPromise me one thing.\u201d  \u201cHuh?\u201d  \u201cJust say you\u2019ll promise me one thing.\u201d  Jungkook looks down to his toothbrush as he puts on some toothpaste. \u201cThat\u2019s already a promise, Tae.\u201d  \u201cWhatever. Then promise twice.\u201d  Jungkook smiles, rather softly. \u201cYeah, okay.\u201d  \u201cHm. Good.\u201d Taehyung takes the toothbrush off his mouth, and lowers himself to spit on the sink. When he rises again, Jungkook is brushing his teeth, waiting only mildly curiously. \u201cThen promise we\u2019ll still do everything we do now even if we start dating someone.\u201d  His brain supplies an \u201celse\u201d that stays on Taehyung\u2019s mind only, echoing like a disturbing horror movie sound. He\u2019s got no idea why he thought that, but it\u2019s probably just a habit, from usually saying the words \u201csomeone else\u201d together. Jungkook nods within a heartbeat, and that\u2019s enough to appease Taehyung messy head. Then he looks surprised, as if he had just understood what Taehyung has said. Not what he _asked,_ but what was being said behind all that. He\u2019s smug the rest of that hellish day, as Taehyung leaves to his own bathroom to shower (not before Jungkook purposely gets toothpaste on his nose), as they prepare tea and eat before leaving, on the way to the bus stop, all the way to the subway station, Jungkook doesn\u2019t utter a word but his smile says everything",
    "Agent (2024-05-20 13:26:35.512485): What main character did Taehyung realize shouldn't get a girlfriend any time soon?",
    "Test (2024-05-20 13:26:35.516922): 3rd page:\n\nChapter 3  They met during college, both music students, Taehyung already a trainee at the Orchestra that Jungkook was applying for an internship. At some point, they started going to work together, then they were going to college together too, and sharing the touring road trips together, and suddenly they were\u2026 living under the same roof. It happened naturally. It was a better location, rent cheaper than they were paying before, because they could split the bills. It was only reasonable. And, well, the company was not unwelcome at all. Jungkook is a trainee now, recently graduated, so he usually arrives home first. Taehyung is a junior, and he\u2019s far from being a workaholic \u2014 that\u2019s easily a lot more like Jungkook \u2014 , but in between distractions he always comes home around eight p.m., while Jungkook is sometimes free even before six. Their roles on the Orchestra had nothing to do with their work titles \u2014 that was more salary and work hours related. Whereas Jungkook was a pianist, Taehyung played the cello. Neither of them were soloists yet, but their Orchestra was a little different than the most formal ones. This Thursday, however, Taehyung had promised to get home as soon as he could, so he could help Jungkook with the laundry. _ The laundry _ is a very specific procedure which Jungkook prefers to take care of himself. He had his own difficulties in the beginning, but by now he was quite the expert in washing machines. Well, at least with the washing machine that was  _ theirs. _  He never denied the company, however, and Taehyung could never stay still for too long, not even when he was lying down. \u201cGod, Tae, that was too much detergent.\u201d  \u201cThat\u2019s what you put the last time! I paid attention.\u201d  His forehead creases, lips pressed tightly together on a pout. \u201cYeah, and we found out that night that it was too much detergent! And we had a lot more clothes inside back then\u2026\u201d They were getting the hang of the whole house chores thing, the days where clothes would pile up until they were almost a living creature left way behind them. They exchange quizzical looks. Taehyung\u2019s smile is practically sly as he pushes the start button. \u201cWe\u2019ll have to wash it all twice. Mark my words.\u201d Jungkook sighs, defeated. \u201cWanna bet?\u201d  That makes him take a 180 degrees turn. \u201cWhat?\u201d  \u201cDinner. It\u2019s on me if you\u2019re right. You can choose.\u201d  \u201cWill we go out?\u201d  \u201cSure. Not too far, though, I know you\u2019re tired.\u201d  Jungkook shrugs. He is, and so must be Taehyung \u2014 it was a long week \u2014 , but they rarely ever go out to eat. \u201cDeal.\u201d  They deal with the first batch of clothes while the washing machine works, and soon the foam leaking out of the machinery\u2019s door is a good enough indicative that, yeah, Jungkook was right after all. Unfortunately, they only notice the foam the moment when Taehyung slips on it. It all happens in slow motion right in front of Jungkook\u2019s widened eyes. A jacket is thrown to the ceiling, Taehyung\u2019s arms reaching for any kind of support as he falls to his imminent death. Or so it looks like, which prompts Jungkook to react as fast and best as he can. That doesn\u2019t guarantee, however, that the results are anything different from the both of them falling down, weirdly tangled, but all the heads involved in the disaster are  _ safely  _ away from the floor and all the pointy corners surrounding them. \u201cOuch, my ass.\u201d  Jungkook breathes in a ridiculous amount of air. \u201cLeast it wasn\u2019t that thing attached to your neck which apparently you never use for anything at all.\u201d  \u201cHey! No need to get all aggressive on me now.\u201d  Jungkook grunts. \u201cMy back\u2026\u201d  Taehyung scrambles to get off of him, sitting up. \u201cDid you hit it somewhere? Are you hurt? I\u2013\u201d  \u201cNo",
    "Agent (2024-05-20 13:26:37.354624): What is the procedure for washing clothes that Jungkook takes care of himself?",
    "Test (2024-05-20 13:26:37.359177): 4th page:\n\n\u201cYeah. You?\u201d   Taehyung visibly relaxes, eyes closing as his lips shape into a signature boxy-smile. \u201cYeah, thanks to you! My hero.\u201d  \u201cDon\u2019t go quoting anime on me right now.\u201d  \u201cI\u2019m only quoting because you can recognize it, otherwise I\u2019d just be  _ saying _ it. It\u2019s a normal phrase, you weeb. People say that all the time.\u201d  \u201cThe frequency and the generalization are both highly debatable. Anyway, I win.\u201d  \u201cHuh?\u201d  \u201cThe bet. I want barbecue, by the way.\u201d  \u201cHuuh?\u201d Taehyung\u2019s face gets impossibly close, closer than it was when they were literally tangled. \u201cYou\u2019re really going for my savings here, Koo.\u201d  Jungkook laughs, which grants him foam at his right cheek. Foam he never saw coming because he had a serious case of Taehyung tunnel-vision. But even after a battle with the detergent\u2019s foam\u2014there are no winners, both of them sticky and dirty \u2014 , and the shower they have to take while the washing machine works for the second time, Taehyung never mentions it again. \u201cHey, we don\u2019t really have to\u2026\u201d  \u201cShh, I was just playing with you. Barbecue is great, actually. That\u2019s what money\u2019s for, right?\u201d  Taehyung\u2019s face disappears behind a floral shirt, and they resume hanging out the clothes. \u201cEating?\u201d  The shirt wavers as he hears a chuckle. \u201cThat, too.\u201d  _ And what else? _  Jungkook waits, but Taehyung never explains himself. \t4. Chapter 4  \u201cOh, I\u2019m sorry, I have plans for tonight already.\u201d  Jiwoo\u2019s smile doesn\u2019t waver, as kind and collected as it was a moment ago, when she offered an invitation to the pub nearby, along with at least half of their musicians. \u201cWhere are you going? Perhaps we can meet at some point\u2026 just to say hi? It\u2019s a group hangout, after all.\u201d  \u201cHahah, I don\u2019t think that will happen, no, my plans involve staying in.\u201d  \u201cReally? You could do that another time, though\u2026\u201d  Has he been avoiding hanging out with his coworkers that much? No, not really, they almost never did this kind of thing, maybe that\u2019s why Jiwoo was being so forceful. However, she wasn\u2019t being invasive. Her tone was respectful and inviting. \u201cDefinitely not, no, I promised Jungkook we would do a movie marathon and eat popcorn. He\u2019s never going to forgive me if I make him leave the house instead. To a pub.\u201d  He laughs, and Jiwoo nods, tilting her head. \u201cCute.\u201d  \u201cHm?\u201d Taehyung blinks, not sure if he got it right. _Cute?_  \u201cYour friendship is really cute, you must really care about him.\u201d  \u201cOf course I do! I care about all of my friends.\u201d  Even as he says it, Taehyung feels the lie on his tongue. It tastes weird, and kind of bitter, because it isn\u2019t a lie. He\u00a0 _is_ a good friend, always has been, and he\u2019s got a pretty chunky list of people who could vow to that. But\u2026 it\u2019s a lot more than his responsibility as a friend, here. And of course, of course it is, Jungkook is a very dear friend with whom Taehyung really enjoys to spend time with. So why the hell would he cancel on Jungkook, if he actually had been waiting for their night in the whole week? He never voices that, parting ways a little awkwardly. It\u2019s like Jiwoo is waiting for something he\u2019s got no idea _what_ might be. Luckily, he doesn\u2019t dwell too long on it. Taehyung goes to the nearest market and buys ice cream too, mint chocolate flavored because it's Jungkook's favorite, and soon enough he is home. No one questioning him, only popcorn and a movie night with Jungkook ahead of him. Who would even dare to prefer a pub to this? Everything\u2019s already arranged, even if Jungkook isn\u2019t on sight",
    "Agent (2024-05-20 13:26:39.198209): Why did Taehyung feel like he was being questioned by Jiwoo?",
    "Test (2024-05-20 13:26:39.202622): 5th page:\n\n\u201cTae?\u201dJungkook\u2019s voice comes from the kitchen, at Taehyung\u2019s left. He puts his shoes away before answering. \u201cYep.\u201d  \u201cGo shower, I\u2019m cooking lamen.\u201d  \u201cCooking, right,\u201d Taehyung teases, entering the small kitchen and going for the freezer. Jungkook stops midway what would possibly be a complain the second he sees what Taehyung is doing. \u201cIce cream? Is it ice cream?\u201d  Taehyung shrugs, hiding the package as best as he can as he stores it inside the refrigerator. \u201cIt\u2019s a surprise.\u201d  The faintest smile passes through Jungkook\u2019s frame before he fakes annoyance, furrowing his eyebrows and frowning. Taehyung sprints to his bathroom, taking the quickest shower of his entire life and rushing back to the cozy living room, where he finds Jungkook this time around, sitting surrounded by the pillows, and starring the lamen cups with big, hungry eyes. \u201cOnly four?\u201d  He points to the floor beside him, where another four lamen cups remain closed, next to a thermal jug which is probably filled with hot water. Of _course_ there was more. Taehyung sits by Jungkook\u2019s side and they start their marathon, burning their tongues and crying from the extra spice of the lamens, emptying a few water bottles before finishing six of the eight cups. It\u2019s comfortable between them, intimacy coming naturally with gentle and tender touches, even when Jungkook pokes his ribs, or Taehyung flicks his earlobe, this is even more comfortable than the nest made of pillows and blankets on the floor. There isn't much space left for the popcorn after that, but they manage. And desserts get a whole other stomach for them, Jungkook's eyes shining so brightly it almost blinds Taehyung in the darkness of their home. They eat from the pot, and Jungkook almost gets a brain freeze, saved by Taehyung physically pulling it away from his grip. The movies are dumb, zombie comedies, and they manage to get to the third one before Jungkook starts to doze off, head falling on Taehyung\u2019s shoulder. Still, he struggles against the sleep, refusing to go to bed and pretending to be awake every time Taehyung says something. He can\u2019t help but smile fondly, and discreetly try to make their position more adequate for Jungkook to sleep. They have two beds, and a perfectly good sofa, but every once in a while sleeping on the living room floor isn\u2019t that bad, either. \t5. Chapter 5  He only ever heads back home by himself if there\u2019s something waiting for him to do that can\u2019t be dealt with later. Most times, there\u2019s a lot he can do near work: groceries, bookstores, malls. The possibilities are endless, and time waiting for Taehyung is too scarce for him to even notice. Soon enough his phone chimes and it certainly is Taehyung asking if he\u2019s still around. Sometimes he heads home first, even cooks a little something for dinner\u2014Taehyung always praises his food, and Jungkook thinks he\u2019s just talking his ears off because he wants Jungkook to cook more. Either way, he can\u2019t deny that it works a _little._ And he himself thinks his food isn\u2019t half as bad as it could be. But one thing rarely changes, even during the weekends. It\u2019s almost as if Taehyung _puts him to bed._  Not literally, Jungkook isn\u2019t a kid anymore, but he is kind of an insomniac. Taehyung has his own moments, too, but Jungkook is really worse. He forgets to sleep, he doesn\u2019t notice the time passing by, and he\u2019s awful at dealing with his own insomnia. The biggest proof of that is: He has some sick playlists to help him sleep, but does he remember to use them? So the first thing that happens is: Taehyung brews him some tea. And Taehyung takes that pretty seriously\u2014he\u2019s studied all kinds of plants and herbs after the best teas he could make to help Jungkook. They are ridiculously good, too, and how Taehyung manages this is out of his comprehension",

    "Test (2024-05-20 13:26:41.262544): 6th page:\n\nHe talks about trivial things, voice serene and low, lulls Jungkook\u2019s brain into a false state of peacefulness. He\u2019s always liked Taehyung\u2019s voice, that ain\u2019t something new. Listening to it to sleep has its disadvantages\u2014that\u2019s how the dreams started\u2014, but are they really disadvantages? When the tea ends, Taehyung drags Jungkook to bed and keeps talking his ears off. Jungkook talks back, too, some times more than others, but his tongue drags heavier inside his mouth. His own voice is deeper than usual, letting his tiredness show. The tea sure has an effect, his eyelids can barely hold up, and he _likes_ to hear Taehyung talk. Taehyung can be silent for long times, and Jungkook likes that, too, but Taehyung\u2019s voice seems to make his heart overflow. Sadly, it\u2019s not always that Taehyung stays. For some reason Jungkook can\u2019t understand, he has to go to his own bed. He considers disposing of Taehyung\u2019s bed a few times, but then he would have to give up the times Taehyung invited him to his bed instead of joining in Jungkook\u2019s one, and he wasn\u2019t ready for that yet. It was nice and different when they watched a drama or anime in _Taehyung\u2019s_ bed. And Taehyung _invited_ him to stay. Jungkook liked sleeping in Taehyung\u2019s bed too, and for that to keep happening Taehyung had to have his own bed. Unfortunately. Watching anime before bed is a big no\u2014they both get way too excited, and end up sleeping way past one in the morning. That, sometimes, happens. But not much. Taehyung takes sleeping seriously, for his sake. Which is why most of the times he leaves Jungkook\u2019s bed when he thinks Jungkook is already asleep, Jungkook won\u2019t say anything. Most times, however, aren\u2019t tonight. On some rare occasions such as now, Jungkook reaches his left hand, towards Taehyung\u2019s wrist, and grabs it gently. \u201cYou\u2019re still awake?\u201d Taehyung whispers, surprised. They barely slept that Saturday, waking up to sunlight on their faces because the living room windows are big and the curtains translucent. The movie marathon the night before had Jungkook sleeping on the floor, he just didn\u2019t want it to end. \u201cBarely,\u201d he answers, not even opening his eyes. Taehyung waits in silence for a moment, then asks: \u201cYou want something?\u201d   _Stay,_ Jungkook thinks. _You don\u2019t have to go._  \u201cNah,\u201d he answers instead, suddenly way more nervous than he should be. What was he thinking? Why did he reach for Taehyung when Taehyung clearly wanted to leave? \u201c... Then?\u201d  Jungkook loosens the grip on Taehyung\u2019s wrist, pulling back. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing. Sorry.\u201d  Silence befalls the room, Taehyung isn\u2019t moving and Jungkook is definitely getting more anxious by the second. He opens his eyes at the same time Taehyung lays down again. \u201cI\u2019m staying. My job here isn\u2019t done yet.\u201d  Jungkook chuckles, closing his eyes again in a dumb attempt at hiding his embarrassment. \u201cThat\u2019s not your _job_.\u201d  \u201cHmph. Who said that?\u201d He can hear Taehyung moving closer, until his body is wrapping around Jungkook\u2019s waist, pressing his face against Taehyung\u2019s chest. \u201cThey\u2019re right, but only because I\u2019m doing this because I want to. Now, let\u2019s go to sleep, Koo. Good night.\u201d  Jungkook lets out a breath he didn\u2019t know he was holding. \u201cNight.\u201d  It\u2019s a little strangled, but Taehyung tightens the embrace and runs his fingers through Jungkook\u2019s hair, and soon enough he\u2019s not conscious enough to be nervous about anything at all. \t6",

    "Test (2024-05-20 13:26:43.451855): 7th page:\n\nThat\u2019s not a problem. Taehyung loves grocery shopping. Jungkook spaces out through most of it, dutifully pushing the shopping cart, even though he enjoys the food bits. And there are always food bits, no matter how many times they hit the market. \u201cDetergent _again_?\u201d Jungkook asks, startled to see it inside their cart. \u201cYes? Have you seen the number of dishes we make?\u201d  \u201cHave you seen the amount of _laundry_ we make? And we\u2019re not buying detergent for _that_ again.\u201d  Taehyung shakes his head, chuckling. \u201cOh, honey, that\u2019s not how this works.\u201d  Jungkook\u2019s face heats up instantly, and he focuses on hiding it instead of arguing. Taehyung must be right, he\u2019s the one who can\u2019t see a single spoon on the kitchen sink before he\u2019s doing the dishes again. A worker nearby drops one of the cans she\u2019s piling up on the bottom shelf, attracting both their eyes for a second. \u201cAnyway, last time we bought this was just a test, sometimes I\u2019m allergic to detergents. This one is good, though, and it\u2019s cheaper too, so we\u2019re buying more.\u201d  Jungkook shrugs. \u201cFair enough.\u201d  \u201cWhat else is on the list?\u201d  \u201cCereals. And eggs.\u201d  \u201cOh, this way then!\u201d  They stop when there\u2019s enough to fill four\u2014ecological\u2014bags, heading to the single counter and waiting for the cashier to come. It\u2019s a small market, a little farther from their apartment building than other markets, but Taehyung likes to support local businesses such as this one. And so does Jungkook, who also appreciates the extras they get whenever the owners are around, and the homemade treats they always have. \u201cLook, Tae, homemade melonpan!\u201d  Taehyung eyes it with curiosity. Their melonpan is his favorite. \u201cIs it fresh?\u201d  Before Jungkook can check the date, the same worker from before answers, assuming the cashier\u2019s place. \u201cYes! They were baked today.\u201d  \u201cCan we buy them? Can we, Tae?\u201d  Jungkook\u2019s eyes sparkle, as if Taehyung was ever going to deny him and he needed to resort to such a low trick. \u201cSure, you big baby.\u201d  The woman chuckles as Jungkook gets them _four_ packages, and Taehyung flicks his earlobe and messes with his hair, almost annoyed with his cuteness. \u201cHow long have you two been together, if you don\u2019t mind me asking?\u201d  Taehyung\u2019s smile fades into confusion as he stops looking at Jungkook and turns to the cashier. \u201cUh?\u201d It\u2019s Jungkook who asks, though, eyes big and curious. The cashier fumbles with the groceries, visibly flustered. \u201cUm, you two live together, right?\u201d  \u201cYeah, but\u2026\u201d  Taehyung interrupts him, throwing his arm around Jungkook\u2019s shoulders. \u201cAlmost two years, ain\u2019t it, Koo?\u201d  \u201cHuh? Tae, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s what-\u201d  Taehyung nods, turning back to her. \u201cAlmost two years now!\u201d  The woman nods, smiling shyly. \u201cYou\u2026 both seem really happy, that\u2019s all. Sorry if I stepped out of line...\u201d  \u201cNot at all! We don\u2019t really keep track of time because it\u2019s just so effortless. Time passes too fast. I am happy. Aren\u2019t you, Koo?\u201d  Jungkook nods, albeit visibly stunned. The cashier finishes helping them with their groceries, and as soon as they step out of the market, Jungkook says, very slowly:  \u201cI have no idea what just happened.\u201d  Taehyung laughs, nerves hidden by how loud he allows himself to be now that they\u2019re out in the open. \u201cMr. and Ms",
    "Agent (2024-05-20 13:26:45.751981): Why does Taehyung prefer shopping at local markets?",
    "Test (2024-05-20 13:26:45.756104): 8th page:\n\nThe night is a bit chilly, after all. \t7. Chapter 7  \u201cI\u2019d rather die.\u201d  \u201cLovely. We still promised Hoseok we would go. Even _Min Yoongi_ is going.\u201d  \u201cThat I\u2019ll have to see with my own two eyes to believe it.\u201d  \u201cThen _wake up,_ Taehyung.\u201d  Jungkook pushes him for real this time, and Taehyung almost falls off the bed. This is why he\u2019s usually the first one to wake up, and not the other way around. As he huffs and grumbles in surprise, all Jungkook does is _laugh._  _So inconsiderate._  \u201cI was almost there!\u201d  \u201cYou\u2019ve been almost there for the past thirty minutes. Breakfast is ready, you have five minutes to get ready and move your ass to the kitchen.\u201d  \u201cHarsh.\u201d  In truth, it\u2019s really hard to wake up and get ready fast when the perspective of running a marathon is the only thing on his horizon. On a Sunday, above all. Taehyung isn\u2019t the biggest fan of running, that\u2019s all. Goddamn Hoseok and all his voluntary work. No, scratch that. Voluntary work was great, overall, but why did it have to involve _running_ of all things? \u201cHe\u00a0has to stop trying to impress Namjoon,\u201d he declares as soon as he steps in the kitchen, where Jungkook waits, playing some game on his smartphone. \u201cHm? Isn\u2019t Joon and Jimin a thing?\u201d  \u201cWhat? !\u201d  \u201cYeah, I thought everyone knew?\u201d  \u201cHow did _you_ find that out?\u201d  \u201c... Anyway, Yoongi is the one trying to impress someone.\u201d  \u201c _What_?\u201d  Jungkook laughs, pretending to be too busy with his game to reply as Taehyung eats his cereal. Is everyone on their orchestra group of friends dating or _interested_ in dating someone? That\u2019s just absurd. Yeah, they\u2019re all pretty cute, yes, but dating? A relationship? It just sounds\u2026 No, Taehyung can\u2019t see that. _Wait._ But what about Jungkook? \u201cSo\u2026\u201d He starts, instantly earning a glare from Jungkook. In turn, he apparently dies in the game he was playing, so Taehyung gets more than two seconds of his attention. \u201cHave _you_ got your eyes on anyone?\u201d  Jungkook coughs like he\u2019s choked on something, perhaps air. \u201cWhat?\u201d  \u201cEveryone\u2019s dating or something, apparently. I thought you might\u2019ve been, too?\u201d  \u201cNo. _No,_ \u201d Jungkook repeats, with extra emphasis. \u201cNot dating?\u201d  \u201cNo.\u201d  \u201cNot even any crushes?\u201d  \u201cWe should get going.\u201d  \u201cOh?\u201d He looks down at his bowl, finding it still half-full. \u201cBut I\u2019m not finished. Koo-\u201d  He drinks it in a hurry, praying it won\u2019t be too bad for his stomach, and rushes to the front door where Jungkook awaits still looking flustered. Or mad, because they\u2019re late? Or both. The marathon isn\u2019t too far, but they need to catch a bus first. Still, they\u2019re pretty on time\u2014Hoseok compliments their punctuality and Taehyung raises an eyebrow at Jungkook, who simply ignores him. It\u2019s not as bad as it seemed to be now that they\u2019re here. It\u2019s a nice day, not cold but not hot either, and of Taehyung manages to take it easy, he\u2019s positive he can reach the finish line. He does the stretching carefully, with Jungkook\u2019s help. Jungkook is probably ending the marathon in first place, the way he\u2019s always exercising around the apartment and going out for night or morning runs at ass o\u2019clock. He even looks like a natural, like he\u2019s a part of this environment instead of one of the people brought by a friend. He goes around helping everyone he can, morning sunlight hitting the most prominent features of his face and catching Taehyung\u2019s eyes. Taehyung squints, but doesn\u2019t look away",

    "Test (2024-05-20 13:26:48.317231): 9th page:\n\nJungkook is sitting at the sidewalk by his side, smiling from ear to ear like he\u2019s not anywhere close to imminent death. \u201cMy legs were burning, Jungkook. _Burning._ And I\u2019m not exaggerating.\u201d  His hair is dripping sweat, and it shouldn\u2019t be _cute_ , but it\u2019s Jungkook. \u201cBut you did it! Imagine if you had some practice.\u201d  Taehyung lets out a weak snarl, lacking any bite to it. \u201cI\u2019d rather just keep watching you doing your routines around the house, thanks.\u201d  If Jungkook blushes, it\u2019s well hidden by the exercising blush that\u2019s still there. \u201cC\u2019mon, Tae. It was way better running along with you than it is running by myself every day. I\u2019ll keep up with you, and we don\u2019t have to go every day. _Please._ \u201d  That\u2019s true. Jungkook had kept his pace throughout the whole marathon, and that was probably why Taehyung had actually crossed the finish line. It was just impossible to resist Jungkook\u2019s puppy eyes. It was a trap all along, and Taehyung should have known it. \u201cFine.\u201d  Jungkook\u2019s face lights up instantly, and Taehyung almost feels good with himself for being the cause for his euphoria. A blond drops by Jungkook\u2019s side at the crosswalk, offering Taehyung a cold water bottle. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t even that hard.\u201d  And, truly, he\u2019s barely breaking any sweat. In fact, Yoongi looks almost _exactly_ like he did right before the marathon. Jungkook only chuckles by his side, and something clicks inside Taehyung\u2019s head. \u201cBastard. You called a taxi, didn\u2019t you?\u201d  Yoongi feigns innocence and utter bafflement. \u201cI would _never_ think of something like that.\u201d \t8. Chapter 8  The one thing Jungkook always tried to avoid was a matter of principle. Borrowing clothes from Taehyung was completely out of line. Because he had feelings Taehyung wasn\u2019t aware of, and he could never wear even a t-shirt from Taehyung without feeling stupidly giddy about it. This self-imposed rule only made him really good at having a tight schedule for their laundries. However. The weather was something Jungkook couldn\u2019t control just yet, and walking around the apartment without a t-shirt? That is fine. Going out in the cold weather without a hoodie? Well, that\u2019s just not as fine. Luckily, Jungkook wouldn\u2019t have to leave the house before his hoodies were all dry and ready to go, because it was still Sunday. \u201cOkay, we have like\u2026 six clothing items, together.\u201d Taehyung states, scientifically. \u201cI\u2019ll just stay under the blankets the whole day.\u201d  Taehyung chuckles, leaning into him. It makes everything inside Jungkook lights up, but he does his best to remain still. \u201cDon\u2019t be dumb, you should wear this.\u201d   And maybe it\u2019s because the specific item of clothing is so unexpected that Jungkook\u2019s brain comes to a halt, but he can\u2019t deny it. He ends up promptly accepting the pastel yellow crop top (crop top???) with long sleeves and then it\u2019s too late to deny it. Taehyung is happily singsonging to his favorite song (at the moment) and waltzing away from the laundry room, and Jungkook tries the crop top on  _ just because. _ It has their laundry\u2019s smell, after all, it shouldn\u2019t be that dangerous. \u2026 Except for the fact that he can\u2019t stop imagining Taehyung wearing this exact piece of clothing. When? In which context? Why hadn\u2019t Jungkook heard  _ anything  _ about this? They literally _ lived together. _  He can t deny the clothing item is fairly comfortable, and wearing nothing isn\u2019t exactly appalling when it\u2019s almost snowing outside. Even when their heating system is working just fine",

When their group chat with\u00a0their friends from work decides to come back to life talking about dinner (? ), Taehyung jumps out of bed and runs to the laundry again, rummaging through their laundry, more clothes dry than before, and for some reason, Jungkook gets to wear his own clothes again, but Taehyung needs a hoodie. And all Taehyung\u2019s hoodies are either wet or dirty. So. \u201cMines are finally dry,\u201d Jungkoook offers, in exchange for the crop top offer earlier. \u201cLook, it was an unexpected change of weather, we couldn\u2019t have known,\u201d Taehyung says, already wearing Jungkook\u2019s jacket, not sure about what he\u2019s even accepting, only worried about not catching a cold. \u201cYeah,\u201d Jungkook agrees, reluctantly. But there\u2019s not much he can do. His selfish feelings have absolutely nothing to do with this. \u2b52\u2b51\u2b52\u2b51\u2b52  Namjoon saw them getting in the restaurant and gasps when he sees what Taehyung is wearing because there, at Taehyung\u2019s back, is Jungkook\u2019s name. Printed on fabric. Everyone is shellshocked, and then Seokjin says, \u201cCongrats on the relationship update! !\u201d  Jungkook looked confused and even more so Taehyung, even from afar, but their friends were just happy. They come to their table and greet everyone, Jungkook getting redder by the second. \u201cFucking finally,\u201d Jimin says, making space for them right by his side. \u201cWe can order now.\u201d  \u201cIt was about time,\u201d Hoseok says, winking Jungkook\u2019s way. Taehyung looks from Hoseok to Jungkook, and the later avoids him. \u201cTo order food?\u201d  \u201cYeah, sure,\u201d Hoseok winks again, and Taehyung looks like he\u2019s about to lose it. They choose a meal course to share, neither of them super hungry but both wanting extra fries, and even though that\u2019s usual, every single person on their table sighs, calling them disgusting,  _ of fucking course they\u2019re gonna share. _ And that\u2019s when Taehyung loses it. He stands up, shouting \u201cRestroom!\u201d and dragging Jungkook along with him. \u201cWhy does everyone seem to think that we\u2019re dating now?\u201d  Jungkook hides further inside his hoodie. \u201cIt\u2019s the jacket. The one I lent you.\u201d  \u201cWhat about it? I mean, what if they know it\u2019s yours, what does it have to do with\u2026\u201d  \u201cHmm, it\u2019s my university\u2019s varsity jacket.\u201d  Taehyung looks right into his eyes, in complete silence. \u201cOh.\u201d  \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I just- you needed something, and it was dry, and-\u201d  \u201cYou let me borrow your varsity jacket!

I need a mirror, might snap some pics since we\u2019re here, I\u2019m wearing your varsity fucking jacket oh my god-\u201d  Jungkook is caught between dying and punching Taehyung, so he obviously only groans instead. \u201cTaehyung\u2026\u201d  \u201cYeah, join the photo, come here!\u201d  He ceases resisting Taehyung\u2019s shenanigans and just enjoys the moment.

Something changes right there and then, and Jungkook mentally sighs. This is why there was a rule, and he should have never borrowed any piece of clothing from Taehyung.

Someone said Jungkook didn't like kisses, neither giving or receiving them, and Taehyung scoffed and said Jungkook also didn't happen to like hugs, and **still** , Taehyung could hug him whenever he felt like it. \"So kiss him, then.\" Jimin provoked. Taehyung did. On Jungkook's right cheek, for whole three seconds and a half. Yes, Jungkook did count. He couldn't breathe for the whole thing, but right after it he put his tongue out for his friends, walking away as Taehyung puffed his chest looking very proud of himself. Jungkook laughed when he was at a safe distance, thinking of Taehyung showing off like a peacock for being allowed to kiss Jungkook's cheek. He was so dumb. And _endearing._  That's why he could get away with everything, although back then Jungkook wasn't aware of that. Not fully. Jimin looked quite full of himself, later. He had no idea why.",
    "Agent (2024-05-20 13:28:19.351763): Option 2:\n\n  It was during their choir days at college, maybe even before the Orchestra, that Taehyung first started to invite Jungkook to his family's place for meals. \"My mum puts too much food on the table,\" he said in a half-hearted attempt at chuckling, \"I just can't eat that much myself, and she'll be happier if there's someone new to feed.\"\n\n  And, indeed, Taehyung's mum failed miserably in her spyng attempts that first time Jungkook visited. She'd made more than a simple intro question. She'd ask him about his parents' whereabouts, what his future prospects were\u2014literally, a detective trying to crack a hard shell, never getting she was too obvious. Too much so. Jungkook had, politely but professionally, always sent her questions back where they'd come from.\n\n  Taehyung was mortified. It wasn't as if Jungkook was a undeserving guest, on any terms. Either if it was character or music, actually, everyone liked Jungkook. The way he was never ready to brag about being a genius pianist\u2014but had an incredibly rare gift, of course according to Taehyung's own opinion and the amount of people who'd gone for auditions and ended up being unable to meet the passing grades\u2014, or even the way he copied Taehyung's lead, his moral compass, and how he tried his best to follow his advice, it all appealed to Taehyung's mum's grumpy nature. But she wasn't right to investigate that way.\n\n  So he had to intervene, and that's where laying bare his feelings came into place. He sat her down, told her\u2014threatened her, maybe, he felt like\u2014they were friends, and that was it, he swore on his life that he was _not_ going anywhere with Jungkook, and Jungkook  _ hadn't done anything but to look at the back of Taehyung's head, ever. _ Ever!_\n\n  Taehyung couldn't keep his heart from speeding up when he spoke those words to his mum, told her  _ that. _ It was true, right? Jungkook hadn't even looked at him romantically. He'd tried to kiss him that time, he's sure he did, but only because he was drunk and probably thought it would be fun, and Jungkook simply wasn't interested. Probably.\n\n  Jungkook left as soon as he could. It was the first time he'd been in Taehyung's house, after all. Taehyung powered through a half-hearted dinner, went to his room and tons of theories came to his head. By the end of the night, he wasn't even sure if he'd been interested in Jungkook that way.\n\n  Taehyung's mum called him out on it a week later. \"You weren't being honest with me, son. I know it.\" She'd never called him \"son\" before.\n\n  Every time Jungkook visited after that he was always greeted with a smile and endless positives gossip about \"his friend\" that made Taehyung want to roll his eyes but he couldn't, for the fear of raising suspicions. He was sure Jungkook hadn't told anyone, he hadn't even told Taehyung that mom had called him a \"friend\", so, it should have been her personal observations... but still. His mum couldn't be trusted anymore when it came to Jungkook, so, what if something did happen and she figured it out again?\n\n  Taehyung had just introduced him as the guy he hung out with that day, \"actually, he's joining the orchestra, pretty cool!\"\u2014because Jungkook wasn't even part of the Choir. The full college Orchestra was his real goal, though. It didn't work. His mum knew Jungkook was in the Choir because she made Taehyung tell details. That's when she said it. _\"The piano guy is your friend?\"_\n\n  Taehyung told himself two things: one, he had to keep Jungkook away from home at all costs and, two... he had to lie, he had to lie so bad his mum would never even believe the word \"friend\" has anything to do with Jungkook in Taehyung's life. And he told her so, a heavy sigh, a crossed heart, a dear God, please never leave me alone with that desperate piano guy, that fool, that hopeless idiot. His mum could only laugh and tell him: _\"Well, you're in kinda deep, huh?\"_\n\n  Taehyung had that hot, clammy feeling he got when he knew he'd been caught out on something, but, he suddenly got it. _Mom's testing me._ She just guesses, she's just observing the facts and thinks, but she doesn't know, not without confirmation, and so Taehyung guessed even louder, told his mum a story of how he had a crush on  _the piano guy for the past five years [_\"more, actually, but no matter\"_ ] but, Jungkook wasn't receptive of his romantic affections. It was a truth Taehyung hadn't admitted to himself before then, and he surely didn't want to see his mum's reaction to it, but... he was a grown man now, after all, and he couldn't keep on going on this way admitting his feelings and expecting his mum not to notice, and he might not keep on going this way, actually. He could, Keep on going this way, and not call him anything but his \"friend\". But it wouldn't go on any longer, that was for sure.\n\n  So he told his mum. Taehyung confessed to his mum that he'd been in love with Jungkook for God knows how long, and, indeed, he kept going on. He couldn't help it, but his mum knew. Still, Jungkook couldn't go back to the house and he'd never have to know Taehyung had told his mum. And, that's exactly what he did\u2014kept going on for almost three years. Three years without inviting Jungkook to majority\u2014there's a few exceptions\u2014of his family dinners, but that sucked, and if he could live with that, he could live far much better with not revealing that he was in love with the person that had just joined the ritzy Orchestra.  And so he did.\n\n  Taehyung left the Choir before graduating, knowing he was bound for the Orchestra. He took the extra year to sort his feelings out. It was _okay,_ like this, at least, he wouldn't do something that would probably end with Taehyung not being able to treat Jungkook as a friend anymore, and the orchestra needed friends. Jungkook kept on going, to the Choir, to the Orchestra, his college auditions were never a _maybe,_ and, for once, Jungkook wouldn't have to work extra hard to get there. He was just... jungkook.  Taehyung left the Choir knowing he had to forget jungkook\u2014or die trying\u2014but he surprised himself being the nice initiate that he used to be, asking jungkook for help, abstaining from gifting him anything, and the times they talked or hung out, he was just being his regular self, never trying to be better than he was or promoting his own good qualities over jungkook's bad but, the less Taehyung spoke or thought about jungkook, the more he made the mistake of doing, maybe too often, and he couldn't break the orbit he was stuck in, ruled by this obsession he just couldn't forget him the way he'd wanted, he needed his distance.  As time went on, jungkook's influence reached every kind of corner jungkook's surname didn't. Taehyung decided to go back to college and finish choir, actually graduate with it, for once his passion had a significant pay, making him not need to go for any of the subjects he hated. He could do Music Theory and Voice lessons, there sure were some sad times where he couldn't live with that, but he managed to keep it up and he even made friends in his new class, no one had ever met jungkook, and Taehyung would gladly keep it that way. \n\n  Taehyung went at the end of each day to the parts of his college frequented by jungkook, hoping to see him, and he did. And, Jungkook looked happy, he always did, actually, and whenever jungkook noticed him watching, jungkook would smile, or raise a hand, even wait for Taehyung after choir practice some times so they could have dinner together. Taehyung could see him growing closer, confidant with the other students, especially the girls, or so Taehyung thinks. None of them looked like jungkook with their skinny legs and witless mouths, wekk, one or two of them looked hot, and jungkook obviously liked them, probably. _No, probably not, jungkook would never fall into something like that. Maybe he would. Who cares? I mean, he probably would, who wouldn't have a crush on jungkook? Yeah, I guess, who wouldn't? He looked good, always sharing lamen mazala with a girl in some igloo shop on the dead part of town. He\u2019d bring the same lamen with him for lunch, and he looked good. Very good, opening the door for her, sharing kisses, vanilla selfies and girls\u2019 kisses with them that jungkook was outside, not meant for jungkook to see at all, and",

While Jungkook\u2019s been dealing with his allergies throughout his whole life, Taehyung rarely ever gets sick. He\u2019s got iron immunity, superhero worthy, but every time Taehyung does get sick, it\u2019s official hospital visiting hours. Even his colds look like a new damn virus just got brought into the world. Maybe Jungkook is a little too impressionable, maybe he\u2019s worrying too much. However, as long as there\u2019s a probability he could be even remotely right, he\u2019s not going to change.

    "Test (2024-05-20 13:28:22.730840): Option 3:\n\n\t9. Should I talk to you or not? There\u2019s nothing that could bring two people together more than Family visits. When Jungkook\u2019s birthday is right around the corner and they will be on the road doing concerts during it, Taehyung knows what is coming. And there\u2019s no escape. It\u2019s not that they dislike their families \u2013 completely not their case, at all, but the timing. Always the timing. \u201cI\u2019m going to die,\u201d Jungkook states, and Taehyung knows it\u2019s not drama because he feels it too. He feels it, but he needs to be the stronger one this time, and so he says \u201cIt\u2019s a day off, we\u2019ve been working day and night in preparation for this, right? We deserve a little rest, too. And just before we hit the road, just in time! It\u2019s perfect.\u201d  Jungkook\u2019s eyes beg for mercy, and they both know what Taehyung said is true, but they both also know that their families coming over for an early birthday celebration isn\u2019t what _rest_ is.",
    "Agent (2024-05-20 13:29:35.021540): Option 4:\n\n    Perhaps he\u2019s just better at hiding them. Maybe Taehyung has just gotten too accustomed to Jungkook\u2019s habits, learned to pick out the things that were once hard to spot as well. But it doesn't matter. Because no matter what is saying it, whether it's a healthy habit, or a unhealthily familiar one, his body, his eyes, the scarce, and unexpected and so painfully missed softness of his voice during these last eight conceivably endless eight months... It all tells something so strong to Taehyung\u2019s heart, to his very core, triggers something that simply can't be ignored anymore, and every time they occur, no matter how tiny they are, Taehyung goes up another step in the slow ascent to the point of no return. Taehyung feels himself getting drawn to Jungkook again, as if his immunity had faded already since last time they slept alongside happily, back when everything was still unbearably okay. _\u201cNo, Taehyung, let\u2019s rest.\u201d_ Jungkook\u2019s voice echoes in Taehyung\u2019s head as an unbearable weight crushes his chest. They couldn\u2019t understand it before, the attraction they had for one another that was never on his mind\u2026 maybe Jungkook\u2019s at that time. But still, they\u2019ve opened Pandora\u2019s box, unknowingly, and now it\u2019s too late. Jungkook has a huge complex, not treating himself the way he thinks he should, something Taehyung hadn\u2019t realized during their close days but he knows now. This is just the surface of it, but now Taehyung knows for sure\u2014and feels it. Taehyung needs to go to the hotel rooms of their next tour stops, so the band doesn\u2019t get anxious about him being missing for no apparent reason. He\u2019s also training Jungkook for staying in their apartment, so\u2026 yeah, something has to happen.  Taehyung is a pretty good teacher, just by hanging out close and letting everyone go their routine at ease, sensible instincts rising from deep within, and Jungkook quickly gets used to it, to being around Taehyung all the time. Taehyung is almost relieved. It\u2019s closer to normal than he thought, but it\u2019s also spouting deep waters that should never, ever be crossed, staring at him dead in the eyes. Jungkook gets hungry, and they eat together. Jungkook is still taking up half of the laundry limit in order to not wait too much time for his equals, and Taehyung does that on most of their days off. Jungkook\u2019s playful side gets triggered, and he reaches for Taehyung playfully to poke at his ribs (not too hard, but just hard enough) and pull at his earlobe. Not that Taehyung hates it, either, even when they\u2019re off the drinking diet. It\u2019s not harassment, it\u2019s something Taehyung knows Jungkook will never realize is too intimate, something where he\u2019s not at fault... but sometimes, _sometimes_ Taehyung is  _so hard for it  _ that he has step out for air.  Taehyung\u2019s been denying his feelings for a long time, hiding inside the very same little details of himself which he let Jungkook see once upon a time.  Jungkook\u2019s body always curls into him, by accident or not, making Taehyung have to remind himself he\u2019s in no disposition for this, to pay attention to every little motion Taehyung\u2019s doing and be worried of bumping into an obviously touch-averted Jungkook. And so, when Jungkook tries to lay down where he usually does, on the bed, feet on the pillows and head on the headrest, and Taehyung says  _no._ Jungkook mutters something as \u201cI- Don\u2019t- Want- To,\u201d which takes a moment for Taehyung to decipher.  _Still using baby talk, Jungkookie. With a drunk puppy. You better settle for the floor, that\u2019s what you\u2019re looking for. This is TaeTae\u2019s place, have you forgotten of our pact? Once again, and all-out education awaits, you poor guy. I feel sorry, Jungkook. It\u2019s your own fault. \u201cTae! Asleep, in a minute! But Koo, for real, go to sleep where you sleep, I won\u2019t let another moment go to waste. I\u2019m still paying for that last time, and I can\u2019t do it again even if I wanted to. Trust me._ Jungkook said he was in a way, right? More like Jungkook should have been ashamed for taking advantage of Taehyung _and_ him, but no, Jungkook\u2019s shameless, you\u2019d have to take care of him forever. Yeah, and it did take time, patience, and a hell of a lot of conviction from Taehyung. But it paid off in the end. Jungkook is almost never this way when sober, and Taehyung has no idea how they let do this situation get out of hand, knowing how well it ended last time. It was never about holding grudges. Jungkook\u2019s drunken mistakes far surpassed Taehyung\u2019s. They can think over that this time, loudly. Steps our adult Jungkookie will regret giving, and another lesson he\u2019s about to learn.  Taehyung knew that if he kept it up with the un denting remarks, with the hand slaps and the pinching, with pressing his leg on Jungkook\u2019s, while keeping on a healthy and polite voice like that of his mum, then eventually Jungkook would probably get the idea. He hopes. He doubts Jungkook will get the idea that, as he told him before getting as drowsy as pumped he was, perhaps his drunken self is the uncareful, wild and useless version one should drop like a stone. Jungkook was clearly not the kind of person to drop someone who\u2019s coming to the realization he\u2019s in love with the person who\u2019s so very patient with the, in spite of how un-thought-of their actions are when they drink too much. That\u2019s why jungkook needed someone with a little bit more\u2026 will, at least, to make sure they don\u2019t slip up. Again. But\u2026 Jungkook was also the kind of person to freak, to shut that person out. To run from them, to have the rest of their friends toss this new person away, because Jungkook didn't want a crush on his relationships. _Or a new relationship. With a crush, specifically. Possibly._ Jungkook\u2019s usually not this drunk, especially in a safe environment such as the apartment training session, but there\u2019s been too much surrounded by alcohol in the last couple of concerts. It\u2019s made Jungkook put up with the idea.  As long as Taehyung doesn\u2019t cross his boundaries, Jungkook insists, slurred drunk. Taehyung agrees, of course. While this position is much more compromised than he\u2019s ever seen before, Jungkook is _aware_ that he is also  _drunk,_ and he let Taehyung near, and Taehyung wouldn\u2019t take it any further, further than this, where he could always easily coast and listen to whatever the drunken Jungkook has to say. He also won\u2019t lose his head and be fooled by Jungkook\u2019s alcohol-craving, so he definitely won\u2019t push him beyond what\u2019s acceptable, the way jungkook did to Taehyung last time. Jungkook doesn\u2019t drink like how he should, but Taehyung does. He stops drinking as soon as he can call it a night or when jungkook is wasted out of his mind, but saying  _no_ after having a sip never went well with his past. Better not start them in the first place, keep the next morning hangover free for chill brunch. There\u2019s a new doubt in Jungkook\u2019s mind now, but, he\u2019s too focused on trying to find a spot in the apartment where he can draw, specifically on the whiteboard, to let it settle. Trying to have both his feet on the ground makes him lose balance, so he lifts one and spins around to move backwards, fall on a chair instead, before trying to dip his brush in the ink pot again.  It\u2019s now that Taehyung notices some liquid on jungkook\u2019s fingertips, even before jungkook can dip the brush.  \u201cYour hand\u2019s bleeding,\u201d he says. Jungkook stops his movement, eyes surprised, jaw slack, and them slump, face getting meek. Taehyung gets a soapy rag and then gently cleans jungkook\u2019s finger, before pressing a band aid on it. Jungkook watches, unsure still, but not focusing too much on the pain, with a too attached look. Jungkook drops the brush to the floor, then presses his breasts to Taehyung\u2019s back, resting his face on his shoulder, and arms extending to slip around his waist. No hug in their adult years have been like, this is a vulnerable Jungkook, one Taehyung isn\u2019t familiar with. But jungkook isn\u2019t holding back, and whatever boundaries, whatever concerns Taehyung has, whatever fears he thinks jungkook has got... those literally mean nothing as jungkook oversteps all of them in a very official way. And in a ready and in fiery tantrums if Taehyung doesn\u2019t respect them or obey his unspoken desires. Taehyung tries to talk himself out of it? Well, jungkook will talk himself in, and it",

It's a good thing he was born on the last days of the year, that way his birthday always mixes up with New Year's Eve and he convinces everyone to do something else. Something nice, nothing like a birthday party, mind you. Jungkook used to keep tabs on special dates, for a good time, until he realized it was dumb and meaningless. Of course, if you were giving it meaning, then it meant something. But what he found out was that he, in fact, enjoyed a lot more spontaneous acts of affection.

They\u2019re not just two people sharing an apartment. Per se, they never were, because their friendship was great and they were each other\u2019s best friends.

It\u2019s true for Taehyung too, but even more so for himself. It\u2019s not like he hasn\u2019t slept over friend\u2019s houses, or no one else has ever seen him sleeping before. But this. This is different. The light coming from the window is usually scarce, because Jungkook doesn\u2019t like waking up with the sun in his eyes, nor does Taehyung. However, the night before Taehyung had insisted that they should watch the stars together, because he\u2019s been studying them and he wanted to show everything he had learned to Jungkook as well. (Jungkook was studying them too, because he was really curious about things, especially things Taehyung was curious about, but he enjoyed to listen to Taehyung talk as if he was teaching him from scratch, his observations and words always beautiful and way more interesting than the ones Jungkook had read on the internet.) So, this time around, Taehyung\u2019s face is clear and bright under the morning light, the slope of his nose highlighted, each and every mole apparent, lips puffed and slightly parted, face squished against the pillow by Jungkook\u2019s side on Jungkook\u2019s bed. And Jungkook stares, because he\u2019s not fully awake just yet. He takes a while to wake up, always have, and therefore there\u2019s nothing to stop him from staring. Even blinking comes slow and lazily, and that has nothing to do with the fact he\u2019s a little hypnotized by the view. It\u2019s just how it is. How things are. How he is. Hopefully, how they are. It\u2019s simply not a step he\u2019s willing to take. Not right now. A step bigger than his legs are, that\u2019s what it feels like. He wants to reach for it, oh, Jungkook does. But that might scare Taehyung away. Taehyung isn\u2019t ready for that just yet. And that\u2019s really fine. Just, moments like this, under the rising sun, on his bed, by Taehyung\u2019s side, this feels all too different. Too beautiful, too good, too much. His chest aches, then, for something. A warmth. Someone. A proximity lacking, and he needs it then, as if his life depends on it, his chest is pulling Taehyung to him, begging, screaming, heart threatening to burst through if Jungkook doesn\u2019t do something, anything. Maybe it works, and the thing inside his chest is so strong that it manages to make Taehyung stir in his sleep, and literally roll to Jungkook\u2019s side. Or it\u2019s just Taehyung, being Taehyung, and squishing his face into Jungkook\u2019s chest is just way better than any pillow could ever be. He sighs in contentment, sinking further into Jungkook\u2019s aching chest, and in a moment it\u2019s like there was never any pain there, to begin with. I must be going crazy, is what Jungkook thinks, breathing through his nose as slowly and quietly as he can. \u201c\u2018Mmnornin, Koo.\u201d  A heartbeat\u2014one Taehyung certainly hears, left ear pressed against Jungkook\u2019s heart\u2014and a soft smile on Jungkook\u2019s lips as he replies, voice hoarse from sleep:  \u201cGood morning, Taetae.\u201d  And Jungkook is glad he gets to wake up like this a bunch of days. Because this. This is special. On other days he wakes up with a punch to the stomach, yeah, sometimes even with a pair of feet resting way too close to his face, but still. Still, this isn\u2019t something he\u2019d ever trade. \t2. Chapter 2  The bad thing about sleeping with Jungkook is the one thing that shouldn\u2019t be bad at all about sleeping. Only, it\u2019s 7h10 and Taehyung really needs to wake up, really needs to get ready to work, really needs to _get out of bed._  But capitalism. As Yoongi said, capitalism ruined the simplest, most beautiful thing ever. Sleep",

Because it _is_ addicting. Once he found his way into Jungkook\u2019s bed, it was really hard to resist the urge of inviting himself in every night. He only did it for the sake of Jungkook not getting tired of him, and throwing him out of their shared apartment. \u201cKoo, we gotta wake up now.\u201d  Jungkook mumbles this time, maybe they took a ten minutes nap from the moment they exchanged good mornings. It happens frequently. Taehyung pokes his ribs, rather carefully, but the location guarantees an immediate reaction. The body under him moved, and Taehyung looks up to find an angry look pointed down at his face. \u201cMust you hurt me in order to wake me up, Taehyung?\u201d  \u201cYeah. Otherwise, you never do, not as fast as we need you to, at least. Plus, that didn\u2019t really hurt, you\u2019re just being a baby.\u201d  \u201cIt hurt. I\u2019m very sensitive when I wake up.\u201d  Taehyung almost beams at the slip-up, his day already made when his lips part and he pronounces very attentively:  \u201cOh?\u201d  Jungkook is torn between blushing and grunting, and that gets a pillow smashed into Taehyung\u2019s face. \u201cWhy are you like this?\u201d He rolls out of bed, maybe suppressing his laughter. Taehyung giggles, getting up too. \u201cThis is an important piece of information, Koo, I can tell your future girlfriend about it, and that\u2019s gonna be good for you later.\u201d  He winks, and Jungkook visibly rolls his eyes. \u201cYeah, and she wouldn\u2019t find it suspicious at all that you somehow seem to have this important piece of information.\u201d  Taehyung realizes\u00a0a lot of things at once, but the most important one is that Jungkook shouldn\u2019t get a girlfriend anytime soon. That would mean the end of their nights sleeping together. He feels too selfish to actually say that out loud, so he moved to the bathroom instead, Jungkook\u2019s bathroom, and grabbed his toothbrush, his extra toothbrush that has been used more times than his actual toothbrush, almost forgotten at his own bathroom. Still, Jungkook is too attentive to let something like this pass by unnoticed, his eyes are careful on Taehyung and some of the hairs on his nape bristle as an effect. Jungkook walks to his side and grabs his own toothbrush. \u201cWhat?\u201d  Taehyung stops brushing. \u201cPromise me one thing.\u201d  \u201cHuh?\u201d  \u201cJust say you\u2019ll promise me one thing.\u201d  Jungkook looks down to his toothbrush as he puts on some toothpaste. \u201cThat\u2019s already a promise, Tae.\u201d  \u201cWhatever. Then promise twice.\u201d  Jungkook smiles, rather softly. \u201cYeah, okay.\u201d  \u201cHm. Good.\u201d Taehyung takes the toothbrush off his mouth, and lowers himself to spit on the sink. When he rises again, Jungkook is brushing his teeth, waiting only mildly curiously. \u201cThen promise we\u2019ll still do everything we do now even if we start dating someone.\u201d  His brain supplies an \u201celse\u201d that stays on Taehyung\u2019s mind only, echoing like a disturbing horror movie sound. He\u2019s got no idea why he thought that, but it\u2019s probably just a habit, from usually saying the words \u201csomeone else\u201d together. Jungkook nods within a heartbeat, and that\u2019s enough to appease Taehyung messy head. Then he looks surprised, as if he had just understood what Taehyung has said. Not what he _asked,_ but what was being said behind all that. He\u2019s smug the rest of that hellish day, as Taehyung leaves to his own bathroom to shower (not before Jungkook purposely gets toothpaste on his nose), as they prepare tea and eat before leaving, on the way to the bus stop, all the way to the subway station, Jungkook doesn\u2019t utter a word but his smile says everything",

    "Test (2024-05-20 13:26:35.516922): 3rd page:\n\nChapter 3  They met during college, both music students, Taehyung already a trainee at the Orchestra that Jungkook was applying for an internship. At some point, they started going to work together, then they were going to college together too, and sharing the touring road trips together, and suddenly they were\u2026 living under the same roof. It happened naturally. It was a better location, rent cheaper than they were paying before, because they could split the bills. It was only reasonable. And, well, the company was not unwelcome at all. Jungkook is a trainee now, recently graduated, so he usually arrives home first. Taehyung is a junior, and he\u2019s far from being a workaholic \u2014 that\u2019s easily a lot more like Jungkook \u2014 , but in between distractions he always comes home around eight p.m., while Jungkook is sometimes free even before six. Their roles on the Orchestra had nothing to do with their work titles \u2014 that was more salary and work hours related. Whereas Jungkook was a pianist, Taehyung played the cello. Neither of them were soloists yet, but their Orchestra was a little different than the most formal ones. This Thursday, however, Taehyung had promised to get home as soon as he could, so he could help Jungkook with the laundry. _ The laundry _ is a very specific procedure which Jungkook prefers to take care of himself. He had his own difficulties in the beginning, but by now he was quite the expert in washing machines. Well, at least with the washing machine that was  _ theirs. _  He never denied the company, however, and Taehyung could never stay still for too long, not even when he was lying down. \u201cGod, Tae, that was too much detergent.\u201d  \u201cThat\u2019s what you put the last time! I paid attention.\u201d  His forehead creases, lips pressed tightly together on a pout. \u201cYeah, and we found out that night that it was too much detergent! And we had a lot more clothes inside back then\u2026\u201d They were getting the hang of the whole house chores thing, the days where clothes would pile up until they were almost a living creature left way behind them. They exchange quizzical looks. Taehyung\u2019s smile is practically sly as he pushes the start button. \u201cWe\u2019ll have to wash it all twice. Mark my words.\u201d Jungkook sighs, defeated. \u201cWanna bet?\u201d  That makes him take a 180 degrees turn. \u201cWhat?\u201d  \u201cDinner. It\u2019s on me if you\u2019re right. You can choose.\u201d  \u201cWill we go out?\u201d  \u201cSure. Not too far, though, I know you\u2019re tired.\u201d  Jungkook shrugs. He is, and so must be Taehyung \u2014 it was a long week \u2014 , but they rarely ever go out to eat. \u201cDeal.\u201d  They deal with the first batch of clothes while the washing machine works, and soon the foam leaking out of the machinery\u2019s door is a good enough indicative that, yeah, Jungkook was right after all. Unfortunately, they only notice the foam the moment when Taehyung slips on it. It all happens in slow motion right in front of Jungkook\u2019s widened eyes. A jacket is thrown to the ceiling, Taehyung\u2019s arms reaching for any kind of support as he falls to his imminent death. Or so it looks like, which prompts Jungkook to react as fast and best as he can. That doesn\u2019t guarantee, however, that the results are anything different from the both of them falling down, weirdly tangled, but all the heads involved in the disaster are  _ safely  _ away from the floor and all the pointy corners surrounding them. \u201cOuch, my ass.\u201d  Jungkook breathes in a ridiculous amount of air. \u201cLeast it wasn\u2019t that thing attached to your neck which apparently you never use for anything at all.\u201d  \u201cHey! No need to get all aggressive on me now.\u201d  Jungkook grunts. \u201cMy back\u2026\u201d  Taehyung scrambles to get off of him, sitting up. \u201cDid you hit it somewhere? Are you hurt?

My hero.\u201d  \u201cDon\u2019t go quoting anime on me right now.\u201d  \u201cI\u2019m only quoting because you can recognize it, otherwise I\u2019d just be  _ saying _ it. It\u2019s a normal phrase, you weeb. People say that all the time.\u201d  \u201cThe frequency and the generalization are both highly debatable. Anyway, I win.\u201d  \u201cHuh?\u201d  \u201cThe bet. I want barbecue, by the way.\u201d  \u201cHuuh?\u201d Taehyung\u2019s face gets impossibly close, closer than it was when they were literally tangled. \u201cYou\u2019re really going for my savings here, Koo.\u201d  Jungkook laughs, which grants him foam at his right cheek. Foam he never saw coming because he had a serious case of Taehyung tunnel-vision. But even after a battle with the detergent\u2019s foam\u2014there are no winners, both of them sticky and dirty \u2014 , and the shower they have to take while the washing machine works for the second time, Taehyung never mentions it again. \u201cHey, we don\u2019t really have to\u2026\u201d  \u201cShh, I was just playing with you. Barbecue is great, actually. That\u2019s what money\u2019s for, right?\u201d  Taehyung\u2019s face disappears behind a floral shirt, and they resume hanging out the clothes. \u201cEating?\u201d  The shirt wavers as he hears a chuckle. \u201cThat, too.\u201d  _ And what else? _  Jungkook waits, but Taehyung never explains himself. \t4. Chapter 4  \u201cOh, I\u2019m sorry, I have plans for tonight already.\u201d  Jiwoo\u2019s smile doesn\u2019t waver, as kind and collected as it was a moment ago, when she offered an invitation to the pub nearby, along with at least half of their musicians. \u201cWhere are you going? Perhaps we can meet at some point\u2026 just to say hi? It\u2019s a group hangout, after all.\u201d  \u201cHahah, I don\u2019t think that will happen, no, my plans involve staying in.\u201d  \u201cReally? You could do that another time, though\u2026\u201d  Has he been avoiding hanging out with his coworkers that much? No, not really, they almost never did this kind of thing, maybe that\u2019s why Jiwoo was being so forceful. However, she wasn\u2019t being invasive. Her tone was respectful and inviting. \u201cDefinitely not, no, I promised Jungkook we would do a movie marathon and eat popcorn. He\u2019s never going to forgive me if I make him leave the house instead. To a pub.\u201d  He laughs, and Jiwoo nods, tilting her head. \u201cCute.\u201d  \u201cHm?\u201d Taehyung blinks, not sure if he got it right. _Cute?_  \u201cYour friendship is really cute, you must really care about him.\u201d  \u201cOf course I do! I care about all of my friends.\u201d  Even as he says it, Taehyung feels the lie on his tongue. It tastes weird, and kind of bitter, because it isn\u2019t a lie. He\u00a0 _is_ a good friend, always has been, and he\u2019s got a pretty chunky list of people who could vow to that. But\u2026 it\u2019s a lot more than his responsibility as a friend, here. And of course, of course it is, Jungkook is a very dear friend with whom Taehyung really enjoys to spend time with. So why the hell would he cancel on Jungkook, if he actually had been waiting for their night in the whole week? He never voices that, parting ways a little awkwardly. It\u2019s like Jiwoo is waiting for something he\u2019s got no idea _what_ might be. Luckily, he doesn\u2019t dwell too long on it. Taehyung goes to the nearest market and buys ice cream too, mint chocolate flavored because it's Jungkook's favorite, and soon enough he is home. No one questioning him, only popcorn and a movie night with Jungkook ahead of him. Who would even dare to prefer a pub to this? Everything\u2019s already arranged, even if Jungkook isn\u2019t on sight",

He puts his shoes away before answering. \u201cYep.\u201d  \u201cGo shower, I\u2019m cooking lamen.\u201d  \u201cCooking, right,\u201d Taehyung teases, entering the small kitchen and going for the freezer. Jungkook stops midway what would possibly be a complain the second he sees what Taehyung is doing. \u201cIce cream? Is it ice cream?\u201d  Taehyung shrugs, hiding the package as best as he can as he stores it inside the refrigerator. \u201cIt\u2019s a surprise.\u201d  The faintest smile passes through Jungkook\u2019s frame before he fakes annoyance, furrowing his eyebrows and frowning. Taehyung sprints to his bathroom, taking the quickest shower of his entire life and rushing back to the cozy living room, where he finds Jungkook this time around, sitting surrounded by the pillows, and starring the lamen cups with big, hungry eyes. \u201cOnly four?\u201d  He points to the floor beside him, where another four lamen cups remain closed, next to a thermal jug which is probably filled with hot water. Of _course_ there was more. Taehyung sits by Jungkook\u2019s side and they start their marathon, burning their tongues and crying from the extra spice of the lamens, emptying a few water bottles before finishing six of the eight cups. It\u2019s comfortable between them, intimacy coming naturally with gentle and tender touches, even when Jungkook pokes his ribs, or Taehyung flicks his earlobe, this is even more comfortable than the nest made of pillows and blankets on the floor. There isn't much space left for the popcorn after that, but they manage. And desserts get a whole other stomach for them, Jungkook's eyes shining so brightly it almost blinds Taehyung in the darkness of their home. They eat from the pot, and Jungkook almost gets a brain freeze, saved by Taehyung physically pulling it away from his grip. The movies are dumb, zombie comedies, and they manage to get to the third one before Jungkook starts to doze off, head falling on Taehyung\u2019s shoulder. Still, he struggles against the sleep, refusing to go to bed and pretending to be awake every time Taehyung says something. He can\u2019t help but smile fondly, and discreetly try to make their position more adequate for Jungkook to sleep. They have two beds, and a perfectly good sofa, but every once in a while sleeping on the living room floor isn\u2019t that bad, either. \t5. Chapter 5  He only ever heads back home by himself if there\u2019s something waiting for him to do that can\u2019t be dealt with later. Most times, there\u2019s a lot he can do near work: groceries, bookstores, malls. The possibilities are endless, and time waiting for Taehyung is too scarce for him to even notice. Soon enough his phone chimes and it certainly is Taehyung asking if he\u2019s still around. Sometimes he heads home first, even cooks a little something for dinner\u2014Taehyung always praises his food, and Jungkook thinks he\u2019s just talking his ears off because he wants Jungkook to cook more. Either way, he can\u2019t deny that it works a _little._ And he himself thinks his food isn\u2019t half as bad as it could be. But one thing rarely changes, even during the weekends. It\u2019s almost as if Taehyung _puts him to bed._  Not literally, Jungkook isn\u2019t a kid anymore, but he is kind of an insomniac. Taehyung has his own moments, too, but Jungkook is really worse. He forgets to sleep, he doesn\u2019t notice the time passing by, and he\u2019s awful at dealing with his own insomnia. The biggest proof of that is: He has some sick playlists to help him sleep, but does he remember to use them? So the first thing that happens is: Taehyung brews him some tea. And Taehyung takes that pretty seriously\u2014he\u2019s studied all kinds of plants and herbs after the best teas he could make to help Jungkook. They are ridiculously good, too, and how Taehyung manages this is out of his comprehension",

He\u2019s always liked Taehyung\u2019s voice, that ain\u2019t something new. Listening to it to sleep has its disadvantages\u2014that\u2019s how the dreams started\u2014, but are they really disadvantages? When the tea ends, Taehyung drags Jungkook to bed and keeps talking his ears off. Jungkook talks back, too, some times more than others, but his tongue drags heavier inside his mouth. His own voice is deeper than usual, letting his tiredness show. The tea sure has an effect, his eyelids can barely hold up, and he _likes_ to hear Taehyung talk. Taehyung can be silent for long times, and Jungkook likes that, too, but Taehyung\u2019s voice seems to make his heart overflow. Sadly, it\u2019s not always that Taehyung stays. For some reason Jungkook can\u2019t understand, he has to go to his own bed. He considers disposing of Taehyung\u2019s bed a few times, but then he would have to give up the times Taehyung invited him to his bed instead of joining in Jungkook\u2019s one, and he wasn\u2019t ready for that yet. It was nice and different when they watched a drama or anime in _Taehyung\u2019s_ bed. And Taehyung _invited_ him to stay. Jungkook liked sleeping in Taehyung\u2019s bed too, and for that to keep happening Taehyung had to have his own bed. Unfortunately. Watching anime before bed is a big no\u2014they both get way too excited, and end up sleeping way past one in the morning. That, sometimes, happens. But not much. Taehyung takes sleeping seriously, for his sake. Which is why most of the times he leaves Jungkook\u2019s bed when he thinks Jungkook is already asleep, Jungkook won\u2019t say anything. Most times, however, aren\u2019t tonight. On some rare occasions such as now, Jungkook reaches his left hand, towards Taehyung\u2019s wrist, and grabs it gently. \u201cYou\u2019re still awake?\u201d Taehyung whispers, surprised. They barely slept that Saturday, waking up to sunlight on their faces because the living room windows are big and the curtains translucent. The movie marathon the night before had Jungkook sleeping on the floor, he just didn\u2019t want it to end. \u201cBarely,\u201d he answers, not even opening his eyes. Taehyung waits in silence for a moment, then asks: \u201cYou want something?\u201d   _Stay,_ Jungkook thinks. _You don\u2019t have to go._  \u201cNah,\u201d he answers instead, suddenly way more nervous than he should be. What was he thinking? Why did he reach for Taehyung when Taehyung clearly wanted to leave? \u201c... Then?\u201d  Jungkook loosens the grip on Taehyung\u2019s wrist, pulling back. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing. Sorry.\u201d  Silence befalls the room, Taehyung isn\u2019t moving and Jungkook is definitely getting more anxious by the second. He opens his eyes at the same time Taehyung lays down again. \u201cI\u2019m staying. My job here isn\u2019t done yet.\u201d  Jungkook chuckles, closing his eyes again in a dumb attempt at hiding his embarrassment. \u201cThat\u2019s not your _job_.\u201d  \u201cHmph. Who said that?\u201d He can hear Taehyung moving closer, until his body is wrapping around Jungkook\u2019s waist, pressing his face against Taehyung\u2019s chest. \u201cThey\u2019re right, but only because I\u2019m doing this because I want to. Now, let\u2019s go to sleep, Koo. Good night.\u201d  Jungkook lets out a breath he didn\u2019t know he was holding. \u201cNight.\u201d  It\u2019s a little strangled, but Taehyung tightens the embrace and runs his fingers through Jungkook\u2019s hair, and soon enough he\u2019s not conscious enough to be nervous about anything at all. \t6",

Jungkook spaces out through most of it, dutifully pushing the shopping cart, even though he enjoys the food bits. And there are always food bits, no matter how many times they hit the market. \u201cDetergent _again_?\u201d Jungkook asks, startled to see it inside their cart. \u201cYes? Have you seen the number of dishes we make?\u201d  \u201cHave you seen the amount of _laundry_ we make? And we\u2019re not buying detergent for _that_ again.\u201d  Taehyung shakes his head, chuckling. \u201cOh, honey, that\u2019s not how this works.\u201d  Jungkook\u2019s face heats up instantly, and he focuses on hiding it instead of arguing. Taehyung must be right, he\u2019s the one who can\u2019t see a single spoon on the kitchen sink before he\u2019s doing the dishes again. A worker nearby drops one of the cans she\u2019s piling up on the bottom shelf, attracting both their eyes for a second. \u201cAnyway, last time we bought this was just a test, sometimes I\u2019m allergic to detergents. This one is good, though, and it\u2019s cheaper too, so we\u2019re buying more.\u201d  Jungkook shrugs. \u201cFair enough.\u201d  \u201cWhat else is on the list?\u201d  \u201cCereals. And eggs.\u201d  \u201cOh, this way then!\u201d  They stop when there\u2019s enough to fill four\u2014ecological\u2014bags, heading to the single counter and waiting for the cashier to come. It\u2019s a small market, a little farther from their apartment building than other markets, but Taehyung likes to support local businesses such as this one. And so does Jungkook, who also appreciates the extras they get whenever the owners are around, and the homemade treats they always have. \u201cLook, Tae, homemade melonpan!\u201d  Taehyung eyes it with curiosity. Their melonpan is his favorite. \u201cIs it fresh?\u201d  Before Jungkook can check the date, the same worker from before answers, assuming the cashier\u2019s place. \u201cYes! They were baked today.\u201d  \u201cCan we buy them? Can we, Tae?\u201d  Jungkook\u2019s eyes sparkle, as if Taehyung was ever going to deny him and he needed to resort to such a low trick. \u201cSure, you big baby.\u201d  The woman chuckles as Jungkook gets them _four_ packages, and Taehyung flicks his earlobe and messes with his hair, almost annoyed with his cuteness. \u201cHow long have you two been together, if you don\u2019t mind me asking?\u201d  Taehyung\u2019s smile fades into confusion as he stops looking at Jungkook and turns to the cashier. \u201cUh?\u201d It\u2019s Jungkook who asks, though, eyes big and curious. The cashier fumbles with the groceries, visibly flustered. \u201cUm, you two live together, right?\u201d  \u201cYeah, but\u2026\u201d  Taehyung interrupts him, throwing his arm around Jungkook\u2019s shoulders. \u201cAlmost two years, ain\u2019t it, Koo?\u201d  \u201cHuh? Tae, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s what-\u201d  Taehyung nods, turning back to her. \u201cAlmost two years now!\u201d  The woman nods, smiling shyly. \u201cYou\u2026 both seem really happy, that\u2019s all. Sorry if I stepped out of line...\u201d  \u201cNot at all! We don\u2019t really keep track of time because it\u2019s just so effortless. Time passes too fast. I am happy. Aren\u2019t you, Koo?\u201d  Jungkook nods, albeit visibly stunned. The cashier finishes helping them with their groceries, and as soon as they step out of the market, Jungkook says, very slowly:  \u201cI have no idea what just happened.\u201d  Taehyung laughs, nerves hidden by how loud he allows himself to be now that they\u2019re out in the open. \u201cMr. and Ms",

This is why he\u2019s usually the first one to wake up, and not the other way around.

Breakfast is ready, you have five minutes to get ready and move your ass to the kitchen.\u201d  \u201cHarsh.\u201d  In truth, it\u2019s really hard to wake up and get ready fast when the perspective of running a marathon is the only thing on his horizon.

Anyway, Yoongi is the one trying to impress someone.\u201d  \u201c _What_?\u201d  Jungkook laughs, pretending to be too busy with his game to reply as Taehyung eats his cereal. Is everyone on their orchestra group of friends dating or _interested_ in dating someone? That\u2019s just absurd. Yeah, they\u2019re all pretty cute, yes, but dating? A relationship? It just sounds\u2026 No, Taehyung can\u2019t see that. _Wait._ But what about Jungkook? \u201cSo\u2026\u201d He starts, instantly earning a glare from Jungkook. In turn, he apparently dies in the game he was playing, so Taehyung gets more than two seconds of his attention. \u201cHave _you_ got your eyes on anyone?\u201d  Jungkook coughs like he\u2019s choked on something, perhaps air. \u201cWhat?\u201d  \u201cEveryone\u2019s dating or something, apparently. I thought you might\u2019ve been, too?\u201d  \u201cNo. _No,_ \u201d Jungkook repeats, with extra emphasis. \u201cNot dating?\u201d  \u201cNo.\u201d  \u201cNot even any crushes?\u201d  \u201cWe should get going.\u201d  \u201cOh?\u201d He looks down at his bowl, finding it still half-full. \u201cBut I\u2019m not finished. Koo-\u201d  He drinks it in a hurry, praying it won\u2019t be too bad for his stomach, and rushes to the front door where Jungkook awaits still looking flustered. Or mad, because they\u2019re late? Or both. The marathon isn\u2019t too far, but they need to catch a bus first. Still, they\u2019re pretty on time\u2014Hoseok compliments their punctuality and Taehyung raises an eyebrow at Jungkook, who simply ignores him. It\u2019s not as bad as it seemed to be now that they\u2019re here. It\u2019s a nice day, not cold but not hot either, and of Taehyung manages to take it easy, he\u2019s positive he can reach the finish line. He does the stretching carefully, with Jungkook\u2019s help. Jungkook is probably ending the marathon in first place, the way he\u2019s always exercising around the apartment and going out for night or morning runs at ass o\u2019clock. He even looks like a natural, like he\u2019s a part of this environment instead of one of the people brought by a friend. He goes around helping everyone he can, morning sunlight hitting the most prominent features of his face and catching Taehyung\u2019s eyes. Taehyung squints, but doesn\u2019t look away",

It was way better running along with you than it is running by myself every day. I\u2019ll keep up with you, and we don\u2019t have to go every day. _Please._ \u201d  That\u2019s true. Jungkook had kept his pace throughout the whole marathon, and that was probably why Taehyung had actually crossed the finish line. It was just impossible to resist Jungkook\u2019s puppy eyes. It was a trap all along, and Taehyung should have known it. \u201cFine.\u201d  Jungkook\u2019s face lights up instantly, and Taehyung almost feels good with himself for being the cause for his euphoria. A blond drops by Jungkook\u2019s side at the crosswalk, offering Taehyung a cold water bottle. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t even that hard.\u201d  And, truly, he\u2019s barely breaking any sweat. In fact, Yoongi looks almost _exactly_ like he did right before the marathon. Jungkook only chuckles by his side, and something clicks inside Taehyung\u2019s head. \u201cBastard. You called a taxi, didn\u2019t you?\u201d  Yoongi feigns innocence and utter bafflement. \u201cI would _never_ think of something like that.\u201d \t8. Chapter 8  The one thing Jungkook always tried to avoid was a matter of principle. Borrowing clothes from Taehyung was completely out of line. Because he had feelings Taehyung wasn\u2019t aware of, and he could never wear even a t-shirt from Taehyung without feeling stupidly giddy about it. This self-imposed rule only made him really good at having a tight schedule for their laundries. However. The weather was something Jungkook couldn\u2019t control just yet, and walking around the apartment without a t-shirt? That is fine. Going out in the cold weather without a hoodie? Well, that\u2019s just not as fine. Luckily, Jungkook wouldn\u2019t have to leave the house before his hoodies were all dry and ready to go, because it was still Sunday. \u201cOkay, we have like\u2026 six clothing items, together.\u201d Taehyung states, scientifically. \u201cI\u2019ll just stay under the blankets the whole day.\u201d  Taehyung chuckles, leaning into him. It makes everything inside Jungkook lights up, but he does his best to remain still. \u201cDon\u2019t be dumb, you should wear this.\u201d   And maybe it\u2019s because the specific item of clothing is so unexpected that Jungkook\u2019s brain comes to a halt, but he can\u2019t deny it. He ends up promptly accepting the pastel yellow crop top (crop top???) with long sleeves and then it\u2019s too late to deny it. Taehyung is happily singsonging to his favorite song (at the moment) and waltzing away from the laundry room, and Jungkook tries the crop top on  _ just because. _ It has their laundry\u2019s smell, after all, it shouldn\u2019t be that dangerous. \u2026 Except for the fact that he can\u2019t stop imagining Taehyung wearing this exact piece of clothing. When? In which context? Why hadn\u2019t Jungkook heard  _ anything  _ about this? They literally _ lived together. _  He can t deny the clothing item is fairly comfortable, and wearing nothing isn\u2019t exactly appalling when it\u2019s almost snowing outside.

So. \u201cMines are finally dry,\u201d Jungkoook offers, in exchange for the crop top offer earlier. \u201cLook, it was an unexpected change of weather, we couldn\u2019t have known,\u201d Taehyung says, already wearing Jungkook\u2019s jacket, not sure about what he\u2019s even accepting, only worried about not catching a cold. \u201cYeah,\u201d Jungkook agrees, reluctantly. But there\u2019s not much he can do. His selfish feelings have absolutely nothing to do with this. \u2b52\u2b51\u2b52\u2b51\u2b52  Namjoon saw them getting in the restaurant and gasps when he sees what Taehyung is wearing because there, at Taehyung\u2019s back, is Jungkook\u2019s name. Printed on fabric. Everyone is shellshocked, and then Seokjin says, \u201cCongrats on the relationship update! !\u201d  Jungkook looked confused and even more so Taehyung, even from afar, but their friends were just happy. They come to their table and greet everyone, Jungkook getting redder by the second. \u201cFucking finally,\u201d Jimin says, making space for them right by his side. \u201cWe can order now.\u201d  \u201cIt was about time,\u201d Hoseok says, winking Jungkook\u2019s way. Taehyung looks from Hoseok to Jungkook, and the later avoids him. \u201cTo order food?\u201d  \u201cYeah, sure,\u201d Hoseok winks again, and Taehyung looks like he\u2019s about to lose it. They choose a meal course to share, neither of them super hungry but both wanting extra fries, and even though that\u2019s usual, every single person on their table sighs, calling them disgusting,  _ of fucking course they\u2019re gonna share. _ And that\u2019s when Taehyung loses it. He stands up, shouting \u201cRestroom!\u201d and dragging Jungkook along with him. \u201cWhy does everyone seem to think that we\u2019re dating now?\u201d  Jungkook hides further inside his hoodie. \u201cIt\u2019s the jacket. The one I lent you.\u201d  \u201cWhat about it? I mean, what if they know it\u2019s yours, what does it have to do with\u2026\u201d  \u201cHmm, it\u2019s my university\u2019s varsity jacket.\u201d  Taehyung looks right into his eyes, in complete silence. \u201cOh.\u201d  \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I just- you needed something, and it was dry, and-\u201d  \u201cYou let me borrow your varsity jacket! That\u2019s so cute. _ Cutie. _ It\u2019s an honor, I can\u2019t believe it. I need a mirror, might snap some pics since we\u2019re here, I\u2019m wearing your varsity fucking jacket oh my god-\u201d  Jungkook is caught between dying and punching Taehyung, so he obviously only groans instead. \u201cTaehyung\u2026\u201d  \u201cYeah, join the photo, come here!\u201d  He ceases resisting Taehyung\u2019s shenanigans and just enjoys the moment. He deserves it, Taehyung being ridiculous and posing a hundred different ways to show off Jungkook\u2019s jacket is something he should be enjoying to the fullest. Christ",

Something changes right there and then, and Jungkook mentally sighs. This is why there was a rule, and he should have never borrowed any piece of clothing from Taehyung.

Someone said Jungkook didn't like kisses, neither giving or receiving them, and Taehyung scoffed and said Jungkook also didn't happen to like hugs, and **still** , Taehyung could hug him whenever he felt like it. \"So kiss him, then.\" Jimin provoked. Taehyung did. On Jungkook's right cheek, for whole three seconds and a half. Yes, Jungkook did count. He couldn't breathe for the whole thing, but right after it he put his tongue out for his friends, walking away as Taehyung puffed his chest looking very proud of himself. Jungkook laughed when he was at a safe distance, thinking of Taehyung showing off like a peacock for being allowed to kiss Jungkook's cheek. He was so dumb. And _endearing._  That's why he could get away with everything, although back then Jungkook wasn't aware of that. Not fully. Jimin looked quite full of himself, later. He had no idea why.",
    "Agent (2024-05-20 13:28:19.351763): Option 2:\n\n  It was during their choir days at college, maybe even before the Orchestra, that Taehyung first started to invite Jungkook to his family's place for meals. \"My mum puts too much food on the table,\" he said in a half-hearted attempt at chuckling, \"I just can't eat that much myself, and she'll be happier if there's someone new to feed.\"\n\n  And, indeed, Taehyung's mum failed miserably in her spyng attempts that first time Jungkook visited. She'd made more than a simple intro question. She'd ask him about his parents' whereabouts, what his future prospects were\u2014literally, a detective trying to crack a hard shell, never getting she was too obvious. Too much so. Jungkook had, politely but professionally, always sent her questions back where they'd come from.\n\n  Taehyung was mortified. It wasn't as if Jungkook was a undeserving guest, on any terms. Either if it was character or music, actually, everyone liked Jungkook. The way he was never ready to brag about being a genius pianist\u2014but had an incredibly rare gift, of course according to Taehyung's own opinion and the amount of people who'd gone for auditions and ended up being unable to meet the passing grades\u2014, or even the way he copied Taehyung's lead, his moral compass, and how he tried his best to follow his advice, it all appealed to Taehyung's mum's grumpy nature. But she wasn't right to investigate that way.\n\n  So he had to intervene, and that's where laying bare his feelings came into place. He sat her down, told her\u2014threatened her, maybe, he felt like\u2014they were friends, and that was it, he swore on his life that he was _not_ going anywhere with Jungkook, and Jungkook  _ hadn't done anything but to look at the back of Taehyung's head, ever. _ Ever!_\n\n  Taehyung couldn't keep his heart from speeding up when he spoke those words to his mum, told her  _ that. _ It was true, right? Jungkook hadn't even looked at him romantically. He'd tried to kiss him that time, he's sure he did, but only because he was drunk and probably thought it would be fun, and Jungkook simply wasn't interested. Probably.\n\n  Jungkook left as soon as he could. It was the first time he'd been in Taehyung's house, after all. Taehyung powered through a half-hearted dinner, went to his room and tons of theories came to his head. By the end of the night, he wasn't even sure if he'd been interested in Jungkook that way.\n\n  Taehyung's mum called him out on it a week later. \"You weren't being honest with me, son. I know it.\" She'd never called him \"son\" before.\n\n  Every time Jungkook visited after that he was always greeted with a smile and endless positives gossip about \"his friend\" that made Taehyung want to roll his eyes but he couldn't, for the fear of raising suspicions. He was sure Jungkook hadn't told anyone, he hadn't even told Taehyung that mom had called him a \"friend\", so, it should have been her personal observations... but still. His mum couldn't be trusted anymore when it came to Jungkook, so, what if something did happen and she figured it out again?\n\n  Taehyung had just introduced him as the guy he hung out with that day, \"actually, he's joining the orchestra, pretty cool!\"\u2014because Jungkook wasn't even part of the Choir. The full college Orchestra was his real goal, though. It didn't work. His mum knew Jungkook was in the Choir because she made Taehyung tell details. That's when she said it. _\"The piano guy is your friend?\"_\n\n  Taehyung told himself two things: one, he had to keep Jungkook away from home at all costs and, two... he had to lie, he had to lie so bad his mum would never even believe the word \"friend\" has anything to do with Jungkook in Taehyung's life. And he told her so, a heavy sigh, a crossed heart, a dear God, please never leave me alone with that desperate piano guy, that fool, that hopeless idiot. His mum could only laugh and tell him: _\"Well, you're in kinda deep, huh?\"_\n\n  Taehyung had that hot, clammy feeling he got when he knew he'd been caught out on something, but, he suddenly got it. _Mom's testing me._ She just guesses, she's just observing the facts and thinks, but she doesn't know, not without confirmation, and so Taehyung guessed even louder, told his mum a story of how he had a crush on  _the piano guy for the past five years [_\"more, actually, but no matter\"_ ] but, Jungkook wasn't receptive of his romantic affections. It was a truth Taehyung hadn't admitted to himself before then, and he surely didn't want to see his mum's reaction to it, but... he was a grown man now, after all, and he couldn't keep on going on this way admitting his feelings and expecting his mum not to notice, and he might not keep on going this way, actually. He could, Keep on going this way, and not call him anything but his \"friend\". But it wouldn't go on any longer, that was for sure.\n\n  So he told his mum. Taehyung confessed to his mum that he'd been in love with Jungkook for God knows how long, and, indeed, he kept going on. He couldn't help it, but his mum knew. Still, Jungkook couldn't go back to the house and he'd never have to know Taehyung had told his mum. And, that's exactly what he did\u2014kept going on for almost three years. Three years without inviting Jungkook to majority\u2014there's a few exceptions\u2014of his family dinners, but that sucked, and if he could live with that, he could live far much better with not revealing that he was in love with the person that had just joined the ritzy Orchestra.  And so he did.\n\n  Taehyung left the Choir before graduating, knowing he was bound for the Orchestra. He took the extra year to sort his feelings out. It was _okay,_ like this, at least, he wouldn't do something that would probably end with Taehyung not being able to treat Jungkook as a friend anymore, and the orchestra needed friends. Jungkook kept on going, to the Choir, to the Orchestra, his college auditions were never a _maybe,_ and, for once, Jungkook wouldn't have to work extra hard to get there. He was just... jungkook.  Taehyung left the Choir knowing he had to forget jungkook\u2014or die trying\u2014but he surprised himself being the nice initiate that he used to be, asking jungkook for help, abstaining from gifting him anything, and the times they talked or hung out, he was just being his regular self, never trying to be better than he was or promoting his own good qualities over jungkook's bad but, the less Taehyung spoke or thought about jungkook, the more he made the mistake of doing, maybe too often, and he couldn't break the orbit he was stuck in, ruled by this obsession he just couldn't forget him the way he'd wanted, he needed his distance.  As time went on, jungkook's influence reached every kind of corner jungkook's surname didn't. Taehyung decided to go back to college and finish choir, actually graduate with it, for once his passion had a significant pay, making him not need to go for any of the subjects he hated. He could do Music Theory and Voice lessons, there sure were some sad times where he couldn't live with that, but he managed to keep it up and he even made friends in his new class, no one had ever met jungkook, and Taehyung would gladly keep it that way. \n\n  Taehyung went at the end of each day to the parts of his college frequented by jungkook, hoping to see him, and he did. And, Jungkook looked happy, he always did, actually, and whenever jungkook noticed him watching, jungkook would smile, or raise a hand, even wait for Taehyung after choir practice some times so they could have dinner together. Taehyung could see him growing closer, confidant with the other students, especially the girls, or so Taehyung thinks. None of them looked like jungkook with their skinny legs and witless mouths, wekk, one or two of them looked hot, and jungkook obviously liked them, probably. _No, probably not, jungkook would never fall into something like that. Maybe he would. Who cares? I mean, he probably would, who wouldn't have a crush on jungkook? Yeah, I guess, who wouldn't? He looked good, always sharing lamen mazala with a girl in some igloo shop on the dead part of town. He\u2019d bring the same lamen with him for lunch, and he looked good. Very good, opening the door for her, sharing kisses, vanilla selfies and girls\u2019 kisses with them that jungkook was outside, not meant for jungkook to see at all, and",
    "Test (2024-05-20 13:28:19.359244): Option 2:\n\n\t9. Chapter 9  Taehyung wakes up a little more sluggish than usual, cheeks flushed like he\u2019s feverish, but Jungkook pressures him into taking his temperature and the thermometer gives them nothing. That\u2019s not enough to put Jungkook at ease\u2014the weather change was really unexpected, and he knows too damn well just how susceptible to them Taehyung is. While Jungkook\u2019s been dealing with his allergies throughout his whole life, Taehyung rarely ever gets sick. He\u2019s got iron immunity, superhero worthy, but every time Taehyung does get sick, it\u2019s official hospital visiting hours. Even his colds look like a new damn virus just got brought into the world. Maybe Jungkook is a little too impressionable, maybe he\u2019s worrying too much. However, as long as there\u2019s a probability he could be even remotely right, he\u2019s not going to change. Luckily so, because this time turns out to be one of the few times he\u2019s actually right, and when Taehyung almost passes out while standing, Jungkook is right here to catch him.",
    "Agent (2024-05-20 13:28:22.727611): Now which one do you want?",
    "Test (2024-05-20 13:28:22.730840): Option 3:\n\n\t9. Should I talk to you or not? There\u2019s nothing that could bring two people together more than Family visits. When Jungkook\u2019s birthday is right around the corner and they will be on the road doing concerts during it, Taehyung knows what is coming. And there\u2019s no escape. It\u2019s not that they dislike their families \u2013 completely not their case, at all, but the timing. Always the timing. \u201cI\u2019m going to die,\u201d Jungkook states, and Taehyung knows it\u2019s not drama because he feels it too. He feels it, but he needs to be the stronger one this time, and so he says \u201cIt\u2019s a day off, we\u2019ve been working day and night in preparation for this, right? We deserve a little rest, too. And just before we hit the road, just in time! It\u2019s perfect.\u201d  Jungkook\u2019s eyes beg for mercy, and they both know what Taehyung said is true, but they both also know that their families coming over for an early birthday celebration isn\u2019t what _rest_ is.",
    "Agent (2024-05-20 13:29:35.021540): Option 4:\n\n    Perhaps he\u2019s just better at hiding them. Maybe Taehyung has just gotten too accustomed to Jungkook\u2019s habits, learned to pick out the things that were once hard to spot as well. But it doesn't matter. Because no matter what is saying it, whether it's a healthy habit, or a unhealthily familiar one, his body, his eyes, the scarce, and unexpected and so painfully missed softness of his voice during these last eight conceivably endless eight months... It all tells something so strong to Taehyung\u2019s heart, to his very core, triggers something that simply can't be ignored anymore, and every time they occur, no matter how tiny they are, Taehyung goes up another step in the slow ascent to the point of no return. Taehyung feels himself getting drawn to Jungkook again, as if his immunity had faded already since last time they slept alongside happily, back when everything was still unbearably okay. _\u201cNo, Taehyung, let\u2019s rest.\u201d_ Jungkook\u2019s voice echoes in Taehyung\u2019s head as an unbearable weight crushes his chest. They couldn\u2019t understand it before, the attraction they had for one another that was never on his mind\u2026 maybe Jungkook\u2019s at that time. But still, they\u2019ve opened Pandora\u2019s box, unknowingly, and now it\u2019s too late. Jungkook has a huge complex, not treating himself the way he thinks he should, something Taehyung hadn\u2019t realized during their close days but he knows now. This is just the surface of it, but now Taehyung knows for sure\u2014and feels it. Taehyung needs to go to the hotel rooms of their next tour stops, so the band doesn\u2019t get anxious about him being missing for no apparent reason. He\u2019s also training Jungkook for staying in their apartment, so\u2026 yeah, something has to happen.  Taehyung is a pretty good teacher, just by hanging out close and letting everyone go their routine at ease, sensible instincts rising from deep within, and Jungkook quickly gets used to it, to being around Taehyung all the time. Taehyung is almost relieved. It\u2019s closer to normal than he thought, but it\u2019s also spouting deep waters that should never, ever be crossed, staring at him dead in the eyes. Jungkook gets hungry, and they eat together. Jungkook is still taking up half of the laundry limit in order to not wait too much time for his equals, and Taehyung does that on most of their days off. Jungkook\u2019s playful side gets triggered, and he reaches for Taehyung playfully to poke at his ribs (not too hard, but just hard enough) and pull at his earlobe. Not that Taehyung hates it, either, even when they\u2019re off the drinking diet. It\u2019s not harassment, it\u2019s something Taehyung knows Jungkook will never realize is too intimate, something where he\u2019s not at fault... but sometimes, _sometimes_ Taehyung is  _so hard for it  _ that he has step out for air.  Taehyung\u2019s been denying his feelings for a long time, hiding inside the very same little details of himself which he let Jungkook see once upon a time.  Jungkook\u2019s body always curls into him, by accident or not, making Taehyung have to remind himself he\u2019s in no disposition for this, to pay attention to every little motion Taehyung\u2019s doing and be worried of bumping into an obviously touch-averted Jungkook. And so, when Jungkook tries to lay down where he usually does, on the bed, feet on the pillows and head on the headrest, and Taehyung says  _no._ Jungkook mutters something as \u201cI- Don\u2019t- Want- To,\u201d which takes a moment for Taehyung to decipher.  _Still using baby talk, Jungkookie. With a drunk puppy. You better settle for the floor, that\u2019s what you\u2019re looking for. This is TaeTae\u2019s place, have you forgotten of our pact? Once again, and all-out education awaits, you poor guy. I feel sorry, Jungkook. It\u2019s your own fault. \u201cTae! Asleep, in a minute! But Koo, for real, go to sleep where you sleep, I won\u2019t let another moment go to waste. I\u2019m still paying for that last time, and I can\u2019t do it again even if I wanted to. Trust me._ Jungkook said he was in a way, right? More like Jungkook should have been ashamed for taking advantage of Taehyung _and_ him, but no, Jungkook\u2019s shameless, you\u2019d have to take care of him forever. Yeah, and it did take time, patience, and a hell of a lot of conviction from Taehyung. But it paid off in the end. Jungkook is almost never this way when sober, and Taehyung has no idea how they let do this situation get out of hand, knowing how well it ended last time. It was never about holding grudges. Jungkook\u2019s drunken mistakes far surpassed Taehyung\u2019s. They can think over that this time, loudly. Steps our adult Jungkookie will regret giving, and another lesson he\u2019s about to learn.  Taehyung knew that if he kept it up with the un denting remarks, with the hand slaps and the pinching, with pressing his leg on Jungkook\u2019s, while keeping on a healthy and polite voice like that of his mum, then eventually Jungkook would probably get the idea. He hopes. He doubts Jungkook will get the idea that, as he told him before getting as drowsy as pumped he was, perhaps his drunken self is the uncareful, wild and useless version one should drop like a stone. Jungkook was clearly not the kind of person to drop someone who\u2019s coming to the realization he\u2019s in love with the person who\u2019s so very patient with the, in spite of how un-thought-of their actions are when they drink too much. That\u2019s why jungkook needed someone with a little bit more\u2026 will, at least, to make sure they don\u2019t slip up. Again. But\u2026 Jungkook was also the kind of person to freak, to shut that person out. To run from them, to have the rest of their friends toss this new person away, because Jungkook didn't want a crush on his relationships. _Or a new relationship. With a crush, specifically. Possibly._ Jungkook\u2019s usually not this drunk, especially in a safe environment such as the apartment training session, but there\u2019s been too much surrounded by alcohol in the last couple of concerts. It\u2019s made Jungkook put up with the idea.  As long as Taehyung doesn\u2019t cross his boundaries, Jungkook insists, slurred drunk. Taehyung agrees, of course. While this position is much more compromised than he\u2019s ever seen before, Jungkook is _aware_ that he is also  _drunk,_ and he let Taehyung near, and Taehyung wouldn\u2019t take it any further, further than this, where he could always easily coast and listen to whatever the drunken Jungkook has to say. He also won\u2019t lose his head and be fooled by Jungkook\u2019s alcohol-craving, so he definitely won\u2019t push him beyond what\u2019s acceptable, the way jungkook did to Taehyung last time. Jungkook doesn\u2019t drink like how he should, but Taehyung does. He stops drinking as soon as he can call it a night or when jungkook is wasted out of his mind, but saying  _no_ after having a sip never went well with his past. Better not start them in the first place, keep the next morning hangover free for chill brunch. There\u2019s a new doubt in Jungkook\u2019s mind now, but, he\u2019s too focused on trying to find a spot in the apartment where he can draw, specifically on the whiteboard, to let it settle. Trying to have both his feet on the ground makes him lose balance, so he lifts one and spins around to move backwards, fall on a chair instead, before trying to dip his brush in the ink pot again.  It\u2019s now that Taehyung notices some liquid on jungkook\u2019s fingertips, even before jungkook can dip the brush.  \u201cYour hand\u2019s bleeding,\u201d he says. Jungkook stops his movement, eyes surprised, jaw slack, and them slump, face getting meek. Taehyung gets a soapy rag and then gently cleans jungkook\u2019s finger, before pressing a band aid on it. Jungkook watches, unsure still, but not focusing too much on the pain, with a too attached look. Jungkook drops the brush to the floor, then presses his breasts to Taehyung\u2019s back, resting his face on his shoulder, and arms extending to slip around his waist. No hug in their adult years have been like, this is a vulnerable Jungkook, one Taehyung isn\u2019t familiar with. But jungkook isn\u2019t holding back, and whatever boundaries, whatever concerns Taehyung has, whatever fears he thinks jungkook has got... those literally mean nothing as jungkook oversteps all of them in a very official way. And in a ready and in fiery tantrums if Taehyung doesn\u2019t respect them or obey his unspoken desires. Taehyung tries to talk himself out of it? Well, jungkook will talk himself in, and it",

Both of them, utterly destroy by pre-concert rehearsals. Normally, that\u2019s when they skip meals or eat sandwiches and bento boxes the most, not when Taehyung decides to give his try at the chef life. \u201cUm. Okay?\u201d  \u201cC\u2019mon, take a shower and let\u2019s do this. I\u2019m starving.\u201d  Jungkook silently agrees, just heading for his bathroom and showering. He knows he\u2019s been acting cold and distant, and what\u2019s worse, he feels that Taehyung knows it too. Maybe it\u2019s all in his head, but guilt still eats away at him. Taehyung has nothing to do with his feelings, and he shouldn\u2019t be affected by whatever goes on with them. Jungkook is a bad friend, he\u2019s a bad person, and these thoughts are bad because this is a difficult loop to escape.",

    "Test (2024-05-20 13:29:55.402832): Forget the chapters that I have read you and the potential continuations that I gave to you.",
    "Agent (2024-05-20 13:30:03.446534): Sure thing. Please feel free to initiate a new dialogue or activity by saying \"New topic\" or \"New conversation.\" I am always ready for a fresh start and happy to chat about a wide range of topics. I do not maintain any knowledge of the previous conversations you had with me in my memory. However, if you would like to revisit any of the previous conversations, I can always try to remember them if you provide me with enough context or information about the topic. Just let me know how I can assist you further."
