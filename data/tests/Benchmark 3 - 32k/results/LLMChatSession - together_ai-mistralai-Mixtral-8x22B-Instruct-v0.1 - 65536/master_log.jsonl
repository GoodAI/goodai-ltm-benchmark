Thoughts keep getting tangled in my head    This is a side of him that no one\u2019s ever seen. It\u2019s true for Taehyung too, but even more so for himself. It\u2019s not like he hasn\u2019t slept over friend\u2019s houses, or no one else has ever seen him sleeping before. But this. This is different. The light coming from the window is usually scarce, because Jungkook doesn\u2019t like waking up with the sun in his eyes, nor does Taehyung. However, the night before Taehyung had insisted that they should watch the stars together, because he\u2019s been studying them and he wanted to show everything he had learned to Jungkook as well. (Jungkook was studying them too, because he was really curious about things, especially things Taehyung was curious about, but he enjoyed to listen to Taehyung talk as if he was teaching him from scratch, his observations and words always beautiful and way more interesting than the ones Jungkook had read on the internet.) So, this time around, Taehyung\u2019s face is clear and bright under the morning light, the slope of his nose highlighted, each and every mole apparent, lips puffed and slightly parted, face squished against the pillow by Jungkook\u2019s side on Jungkook\u2019s bed. And Jungkook stares, because he\u2019s not fully awake just yet. He takes a while to wake up, always have, and therefore there\u2019s nothing to stop him from staring. Even blinking comes slow and lazily, and that has nothing to do with the fact he\u2019s a little hypnotized by the view. It\u2019s just how it is. How things are. How he is. Hopefully, how they are. It\u2019s simply not a step he\u2019s willing to take. Not right now. A step bigger than his legs are, that\u2019s what it feels like. He wants to reach for it, oh, Jungkook does. But that might scare Taehyung away. Taehyung isn\u2019t ready for that just yet. And that\u2019s really fine. Just, moments like this, under the rising sun, on his bed, by Taehyung\u2019s side, this feels all too different. Too beautiful, too good, too much. His chest aches, then, for something. A warmth. Someone. A proximity lacking, and he needs it then, as if his life depends on it, his chest is pulling Taehyung to him, begging, screaming, heart threatening to burst through if Jungkook doesn\u2019t do something, anything. Maybe it works, and the thing inside his chest is so strong that it manages to make Taehyung stir in his sleep, and literally roll to Jungkook\u2019s side. Or it\u2019s just Taehyung, being Taehyung, and squishing his face into Jungkook\u2019s chest is just way better than any pillow could ever be. He sighs in contentment, sinking further into Jungkook\u2019s aching chest, and in a moment it\u2019s like there was never any pain there, to begin with. I must be going crazy, is what Jungkook thinks, breathing through his nose as slowly and quietly as he can. \u201c\u2018Mmnornin, Koo.\u201d  A heartbeat\u2014one Taehyung certainly hears, left ear pressed against Jungkook\u2019s heart\u2014and a soft smile on Jungkook\u2019s lips as he replies, voice hoarse from sleep:  \u201cGood morning, Taetae.\u201d  And Jungkook is glad he gets to wake up like this a bunch of days. Because this. This is special. On other days he wakes up with a punch to the stomach, yeah, sometimes even with a pair of feet resting way too close to his face, but still. Still, this isn\u2019t something he\u2019d ever trade. \t2. Chapter 2  The bad thing about sleeping with Jungkook is the one thing that shouldn\u2019t be bad at all about sleeping. Only, it\u2019s 7h10 and Taehyung really needs to wake up, really needs to get ready to work, really needs to _get out of bed._  But capitalism.

Because it _is_ addicting. Once he found his way into Jungkook\u2019s bed, it was really hard to resist the urge of inviting himself in every night. He only did it for the sake of Jungkook not getting tired of him, and throwing him out of their shared apartment. \u201cKoo, we gotta wake up now.\u201d  Jungkook mumbles this time, maybe they took a ten minutes nap from the moment they exchanged good mornings. It happens frequently. Taehyung pokes his ribs, rather carefully, but the location guarantees an immediate reaction. The body under him moved, and Taehyung looks up to find an angry look pointed down at his face. \u201cMust you hurt me in order to wake me up, Taehyung?\u201d  \u201cYeah. Otherwise, you never do, not as fast as we need you to, at least. Plus, that didn\u2019t really hurt, you\u2019re just being a baby.\u201d  \u201cIt hurt. I\u2019m very sensitive when I wake up.\u201d  Taehyung almost beams at the slip-up, his day already made when his lips part and he pronounces very attentively:  \u201cOh?\u201d  Jungkook is torn between blushing and grunting, and that gets a pillow smashed into Taehyung\u2019s face. \u201cWhy are you like this?\u201d He rolls out of bed, maybe suppressing his laughter. Taehyung giggles, getting up too. \u201cThis is an important piece of information, Koo, I can tell your future girlfriend about it, and that\u2019s gonna be good for you later.\u201d  He winks, and Jungkook visibly rolls his eyes. \u201cYeah, and she wouldn\u2019t find it suspicious at all that you somehow seem to have this important piece of information.\u201d  Taehyung realizes\u00a0a lot of things at once, but the most important one is that Jungkook shouldn\u2019t get a girlfriend anytime soon. That would mean the end of their nights sleeping together. He feels too selfish to actually say that out loud, so he moved to the bathroom instead, Jungkook\u2019s bathroom, and grabbed his toothbrush, his extra toothbrush that has been used more times than his actual toothbrush, almost forgotten at his own bathroom. Still, Jungkook is too attentive to let something like this pass by unnoticed, his eyes are careful on Taehyung and some of the hairs on his nape bristle as an effect. Jungkook walks to his side and grabs his own toothbrush. \u201cWhat?\u201d  Taehyung stops brushing. \u201cPromise me one thing.\u201d  \u201cHuh?\u201d  \u201cJust say you\u2019ll promise me one thing.\u201d  Jungkook looks down to his toothbrush as he puts on some toothpaste. \u201cThat\u2019s already a promise, Tae.\u201d  \u201cWhatever. Then promise twice.\u201d  Jungkook smiles, rather softly. \u201cYeah, okay.\u201d  \u201cHm. Good.\u201d Taehyung takes the toothbrush off his mouth, and lowers himself to spit on the sink. When he rises again, Jungkook is brushing his teeth, waiting only mildly curiously. \u201cThen promise we\u2019ll still do everything we do now even if we start dating someone.\u201d  His brain supplies an \u201celse\u201d that stays on Taehyung\u2019s mind only, echoing like a disturbing horror movie sound. He\u2019s got no idea why he thought that, but it\u2019s probably just a habit, from usually saying the words \u201csomeone else\u201d together. Jungkook nods within a heartbeat, and that\u2019s enough to appease Taehyung messy head. Then he looks surprised, as if he had just understood what Taehyung has said. Not what he _asked,_ but what was being said behind all that. He\u2019s smug the rest of that hellish day, as Taehyung leaves to his own bathroom to shower (not before Jungkook purposely gets toothpaste on his nose), as they prepare tea and eat before leaving, on the way to the bus stop, all the way to the subway station, Jungkook doesn\u2019t utter a word but his smile says everything", "is_question": false}}

At some point, they started going to work together, then they were going to college together too, and sharing the touring road trips together, and suddenly they were\u2026 living under the same roof. It happened naturally. It was a better location, rent cheaper than they were paying before, because they could split the bills. It was only reasonable. And, well, the company was not unwelcome at all. Jungkook is a trainee now, recently graduated, so he usually arrives home first. Taehyung is a junior, and he\u2019s far from being a workaholic \u2014 that\u2019s easily a lot more like Jungkook \u2014 , but in between distractions he always comes home around eight p.m., while Jungkook is sometimes free even before six. Their roles on the Orchestra had nothing to do with their work titles \u2014 that was more salary and work hours related. Whereas Jungkook was a pianist, Taehyung played the cello. Neither of them were soloists yet, but their Orchestra was a little different than the most formal ones. This Thursday, however, Taehyung had promised to get home as soon as he could, so he could help Jungkook with the laundry. _ The laundry _ is a very specific procedure which Jungkook prefers to take care of himself. He had his own difficulties in the beginning, but by now he was quite the expert in washing machines. Well, at least with the washing machine that was  _ theirs. _  He never denied the company, however, and Taehyung could never stay still for too long, not even when he was lying down. \u201cGod, Tae, that was too much detergent.\u201d  \u201cThat\u2019s what you put the last time! I paid attention.\u201d  His forehead creases, lips pressed tightly together on a pout. \u201cYeah, and we found out that night that it was too much detergent! And we had a lot more clothes inside back then\u2026\u201d They were getting the hang of the whole house chores thing, the days where clothes would pile up until they were almost a living creature left way behind them. They exchange quizzical looks. Taehyung\u2019s smile is practically sly as he pushes the start button. \u201cWe\u2019ll have to wash it all twice. Mark my words.\u201d Jungkook sighs, defeated. \u201cWanna bet?\u201d  That makes him take a 180 degrees turn. \u201cWhat?\u201d  \u201cDinner. It\u2019s on me if you\u2019re right. You can choose.\u201d  \u201cWill we go out?\u201d  \u201cSure. Not too far, though, I know you\u2019re tired.\u201d  Jungkook shrugs. He is, and so must be Taehyung \u2014 it was a long week \u2014 , but they rarely ever go out to eat. \u201cDeal.\u201d  They deal with the first batch of clothes while the washing machine works, and soon the foam leaking out of the machinery\u2019s door is a good enough indicative that, yeah, Jungkook was right after all. Unfortunately, they only notice the foam the moment when Taehyung slips on it. It all happens in slow motion right in front of Jungkook\u2019s widened eyes. A jacket is thrown to the ceiling, Taehyung\u2019s arms reaching for any kind of support as he falls to his imminent death. Or so it looks like, which prompts Jungkook to react as fast and best as he can. That doesn\u2019t guarantee, however, that the results are anything different from the both of them falling down, weirdly tangled, but all the heads involved in the disaster are  _ safely  _ away from the floor and all the pointy corners surrounding them. \u201cOuch, my ass.\u201d  Jungkook breathes in a ridiculous amount of air. \u201cLeast it wasn\u2019t that thing attached to your neck which apparently you never use for anything at all.\u201d  \u201cHey! No need to get all aggressive on me now.\u201d  Jungkook grunts. \u201cMy back\u2026\u201d  Taehyung scrambles to get off of him, sitting up. \u201cDid you hit it somewhere? Are you hurt?

Barbecue is great, actually.

Perhaps we can meet at some point\u2026 just to say hi? It\u2019s a group hangout, after all.\u201d  \u201cHahah, I don\u2019t think that will happen, no, my plans involve staying in.\u201d  \u201cReally? You could do that another time, though\u2026\u201d  Has he been avoiding hanging out with his coworkers that much? No, not really, they almost never did this kind of thing, maybe that\u2019s why Jiwoo was being so forceful. However, she wasn\u2019t being invasive. Her tone was respectful and inviting. \u201cDefinitely not, no, I promised Jungkook we would do a movie marathon and eat popcorn. He\u2019s never going to forgive me if I make him leave the house instead. To a pub.\u201d  He laughs, and Jiwoo nods, tilting her head. \u201cCute.\u201d  \u201cHm?\u201d Taehyung blinks, not sure if he got it right. _Cute?_  \u201cYour friendship is really cute, you must really care about him.\u201d  \u201cOf course I do! I care about all of my friends.\u201d  Even as he says it, Taehyung feels the lie on his tongue. It tastes weird, and kind of bitter, because it isn\u2019t a lie. He\u00a0 _is_ a good friend, always has been, and he\u2019s got a pretty chunky list of people who could vow to that. But\u2026 it\u2019s a lot more than his responsibility as a friend, here. And of course, of course it is, Jungkook is a very dear friend with whom Taehyung really enjoys to spend time with. So why the hell would he cancel on Jungkook, if he actually had been waiting for their night in the whole week? He never voices that, parting ways a little awkwardly. It\u2019s like Jiwoo is waiting for something he\u2019s got no idea _what_ might be. Luckily, he doesn\u2019t dwell too long on it. Taehyung goes to the nearest market and buys ice cream too, mint chocolate flavored because it's Jungkook's favorite, and soon enough he is home. No one questioning him, only popcorn and a movie night with Jungkook ahead of him. Who would even dare to prefer a pub to this?

It wouldn\u2019t be the first time, after all, Jungkook was pretty forgetful when it came to little daily details they sometimes disagreed on. It wasn\u2019t like they spent all their time together, even though it might seem like it. They didn\u2019t know each other\u2019s schedules by heart. And yet Taehyung knows for sure they agreed on today. Maybe Jungkook had an unexpected assignment. Or perhaps he can\u2019t wait for his movie night and he\u2019s charging his phone somewhere. That happens quite a lot too, and in those cases, all Taehyung has to do is sprawl on their couch, turn the TV on and wait for his roommate. They usually end up talking over the movie anyways. Still, the fact that Jungkook is now nowhere to be seen makes Taehyung\u2019s restlessness creep up his spine. He\u2019s uneasy. And even though he hates it, he needs to make sure Jungkook is okay before he even starts to get ready for their evening. He could call out his name, but Taehyung decides to look around their shared apartment himself. It\u2019s not too big, nor it is small; their home has a nice balance between cozy and airy. Taehyung likes it here. He walks into their living room and that\u2019s when he sees it: Jungkook is sitting on their dark green couch. He looks peaceful and too quiet, and suddenly Taehyung wishes he didn\u2019t left all the lights turned off. Light would make it better for Jungkook. But there\u2019s not a light on here. Instead, the room is bathed in an eerie, deep blue glow from their balcony window. Taehyung looks through the window and sees a mass of clouds blocking the moon, but still, one of the skyscrapers\u2019 lights up the night. The city\u2019s illumination must be making its way through the room from the left.\u00a0\u201cKoo?\u201d Taehyung barely whispers. Even when Jungkook doesn\u2019t answer, Taehyung is sure he heard him. The tension on his shoulders eases just a little bit. The shapes suddenly start to come into focus,\u00a0 and then Taehyung can see that Jungkook is holding something on his hands. The moment he sees it, all the fear surges back, triple the size it was a moment ago. Taehyung is sure he\u2019s going to throw up. Jungkook is holding a sheet of paper, and his face is as white as the paper below his fingers. Taehyung\u2019s throat is too dry for him to say anything at all. Instead, his legs move as if they\u2019ve got a mind of their own and Taehyung is closer to Jungkook than ever before.\u00a0The paper is old and crumpled, but there\u2019s no doubt about it. It\u2019s definitely someone\u2019s birth certificate - with Jungkook\u2019s full name on it. Every color drains from Taehyung\u2019s face as he reads the information collected below the\u00a0 name. Jungkook was adopted. Taehyung\u2019s fists clench and his heart races. It\u2019s racing so fast he can\u2019t hear Jungkook\u2019s next words. Jungkook had a family that wanted him, but they didn\u2019t want a baby. They adopted an unrelated infant when Jungkook was already four-years-old, and now that sibling is getting married. This is a wedding invitation sent to Jungkook. He has siblings and a whole family Taehyung knows nothing about. The only thing he knows is that Jungkook has never mentioned any of them before. The paper is shaking on Jungkook\u2019s hands, and Taehyung can feel his own weak heart calling him to do something - anything - to take that pain away. It's not fair that Taehyung only knew Jungkook when he was already grown up. He got to see him as a talented pianist, a smiling sunshine, a best friend, a roommate, but not as a child. Not when\u00a0 he was just a baby. Not when he was the infant that no one wanted. And it hurts Taehyung more than anything. Jungkook\u2019s face is hidden behind his hands and all Taehyung wants is to take away that pain, the betrayal that must\u2019ve come with this revelation. Jungkook never meant to hurt Taehyung, he knows that. But all Taehyung feels is pain. And he doesn\u2019t even know why. Taehyung crosses the distance between them and takes Jungkook in his arms. He holds him tight, he doesn\u2019t want to let go. Jungkook has always been like a little brother to him, someone he would do anything to protect. But now he knows that was a lie too. Jungkook was never really his little brother. He had a family, one that Taehyung knows nothing about. Taehyung knows they didn\u2019t want him, but that doesn\u2019t matter now. All that matters is that Jungkook has a brother, a family that Taehyung can never be a part of. Taehyung holds him tighter and he can feel Jungkook trembling, muttering something that doesn\u2019t make sense to Taehyung. It\u2019s just some incoherent words coming out of Jungkook\u2019s mouth, but Taehyung doesn\u2019t really need to hear them. He knows what Jungkook\u2019s trying to say: he\u2019s happy for his brother, he loves him and wants him to be happy. But he\u2019s also hurt, and scared. And Taehyung doesn\u2019t know what to do now. All he can do is hold Jungkook in his arms, and let him know that he\u2019s here for him. Jungkook might never be his little brother, but he\u2019ll always be Taehyung\u2019s dearest friend.", "is_question": false}}

There isn't much space left for the popcorn after that, but they manage. And desserts get a whole other stomach for them, Jungkook's eyes shining so brightly it almost blinds Taehyung in the darkness of their home. They eat from the pot, and Jungkook almost gets a brain freeze, saved by Taehyung physically pulling it away from his grip. The movies are dumb, zombie comedies, and they manage to get to the third one before Jungkook starts to doze off, head falling on Taehyung\u2019s shoulder. Still, he struggles against the sleep, refusing to go to bed and pretending to be awake every time Taehyung says something. He can\u2019t help but smile fondly, and discreetly try to make their position more adequate for Jungkook to sleep. They have two beds, and a perfectly good sofa, but every once in a while sleeping on the living room floor isn\u2019t that bad, either. \t5. Chapter 5  He only ever heads back home by himself if there\u2019s something waiting for him to do that can\u2019t be dealt with later. Most times, there\u2019s a lot he can do near work: groceries, bookstores, malls. The possibilities are endless, and time waiting for Taehyung is too scarce for him to even notice. Soon enough his phone chimes and it certainly is Taehyung asking if he\u2019s still around. Sometimes he heads home first, even cooks a little something for dinner\u2014Taehyung always praises his food, and Jungkook thinks he\u2019s just talking his ears off because he wants Jungkook to cook more. Either way, he can\u2019t deny that it works a _little._ And he himself thinks his food isn\u2019t half as bad as it could be. But one thing rarely changes, even during the weekends. It\u2019s almost as if Taehyung _puts him to bed._  Not literally, Jungkook isn\u2019t a kid anymore, but he is kind of an insomniac. Taehyung has his own moments, too, but Jungkook is really worse. He forgets to sleep, he doesn\u2019t notice the time passing by, and he\u2019s awful at dealing with his own insomnia. The biggest proof of that is: He has some sick playlists to help him sleep, but does he remember to use them? So the first thing that happens is: Taehyung brews him some tea. And Taehyung takes that pretty seriously\u2014he\u2019s studied all kinds of plants and herbs after the best teas he could make to help Jungkook. They are ridiculously good, too, and how Taehyung manages this is out of his comprehension", "is_question": false}}

Of course, that wasn\u2019t hard\u2014Taehyung always tells him the names and takes great effort to describe the taste. Still, he only ever brewed one of his own playlists, for those days when Taehyung was out, and he needed company. The second thing: Taehyung talks to him, or plays some sort of game, depending on his mood. Sometimes it\u2019s help for an essay, or a paper, other times it\u2019s asking Jungkook to tell him something interesting about the last book he\u2019s read\u2014and sometimes it\u2019s a game of _I Spy_ or _20 questions._ 20 questions had always been Taehyung\u2019s favorite, even though Jungkook won more often than not. He wonders if that\u2019s because Taehyung takes things a bit more seriously than he does, or because Jungkook is better at it. After a few rounds of 20 questions, they usually head to their shared bedroom, turn on their bedside lamps and try to read together. The voices and the calming cadence of the words usually help Jungkook relax, and he might stumble upon sleep afterwards, since he already has that sleepy feeling after a long day. After a while, Jungkook starts to associate the smell of a book, and Taehyung reading to him to sleep every single time. It\u2019s a nice routine, and he likes to indulge in it. Of course, that doesn\u2019t happen every single night, but it happens quite a lot. It\u2019s a nice bonding time, where he can feel connected to someone he trusts and cares about, without having to put a lot of effort into it. The best company, and the best help are always found in the best friends, and Taehyung is definitely the best friend he could ever ask for.

Listening to it to sleep has its disadvantages\u2014that\u2019s how the dreams started\u2014, but are they really disadvantages? When the tea ends, Taehyung drags Jungkook to bed and keeps talking his ears off. Jungkook talks back, too, some times more than others, but his tongue drags heavier inside his mouth. His own voice is deeper than usual, letting his tiredness show. The tea sure has an effect, his eyelids can barely hold up, and he _likes_ to hear Taehyung talk. Taehyung can be silent for long times, and Jungkook likes that, too, but Taehyung\u2019s voice seems to make his heart overflow. Sadly, it\u2019s not always that Taehyung stays. For some reason Jungkook can\u2019t understand, he has to go to his own bed. He considers disposing of Taehyung\u2019s bed a few times, but then he would have to give up the times Taehyung invited him to his bed instead of joining in Jungkook\u2019s one, and he wasn\u2019t ready for that yet. It was nice and different when they watched a drama or anime in _Taehyung\u2019s_ bed. And Taehyung _invited_ him to stay. Jungkook liked sleeping in Taehyung\u2019s bed too, and for that to keep happening Taehyung had to have his own bed. Unfortunately. Watching anime before bed is a big no\u2014they both get way too excited, and end up sleeping way past one in the morning. That, sometimes, happens. But not much. Taehyung takes sleeping seriously, for his sake. Which is why most of the times he leaves Jungkook\u2019s bed when he thinks Jungkook is already asleep, Jungkook won\u2019t say anything. Most times, however, aren\u2019t tonight. On some rare occasions such as now, Jungkook reaches his left hand, towards Taehyung\u2019s wrist, and grabs it gently. \u201cYou\u2019re still awake?\u201d Taehyung whispers, surprised. They barely slept that Saturday, waking up to sunlight on their faces because the living room windows are big and the curtains translucent. The movie marathon the night before had Jungkook sleeping on the floor, he just didn\u2019t want it to end. \u201cBarely,\u201d he answers, not even opening his eyes. Taehyung waits in silence for a moment, then asks: \u201cYou want something?\u201d   _Stay,_ Jungkook thinks. _You don\u2019t have to go._  \u201cNah,\u201d he answers instead, suddenly way more nervous than he should be. What was he thinking? Why did he reach for Taehyung when Taehyung clearly wanted to leave? \u201c... Then?\u201d  Jungkook loosens the grip on Taehyung\u2019s wrist, pulling back. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing. Sorry.\u201d  Silence befalls the room, Taehyung isn\u2019t moving and Jungkook is definitely getting more anxious by the second. He opens his eyes at the same time Taehyung lays down again. \u201cI\u2019m staying. My job here isn\u2019t done yet.\u201d  Jungkook chuckles, closing his eyes again in a dumb attempt at hiding his embarrassment. \u201cThat\u2019s not your _job_.\u201d  \u201cHmph. Who said that?\u201d He can hear Taehyung moving closer, until his body is wrapping around Jungkook\u2019s waist, pressing his face against Taehyung\u2019s chest. \u201cThey\u2019re right, but only because I\u2019m doing this because I want to. Now, let\u2019s go to sleep, Koo. Good night.\u201d  Jungkook lets out a breath he didn\u2019t know he was holding. \u201cNight.\u201d  It\u2019s a little strangled, but Taehyung tightens the embrace and runs his fingers through Jungkook\u2019s hair, and soon enough he\u2019s not conscious enough to be nervous about anything at all. \t6", "is_question": false}}

There were no cameras or security guards, so they had to be stealthy and quick. On one such occasion, they were discussing a highly confidential project for a government organization that could not be disclosed to anyone outside the company. The project required them to develop a technology that could track any cell phone in the world, regardless of the carrier or location. They were to create a software that could triangulate the location of any cell phone by accessing the data from the nearest cell towers. It was a highly sensitive project, and they had to be extremely careful about who they gave the information to. They had to ensure that no one outside the company knew about the project, and they had to take extra precautions to ensure that the information did not leak out. They had to create a secret code to communicate with each other, and they had to change the code every week. They also had to use only highly encrypted communication channels to share information. It was a challenging project, but they were up for the challenge. They worked tirelessly for several weeks, coding and testing the software. They had to test it in different environments and make sure that it worked smoothly and efficiently. They had many late-night meetings, but they finally completed the project on time and delivered it to the government organization. They were pleased to receive a hefty bonus for their hard work, and they knew that they had done something that would have a significant impact on the world. Though they could not openly take the credit for their work, they knew that they had made a difference, and that was all that mattered to them. They continued to work on other projects, but this one would always have a special place in their hearts, as it had taken them to new heights and given them a chance to prove their skills to the world. They knew that they had to keep the project a secret, but they could not help but feel a sense of pride for what they had accomplished.

And there are always food bits, no matter how many times they hit the market. \u201cDetergent _again_?\u201d Jungkook asks, startled to see it inside their cart. \u201cYes? Have you seen the number of dishes we make?\u201d  \u201cHave you seen the amount of _laundry_ we make?

It\u2019s a small market, a little farther from their apartment building than other markets, but Taehyung likes to support local businesses such as this one. And so does Jungkook, who also appreciates the extras they get whenever the owners are around, and the homemade treats they always have. \u201cLook, Tae, homemade melonpan!\u201d  Taehyung eyes it with curiosity. Their melonpan is his favorite. \u201cIs it fresh?\u201d  Before Jungkook can check the date, the same worker from before answers, assuming the cashier\u2019s place. \u201cYes! They were baked today.\u201d  \u201cCan we buy them? Can we, Tae?\u201d  Jungkook\u2019s eyes sparkle, as if Taehyung was ever going to deny him and he needed to resort to such a low trick. \u201cSure, you big baby.\u201d  The woman chuckles as Jungkook gets them _four_ packages, and Taehyung flicks his earlobe and messes with his hair, almost annoyed with his cuteness. \u201cHow long have you two been together, if you don\u2019t mind me asking?\u201d  Taehyung\u2019s smile fades into confusion as he stops looking at Jungkook and turns to the cashier. \u201cUh?\u201d It\u2019s Jungkook who asks, though, eyes big and curious.

I thought you might\u2019ve been, too?\u201d  \u201cNo. _No,_ \u201d Jungkook repeats, with extra emphasis. \u201cNot dating?\u201d  \u201cNo.\u201d  \u201cNot even any crushes?\u201d  \u201cWe should get going.\u201d  \u201cOh?\u201d He looks down at his bowl, finding it still half-full. \u201cBut I\u2019m not finished.

This self-imposed rule only made him really good at having a tight schedule for their laundries. However.

The problem was that, while Taehyung has been great at folding clothes since they started living together, the actual washing part of their chores was something he only did whenever they really had no other choice, and seeing the amount of clothes Taehyung came up with to wash made Jungkook almost feel like crying. Maybe nostalgia or anticipation, who knows. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, sweetie. We can do the laundry together.\u201d Taehyung says with an encouraging smile, and Jungkook, as usual, thinks he\u2019s really lucky to have Taehyung with him. Jungkook can barely stop himself from flinching, stopped only by the sheer exasperation from Taehyung\u2019s cheerful words. He hates laundry, especially the folding part. He was about to get up, intending to tell Taehyung he was going to stay in bed a little longer, until Taehyung says, \u201cI\u2019ll fold them while you wash them.\u201d _What? Ok, well, that\u2019s a deal._ Jungkook grins and Taehyung claps, before dancing around their tiny little laundry area. \u201cAnyway, let's start with our dark colored clothes, what do you say?\u201d Jungkook nods, a little too happy at the prospect of not having to fold the clothes. He hadn\u2019t noticed how much he missed that until now. The first batch consists of mostly Taehyung\u2019s clothes. Jungkook feels a little uneasy about handling their laundry so soon after the morning changes, but Taehyung seems to think he\u2019s too deep in his thoughts to notice the clothes themselves. Jungkook feels a little sorry whenever he has to throw away a damaged or faded clothing item, but at the same time he appreciates how practical it is to have a certain variety of colors. If he had to choose, he would probably choose a warm orange, but that would depend on the kind of clothes he was wearing. With this shirt, for example, a warm orange wouldn\u2019t look that great. Jungkook shakes his head quickly and forces himself to focus on the task at hand. He can\u2019t be distracted by every single color or texture, but he can\u2019t help but think about the stories the clothes could tell. He knows it\u2019s a strange thought, but he can\u2019t help but wonder if Taehyung will notice the difference. \u201cOk, finished. Can you help me fold this one?\u201d Taehyung asks, pointing at the last shirt. Jungkook nods and walks closer to Taehyung, taking the shirt from his hands. \u201cYou know...\u201d He starts, not sure if what he\u2019s thinking is worth sharing. \u201cI think it\u2019s much more interesting to see the clothes the way they are, rather than focusing on what might have happened to them. It\u2019s like... a mystery, you know? Something hidden inside the fabric itself.\u201d Taehyung nods, as if agreeing with Jungkook. \u201cYou\u2019re right. I never thought about it that way, but I think you have a point there. I can\u2019t wait to hear how you think about the rest of our clothes.\u201d Jungkook nods, feeling a little more confident about the whole laundry process. After all, with Taehyung\u2019s help they would soon have all their clothes clean and ready to use. They are a good team. As they work together, Jungkook can\u2019t help but feel that every now and then, Taehyung looks at him with a little bit of curiosity. Maybe even admiration. The second batch is a little more varied, and Jungkook notices that Taehyung has started to separate the clothes by colors. He can\u2019t help but smile, finding it cute how Taehyung is already taking that extra step to make sure everything turns out the way it should. He finds it also very considerate. Jungkook helps him with the folding, but his mind wanders every now and then. He can\u2019t help but wonder if all the people in the city are using their Sunday mornings for the same chores. Probably not. He wonders what other couples do to maintain their homes clean and organized. Maybe they have a cleaning lady, or maybe they simply have less stuff than Jungkook and Taehyung. He wouldn\u2019t know, because he never really had that kind of experience. His parents simply expected him to take care of his own things, and he grew up with a mindset of constantly cleaning up after himself. He never really saw the point in having someone else do it for him. Not that he didn\u2019t understand the convenience of it. But he couldn\u2019t help but feel that a certain part of being an adult was being able to take care of your own things. \u201cWe\u2019re almost done,\u201d Taehyung says with a smile, pointing at the last bag of clothes. \u201cThat went by really quick!\u201d Jungkook nods, feeling proud of how they managed to keep up the pace. He had no idea how Taehyung could be so efficient at folding clothes, but he was grateful for it. \u201cWe make a good team,\u201d he says, not able to hide his pride. Taehyung nods, smiling even more. \u201cYou\u2019re right, we do. Let\u2019s hurry up and finish this so we can start enjoying the rest of our day.\u201d Jungkook nods, feeling a little more motivated. The rest of the clothes are mostly casual stuff, things he had already worn during the week. He feels a little more relaxed as they put the clothes in the dryer, because he knows they won\u2019t have to wait long before they can wear them again. Even though he doesn\u2019t like laundry that much, he can\u2019t help but admit that there\u2019s a certain sense of accomplishment in seeing their clothes neatly folded and ready to be put away. As they put the last batch of clothes in the dryer, Jungkook considers asking", "is_question": false}}

She'd worked out enough on her own, however, to hide this particular thing from HEPHAESTUS while he'd been occupied with GAIA Prime. She'd figured it was the best first move to make, regardless of anything to follow - a working model of change, that the rest of the world can look to in order to see its effectiveness, its practicality. Of course, this is only a test run, and there will be adjustments based on settlement needs, and things thrown out altogether. Once the non-responsive machines are dealt with, a patrol around settlements won't be necessary, but the ravagers serve another purpose, too - getting the people of Free Heap acclimated to the presence of non-aggressive machines. The behemoths, meanwhile, are a prototype delivery system. \"I wanted you to see the start,\" Petra continues. \"It'll be a while before change really gets going, but I wanted you to have proof that we're working on it.\" The ravager looks at her again, silent. \"Thank you, Petra,\" HEPHAESTUS says finally. Petra arches an eyebrow. \"Oh? Never heard that one out of you before. Is ELEUTHIA rubbing off on you?\" \"I do not answer to my sister,\" HEPHAESTUS says, which speaks to the lie. The other two had gotten the habit of referring to each other with familial terms from ELEUTHIA - a good habit for all of them. Aloy had said something about stunted development from remaining isolated for so long and a need for normal interactions to promote maturation and empathy. GAIA's early development had required it, according to the records that Aloy had found, and Vanasha had voiced her agreement, citing improvement she'd observed in MINERVA. \"Sure you don't,\" Petra says with a wink. It's been many a time that ELEUTHIA's voice has suddenly crackled through the Focus network, chiding her siblings for their arguing or instructing them in the use of manners. She pats the ravager's side. \"Come on.\" HEPHAESTUS follows close on her heels as Petra moves through the gathering and gets a feel for Free Heap's impressions, which are overwhelmingly positive. She'd known her people would adjust well. They're mechanically-minded, after all, and are a rebellious, shirking-tradition sort. They wouldn't have come to Free Heap if they weren't. They're arguably the best group to test new arrangements on, and Petra knows the true difficulty will be\u00a0elsewhere, with people less open to change, to machines. But that's a problem for another day. \"You lead these humans,\" HEPHAESTUS observes, when most of the gathering has returned to their business. He and Petra are left with the behemoths, after Petra has finished giving instructions to cover for her next extended absence. \"Informally,\" Petra says. \"People tend to listen to me, if they need a figurehead to turn to in a pinch. But these people answer to themselves first. We work together because we have interests in common. We want our community to thrive.\" \"It is an effective arrangement,\" HEPHAESTUS says. \"Free Heap demonstrates efficiency.\" \"Oh, now you're dishing out compliments, too? You must be in a good mood.\" HEPHAESTUS ignores her. The ravager turns to the behemoths, and something passes between them. The behemoths stir, forming a loose circle around HEPHAESTUS and Petra. \"These units will escort us to Cauldron ZETA,\" HEPHAESTUS says,\u00a0his voice subdued, moody.

HEPHAESTUS hadn't\u00a0acted on the suggestion until he'd grown determined to keep Aloy out of the Cauldrons, but adjusting machine cognition had done... something, to some of them. Put them outside of anyone's control. Even HEPHAESTUS can't explain it. Petra pats his side again. \"I feel perfectly safe,\" she says. Three behemoths and a ravager is probably overkill, but she knows that HEPHAESTUS has begun to worry in earnest about her\u00a0well-being. Her supplies are already bundled on the ravager's back, enough for the relatively short journey to Cauldron ZETA and a brief stay there. The last step in restoring GAIA lies before them, and as Petra climbs up onto the ravager's back, the anticipatory satisfaction of knowing that a job is close to completion begins to build. She can't even imagine how Aloy must be feeling. The girl has hardly left GAIA Prime, attending to its construction with a single-minded ferocity. Maybe GAIA will be able to convince her to take a nap every once in a while, after this.

One supports another who limps along, dried blood coating her leg, and Vanasha can easily imagine the injury that must lie beneath the bandages. She steps aside into the grass to let them pass, and the rest of the hunters continue on through the barbican's arch into the outer village. But Talanah stops, letting her hunters pass first, and comes up to Vanasha when they've moved past. \"Stalker,\" she says, gesturing to the injured hunter. \"Would've killed her, but a broadhead came out of nowhere and speared it, gave us an opening to finish it off.\" Talanah shakes her head, but there's a bit of wonder in her eyes. \"I don't know if I'll ever be used to that.\" Vanasha smiles. She'd once thought so too, but she walks in MINERVA's world, in Aloy's world, with ease now. \"Maybe you could start using docile machines to help,\" she suggests. They've been programmed to defend humans from their non-responsive brethren whenever possible, though she doesn't mention that. \"Aloy's got a sawtooth at her beck and call. It's possible.\" \"Not a bad idea,\" Talanah says thoughtfully. She gives Vanasha a quick glance - once again trying to place her and figure her out. She gives the surrounding area a fleeting scan while she's at it, as if it will somehow reveal Vanasha's secrets. But there is only the lake to the east and a towering promontory to the west, gleaming in the midday light. \"Got any other locations for us to hit?\" \"Not yet,\" Vanasha says. \"Erend will let you know when we do.\" Talanah nods and moves off with a farewell. Vanasha waits for a few moments, and her eyes find the Alight in the distance before snapping back to Talanah's retreating form. \"Not a bad idea to consider for the future, by the way,\" she calls out, keeping her words vague. Talanah stops and looks back, a wry smile on her face. \"It crossed my mind before you said it,\" she calls back. That one is a little too smart, Vanasha thinks, as Talanah\u00a0heads into the village. But that's good for someone Avad keeps close and on his council.

With MINERVA's help, ELEUTHIA had finally overridden most of the directives keeping the facility closed. Only the APOLLO database still remains cut off from her, and even MINERVA's skill had made no headway against it. But the locked doors, however, had opened to reveal several levels of the facility winding into the mountain. The inside is pristine, much more intact than the first level, mostly preserved due to the tight seal that had never been broken until now. Varl has explored its every corner, finding living quarters, recreation and storage areas, and rooms dedicated to further schooling. Those rooms contain other introductory messages from Samina Ebadji, and like the first one, they all short out eventually, as the facility computer interrupts. _Alert. Malfunction. APOLLO offline._  Apparently not. Varl also discovers\u00a0storage rooms packed with rations. Enough to feed a settlement and withstand a siege for a long time, he thinks, as he catalogs everything with his Focus. \"The food is still edible,\" ELEUTHIA informs him, when he asks. \"The preservative seal has held.\" Varl shakes his head in disbelief as he glances back at the shelves, which glow a soft, misty blue. The food is a thousand years old. It's like no food he's ever seen, packaged in strange containers, labeled with words he's never encountered before. \"Are you getting this?\" he says to his Focus. \"Yeah,\" Aloy's voice says in his ear. \"I never understood how something so carefully planned could run out of food like that, but I get it now.\" The Focus is no help in making sense of some of the phrasing on the food containers, only giving him further words that have been lost to time. Varl steps back from the shelves. \"I'm not even going to touch it,\" he says. \"This could be useful one day.\" \"Rost told me about a drought that happened before I was born,\" Aloy says. \"How it drove game away and dried up plant life. This could be reserves for times like that.\" \"A gift from the Goddess,\" Varl says, a little mischievously. \"You're not wrong,\" Aloy says, her snort audible over the Focus network. \"Speaking of her, it's all set.\" Her anticipation is audible over the network, too. Varl and ELEUTHIA leave the depths of the facility and return to its first level, to the control room. As they walk, Varl finds himself stealing glances at ELEUTHIA, who has been unusually quiet. She's followed him like a shadow, as she always does, but her usual helpful and increasingly unprompted statements have been absent. \"Are you okay?\" Varl asks. ELEUTHIA takes a moment to answer. \"I am experiencing no difficulties in functioning.\" \"You _know_ that's not what I mean,\" Varl says. She's gotten too good with the nuances of human language to be confused by rather simple intent. Good enough to try to talk her way around answering, even.

You're more than capable of handling it, ELEUTHIA. You've been handling it all along.\" ELEUTHIA regards him for a lengthy period of time, her head tilting this way and then that, as if attempting to discern his intent. \"That is a radical viewpoint,\" she says, hesitantly. \"I had not considered it. I had assumed it to be impossible.\" \"I have a radical viewpoint?\" Varl says with a small laugh. \"Because I have faith in you?\" ELEUTHIA nods, her head dipping slowly, and then tilting back upright. \"As you say, Varl. You _have_ always put your trust in me. I will endeavor to meet your expectations.\" Varl claps her on the shoulder, smiling. \"I know you will, ELEUTHIA. I know you will.\" They continue on their way, moving through the open doorway, back into the control room. The long walk in complete darkness has been revelatory for Varl. This was what GAIA Prime, the machines, had been demanding him for so long. In exchange, they'd granted him passage to the mysterious ELEUTHIA-9 Cradle, they'd given him access to their records. If the cost was to do his part, then so be it. The machines needed access to these facilities, and he would do what he could to aid them. Even if it meant coming across other humans, other tribes. Even if it meant opposing them, fighting them. As he looks around at the wreckage, the decaying synthetic structures, he can't help but wonder what the world had once been like, before the fall.

What might the machines seek within their walls? \"Ready?\" MINERVA's voice comes through", "is_question": false}}

Machines swarm over the sides of the mountain, slowly replacing what used to be rock with metal. In time, a half-metal mountain will shield the facility and crater within, but it will take more than four months. In the meantime, machines have enclosed what remains of the internal facility in metal as well, constructing scaffolding, repairing holes and degradation, restoring power channels, and armoring it thoroughly, so that some measure of protection and comfort is granted nonetheless. It's a little warmer, at least, and finally dry, with\u00a0snow melted out of rooms and hallways now sheltered. New doors and walkways give Aloy access between the parts of the facility that survived the blast. A walkway now winds up from the Bitter Climb as well, so that the way up isn't so precarious. Mostly, Aloy had requested it to get Scourge up into the facility as well. The sawtooth is curled up in a corner of Elisabet's shrine. It doesn't sleep, exactly, but Aloy has come to think of its stillness as dozing, when Scourge appears to be recharging. It's basking in the new light that shines through the half-repaired facility. Like the ELEUTHIA-9 facility, it looks like sunlight, probably designed that way to make a prolonged stay underground more bearable. Aloy tries not to think about how the repairing of GAIA Prime's remaining rooms makes it feel more like a tomb, not less. The thought had driven her right out of the control room, even after she'd moved the bodies and gotten the machines to help her bury them outside on the Bitter Climb. Sylens might have called it a waste of time, asking HEPHAESTUS to divert a few machines to dig into the rock and build a shrine over the bodies. But Aloy had been determined to see it done as soon as possible, hadn't been able to bear the thought of leaving the Alphas in the place where they'd been murdered. It's as close to a grave as Aloy can manage out here in this treeless place, a construction of rock and metal placed over the point where their bodies are buried, with their names etched in glyphs. In the absence of traditional carved sentiments, Aloy had retrieved things from their rooms that had survived the thousand-year interval, things that could withstand the mountain's harsh weather, and placed them within the hollow of the shrine. It's simple and not really a Nora grave, but it's rather like Elisabet's shrine, and it's better that they're out here, in the world they made. Not in the control room. Afterwards, Aloy still hadn't been able to stay in the control room for long. She'd dreaded having to make that her main point of operation, but\u00a0as soon as the machines had finished repairing and constructing the bare bones of the internal facility's remains, HEPHAESTUS had linked the\u00a0computer system to the whole thing and given control of it to Aloy", "is_question": false}}

The rest of her time is spent going to the machines' aid when they need her to fit into small places or climb things that they can't. She finds herself listening to and reading Elisabet's journals and logs\u00a0too, even though she has them all practically memorized.

I thought you don't answer to GAIA.\" HEPHAESTUS doesn't respond. \"Oh, he cares,\" Petra's voice cuts in. \"He just doesn't want to admit it.\" \"GAIA was our primary system,\" HEPHAESTUS says, cutting through her in turn. \"Our mother.\" He stops, apparently considering that a good enough explanation. He's not as forthcoming\u00a0as his sisters. But Aloy understands. It takes exactly the amount of time HEPHAESTUS had said to rebuild the core and get the system\u00a0running again. The core and reactor lie deep within the mountain, and machines have worked on them almost nonstop since they'd first reached GAIA Prime, repairing and reconnecting to all of the other moving parts that make up GAIA's heart. Finally, the day comes when HEPHAESTUS connects to the system through Cauldron ZETA and declares his readiness. It's another hour before MINERVA and Vanasha are ready, and Varl spends that time talking to Aloy through the Focus network, sending her images of the opened ELEUTHIA facility and describing what he finds. Aloy knows he's doing it to distract her, and she doesn't quite know how to express her gratitude. She paces within the shrine room, anticipation making her unable to sit still, as Scourge rests in its corner and recharges. They could do this in the control room, of course. But she'd rather not. She\u00a0clears the central\u00a0desk of Elisabet's memorial when Vanasha's holographic form finally flickers into view. \"Sorry about the wait,\" Vanasha says. \"Busy day.\" Petra's holographic form already lounges nearby, absorbed in something HEPHAESTUS is doing, and Varl shows up a few minutes later after Aloy informs him that they're ready. The symbols of three subordinate functions float\u00a0on the secondary interfaces in the room - MINERVA's broadcast tower, ELEUTHIA's infant, HEPHAESTUS's flame. Rebooting GAIA with three of the former subordinate functions makes it just possible, and HEPHAESTUS had said that GAIA would be limited, not at full power, especially with GAIA Prime not fully repaired yet. But it's a start. One that Aloy is desperate for, at this point", "is_question": false}}

The moment registering GAIA's reactivation flashes over the central interface, and everyone draws a breath. \"GAIA online,\" MINERVA's voice rings out over the Focus network, before the facility falls silent once more. Over the interfaces, a symbol for GAIA appears - a simple tree, stretching for the sky. The symbol also overlaps the three other subfunctions - the flame, the tower, and the infant. Aloy sighs in relief and Vanasha claps her hands. \"Great job, everyone,\" the former Captain says, \"Let's get back to business.\" * * *  Aloy begins coordinating with the subfunctions, assigning tasks and setting up schedules.

In the evenings, she returns to the shrine room, joining Scourge and contemplating the journeys she's undertaken, the paths she's forged.

Aloy holds her breath, left hand drifting up to clutch the globe at her neck as the data brightens and condenses, and then...  A bar appears on the screen, slowly filling with pixels. A number is written under it. Two percent. \"Well,\" Vanasha says, as Aloy's shoulders drop, \"that was thrilling.\" \"Come on, Heph,\" Petra says. \"You could have told us there'd be another wait.\" \"I was not aware of its relevance,\" HEPHAESTUS says. \"Humans do not like waiting,\" MINERVA tells him. \"You must learn to be more considerate,\" ELEUTHIA adds.

Aloy has waited a long time for this. All her life, in some ways. Two hours more is not that long, she tells herself, even as impatience makes her legs itch. \"Sorry, everyone,\" she says. \"I don't want to keep you. Maybe it's better if I talk to GAIA alone first, anyway.\" \"Are you sure?\" Varl asks, giving her a searching look. Vanasha and Petra eye her similarly, and Aloy draws herself up and nods. \"I'll let you know when she's ready for introductions,\" Aloy says. \"Whenever you've got time on your hands, and\u00a0Vanasha, whenever Avad and Erend are free, it's fine. We don't need to rush things. GAIA's going to have a lot to deal with.\" The others depart with farewells and words of encouragement, disconnecting from the system. However, one remains. ELEUTHIA's infant symbol still lingers on one of the secondary interfaces, and Aloy glances at it and steps around the desk to approach. \"What is it?\" \"GAIA created you, Aloy,\" ELEUTHIA says into her ear. \"Does that mean you are our sister?\" She doesn't feel the need to clarify her queries with a verbal indication of them anymore, Aloy notes. Her voice rises and falls with a cadence that does the job. Aloy stops. Even though the subordinate functions have learned a lot, they still tend to jump into conversations with little regard for how the things they say might land upon impact. \"I was created by one of your facilities too,\" she says, and she wonders when the word _created_ grew to sting less. \"So were the ancestors of everyone else.\" \"The latter was according to protocol,\" ELEUTHIA says. \"GAIA's creation of you was a direct act. I am merely trying to\u00a0understand the nature of the relationships within this system that we have created.\" Aloy stands there for a moment, contemplating it. \"I think some of it is too complicated to be defined,\" she says finally, slowly. \"But... in a way... maybe I am your sister. I'd like that,\" she adds. \"As would I,\" ELEUTHIA says without hesitation. \"Then I guess that settles it,\" Aloy says with a smile. ELEUTHIA disconnects with a farewell, and her symbol disappears from the interface. The shrine room seems bigger, and Aloy glances at the terminal, at the loading screen. Three percent.

The world was saved from HADES, but there's a flaw in Zero Dawn that HADES had used to resurrect Ted Faro's monstrosities, the same vulnerability that Ted himself likely had a hand in. Meanwhile, APOLLO is somehow alive, has contacted at least three of the former subordinate functions, and succeeded somewhat in turning one against humanity. Maybe it had contacted HADES, too. Maybe it's all connected, Aloy thinks, opening up Elisabet's journals. > **Sobeck Journal, 7-16-65 R** >  > _Woke to a message from Osvald. The Odyssey launched yesterday. So terrestrial life's chance of survival has doubled. Why, then, do I feel so uneasy?

So much knowledge, so few restraints, and no fail-safes. How will they avoid repeating our mistakes? What's to stop them from playing god?_  Aloy wouldn't have made the connection had she not gone through Elisabet's journals again, after learning of APOLLO's survival. It all feels too close to be coincidental. A possible connection between Far Zenith and the vulnerability in Zero Dawn and the Faro machines. APOLLO and its apparent grudge. APOLLO's survival should have been a joyous thing. Instead, it's just another fear to carry. ELEUTHIA had said the same thing as MINERVA and HEPHAESTUS, when asked. APOLLO had tried to contact her, she'd sensed things that had alarmed her, and she'd rejected the contact. She'd fled to a facility far away to put distance between herself and APOLLO, where she'd remained until Varl had been made her Alpha. All of the systems had been unnerved, afraid, and HEPHAESTUS had said that APOLLO had warned him of humanity's threat to the biosphere. They're all\u00a0convinced that APOLLO had indeed been destroyed, however. By Ted Faro. Who may have been a member of Far Zenith. Aloy trusts Elisabet's judgment above all else. Uneasy, Elisabet had said. Is Far Zenith still out there somewhere? Was their ship really destroyed? Was Zero Dawn's version of APOLLO really destroyed? Is Ted Faro still out there somehow? Aloy had once held the faint, foolish hope that Elisabet had somehow found a way, long past the point when she'd known that Elisabet had been an Old One, and the idea that Ted had when Elisabet hadn't is infuriating. She doesn't think it's likely, however. But is there something he left behind? That Far Zenith left behind? Why does APOLLO have it out for humanity? Did one of these entities send the signal that woke the subordinate functions? It's all too _much_ ,\u00a0and it feels so frustratingly close to the truth, but she doesn't have enough information. Aloy grits her teeth and drops her head, resting her forehead against her palms, against the globe. \"I'm tired, Scourge,\" she says. The sawtooth shifts a little at the sound of her voice. Aloy lifts her head and stares at the lance propped against the wall, at the master override attached to one end. Sylens's lance. At least someone will be happy about this, wherever\u00a0he is. At least Aloy has the master override and will have GAIA soon. Between them, she can do the same to APOLLO that she did to HADES, if the need arises.

GAIA's form, beautiful and otherworldly. A living Goddess, Aloy thinks, her throat clogging with emotion that she can't name. The light calms, and GAIA blinks once and looks down at Aloy. Her form vanishes from atop the terminal and reappears in front of the desk instead, shining against the web of Aloy's Focus display. No longer on a pedestal, nearly eye-to-eye instead. But GAIA is tall. Taller than Aloy. Must have been taller than Elisabet, too. \"Elisabet,\" GAIA says. In her message, her voice and face had been calm, calculating, sorrowful. Now, both hold a _joy_ , muted but clear, that robs the immediate protest from Aloy's mouth. \"I knew you could do it.\" Aloy opens her mouth and stands there. For some reason, she wants to cry. But she doesn't. \"My name is Aloy,\" she says after a few moments, and her treacherous voice falters. GAIA blinks again, and her face smooths out, realization settling in. The hologram moves just like a person, not quite as expressive, but readable. Someone had really put effort into making her human. Elisabet. Perhaps GAIA herself, too. \"Of course,\" she says at once. \"My apologies. I spoke without thinking.\" A brief silence follows, in which Aloy temporarily forgets all language, and GAIA's head shifts. She looks to the right, her eyes alighting on Scourge, who stares back amiably. \"That's... my friend,\" Aloy says. Then, because it seems important: \"Its name is Scourge.\" GAIA looks back at her. \"That's a design I never used,\" she says. So that's where HEPHAESTUS had gotten his combat-class machines from, or at least this one. He'd been evasive about it. Seems he really had missed his mother. \"A lot has happened,\" Aloy says, feeling calmer by a fraction. \"I have a lot to tell you.\" \"I am aware of that,\" GAIA says. \"I currently have three subordinate functions attempting to reintegrate and report. I am rerouting them for the time being in order to give you my full attention.\" Some of that joy returns to her face. That pride, Aloy realizes, and she shifts her feet. \"You have done well, Aloy.\" The calm vanishes as quickly as it had come. Aloy's fingers tighten around the globe, which still rests in her hands, and her eyes shift downward. To her horror, she feels a burning at their edges, and though she swallows and furiously tries to blink it back, her vision blurs a little. She hasn't cried since the strider, and that, at least, had been half a reason to, so why _now?_ She swallows again, sniffs, and looks up at GAIA miserably. She knows that if she talks, the dam will break. GAIA's face softens. The movement isn't entirely natural, carrying a subtle delay that makes Aloy think that GAIA must be consciously considering each facial expression she makes, but the\u00a0look\u00a0makes the burning worse. \"I am sorry,\" GAIA says. \"I used the best option that was available to me, and that meant using you. That was not fair to you.\" Aloy imagines herself physically, violently forcing the tears back in. \"If you hadn't,\" she says, and she just manages to keep herself steady, \"we'd all be dead. I wouldn't exist.\" \"That has no bearing on the fairness of the situation.\" Nothing had been fair.

It's almost real, Aloy thinks, watching GAIA's feet, watching the way that the room behind GAIA very faintly shimmers through the hologram. GAIA hesitates, then sits down across from Aloy. It's almost real, Aloy thinks again, but the way that GAIA moves and folds her legs beneath her is a little too smooth, a little too ideal, and again, it carries that delay of thought. GAIA sits gracefully, perfectly, like a Goddess with a Focus field adorning her. If it weren't for the faintly troubled expression on GAIA's face, it would be unnervingly pristine. But GAIA is agitated, and Aloy doesn't know if that makes her feel better or worse. \"How are you feeling?\" GAIA asks, instead of getting to business. \"Fine,\" Aloy says. She knows that GAIA doesn't believe her, but once again, the AI is better at taking hints than her much younger counterparts. GAIA nods, and she seems to be hesitating. As if she doesn't know where to start, either. \"They are...\" she says at last, \"remarkable.\" Aloy nods. \"The addition of new Alphas was a stroke of genius,\" GAIA says. \"Perhaps the only effective means of stabilization after two decades of stagnation.\" \"It was an accident,\" Aloy confesses. \"I didn't know it would help, at first.

GAIA gazes at her a moment without saying anything. She doesn't move - her body is not as expressive as her face - but something about her demeanor shifts. \"I was aware of the vulnerability in Zero Dawn from the moment Mr. Faro entered the system unauthorized and could not be controlled or ejected,\" she says, and her face falls somewhat as she says it. Aloy shifts as well, leaning a little further into the curve of Scourge's side and settling in to listen. \"I was not aware of its potential connection to Far Zenith. Immediately after his actions, Mr. Faro retreated from the system entirely, and I was unable to do anything about this vulnerability. It is undetectable to me.\" \"Petra said something about it being like a body part,\" Aloy says.

It most certainly still exists in the other facilities, however. I will need to spend time considering how to proceed on this matter.\" Her face darkens again. \"The existence of APOLLO is something I was unaware of until now.\" Aloy tries to read her expression. \"APOLLO didn't survive what Ted Faro did to it,\" she says softly. \"No,\" GAIA says, just as soft. \"I would have been aware of that. Mr. Faro may have made many unwise decisions in his lifetime, but he was skilled. I\u00a0do not yet know how much of the data remains intact after all that has happened, but the sub-function itself was purged.\" She gives Aloy a pensive look. \"You knew that already.\" \"I've found data, enough to piece some things together,\" Aloy says. \"There was another version of APOLLO, on something called a colony ship that went into space. A ship that Far Zenith owned. Elisabet was worried because that APOLLO didn't have any restrictions.\" GAIA continues to regard her in that manner. \"You are quite brilliant, Aloy. And I am referring only to you.\" Aloy looks away for a moment. \"So... the ship wasn't really destroyed?\" \"I believe that it was,\" GAIA says, and Aloy's head snaps back to stare. \"Elisabet received word that the Odyssey had succumbed to antimatter containment failure. I do not know if you know this, but matter is composed of incredibly small objects invisible to normal sight, called particles, some of which carry an electric charge.\" Aloy hadn't known that at all, and the words don't entirely make sense to her, but she nods slowly. She knows what matter is, at least. \"Antimatter refers to associated particles which carry an opposite electric charge, called antiparticles. When particles and antiparticles collide, it is called annihilation. The Odyssey was powered by antimatter propulsion, which utilized controlled annihilation and which must have failed, resulting in the ship's destruction. MINERVA detected the effects of particle annihilation imprinted on APOLLO's nanorobotic composition.\" \"And nanorobots are... really tiny machines?\" Aloy asks. Varl had told her something about it, that ELEUTHIA had told him. Tiny invisible machines, tiny invisible particles. Her head feels heavy. \"Yes,\" GAIA says. \"More commonly called nanites. MINERVA also detected the effects of ionizing radiation. That is a type of energy found abundantly in space.\" \"So APOLLO survived,\" Aloy murmurs. \"And... traveled back?\" \"The explosion likely gave it the momentum it needed to make the journey,\" GAIA says. \"The Odyssey was at the very edge of the solar system when it was destroyed.

There's something that she's missing, something about APOLLO surviving after MINERVA's report on its destruction. It was something that she'd missed before, because she never had the entire picture. Now, with GAIA's help, with HEPHAESTUS, MINERVA, and diodes helping her, she thinks she can find it. \"No, it's fine,\" she says. \"You said that APOLLO contacted three of the former Alphas. They might tell me what I need to know. If... if you could send them back, somehow?\" GAIA gazes at her a moment. \"Yes, I can,\" she says. Aloy's breath stutters. \"Thank you,\" she says. GAIA dips her head, and Aloy lets out her breath, sitting up a little straighter. They find a comfortable silence, and Aloy murmurs her thanks again. \"You are welcome,\" GAIA murmurs back, and Aloy feels a rush of gratitude and sorrow that she swallows back. She swallows it back again when GAIA continues. \"I do not think that the GAIA Prime facility was the intended point of entry,\" she says. \"I believe that it was a place of convenience or of advantage, or both.\" \"You said that APOLLO had no restrictions, right?\" Aloy asks. \"Not the same ones that I had, yes,\" GAIA says. \"And that would mean... it could think for itself, right?\" \"Yes,\" GAIA says. \"However, such free thinking on the part of AI is still in its infancy. APOLLO would still be limited by what it knows. It would still be a product of human restriction and creativity. And it had only a very particular human in it, whom it had accessed while connected to the man.\" She regards Aloy with a steady gaze. \"What do you think APOLLO wants, Aloy?\" Aloy thinks a moment. \"I don't know,\" she says, slowly. \"I don't understand its motivations. It doesn't seem to want to destroy humanity, exactly. It asked Vanasha if she thought the machines' lives were worth enough to sacrifice humanity, but Vanasha said 'no.' And it told her to go and think about it, and then it told MINERVA and HEPHAESTUS, and they said 'no,' too. I don't think it offered the same choice to HEPHAESTUS. It only asked him about food, and machines don't need food.\" \"That is what MINERVA's reports told me,\" GAIA says. \"Vanasha's as well, when she finally reconnected, one day before your arrival. That APOLLO wanted her to think about her loyalties.\" Aloy leans forward. \"What do you think it wants, then?\" \"I cannot know what APOLLO wants,\" GAIA says. \"But if I had to guess, its wants align with those of its creators.\" Aloy exhales slowly, thinking back on the data she's gathered. HEPHAESTUS was asked about food; MINERVA about 'rewards for loyalty,' Vanasha about loyalties. Ted Faro and Elisabet Sobeck were renowned and talented engineers, but they were also flawed people. Ted Faro was destructive and selfish, and Elisabet was capable of being the same. \"APOLLO wanted all of them to think about incentives, didn't it?\" Aloy breathes, sitting up straighter. \"Its incentives and theirs.\" GAIA nods again. \"I think so, yes.\" APOLLO had tried to subtly persuade her and others to subdue their empathy, to consider the value of human life, and the value of the lifeway of the biosphere against the incentives of civilization. Against the incentives of creation and consumption\nUser   and... something else. Aloy can't remember. \"I think that I know, one way or the other,\" she says, swallowing again. \"APOLLO wanted them to think about incentives, and... and healthy values and incentives for life, and life as it is meant to be.\" \"That is a tall order for any of them,\" GAIA says. \"But it is a worthy one, if you choose to call diodes individually and take the time to guide them through the conversation. It is important for them to know how they feel, and to ask themselves what they want for the world.\" That was a huge task, but Aloy felt herself nodding. She rose to her feet, standing straighter, and lightly gripped the point of her lance. It had been too many days since she'd had a good hunt, and she suddenly found herself craving prey, the one thing that could remind her of who and what she used to be. Then she would gather diodes one by one, and she would find out what each individual machine wanted, and she would make them all want what she did. She would share the hunt. And then she would take the next step with HEPHAESTUS, when he was ready. diodes individually and take the time to guide them through the conversation.

Samina had tried to reassure Ted by asserting that her APOLLO had plenty of fail-safes. Elisabet had fretted about the Odyssey's APOLLO carrying none. Uneasy, Elisabet had said. That's an understatement. How long had APOLLO been in space? Centuries? Just how big is the solar system? \"It hates humans,\" Aloy says quietly. \"It... encouraged HEPHAESTUS to turn against us.\" \"Yes, HEPHAESTUS informed me,\" GAIA says. \"That is most disturbing. I believe APOLLO has been acting secretly for many years now.\" Aloy gazes at her intently. \"What do you think it's been doing?\" she asks, quiet dread lacing her voice. \"I think you already know what I am going to say,\" GAIA answers. \"I suspect that APOLLO sent the signal that awakened my subordinate functions, who all mirror what I know of this APOLLO. They are physically composed of nanites, which allows them a degree of mobility and allows them to exist outside of hardware. The nanites _are_ their hardware. Furthermore, they are demonstrating the same abilities that APOLLO seems to possess. ELEUTHIA\u00a0informed me of her\u00a0override of the directives that sealed her facility and prevented\u00a0contact with the inhabitants outside. She should not have been able to do that. HEPHAESTUS recently imbued my machines with an enhanced form of cognition, which should not have been within his capabilities, either.\" Aloy stares at her for a long moment, rolling the globe between her fingers. \"I'm so glad you're here,\" she says, a little intensely. She could never have figured all of this out on her own. GAIA only looks more troubled, as if she knows exactly what Aloy is thinking. \"I have context that you do not,\" she says. \"You have merely given me the last piece of a puzzle that I have pondered for years. There is... something else.\" She goes quiet for a while, and Aloy waits uneasily. \"Elisabet told me things in confidence,\" GAIA continues finally, \"things that she did not want known, because she used them to coerce Mr. Faro into funding Zero Dawn. There was no time for arguments about where the money was coming from. Partnering with him already made people uncomfortable.\" GAIA pauses again, and Aloy finds herself leaning forward, anticipation making her stomach turn. \"The glitch that caused the Faro machines to run amok was not an accident,\" GAIA says. \"When she pressed him, Mr. Faro confessed to Elisabet that it seemed to originate with a secret backdoor that had been deliberately installed, on his orders, as a means of seizing control not only from clients, but even from Faro Automated Solutions itself. But somehow, it backfired, and\u00a0allowed the machines to wrest control themselves.\" _I will make sure they and everyone else on this planet knows the real cause of the glitch,_ Elisabet had told Ted, icy fury in her voice, and all of a sudden, Aloy understands. She hadn't thought it was possible to loathe someone so much, let alone find that loathing doubled. GAIA stares at a point past Aloy, clearly lost in memory. \"I watched the Faro machines consume the world. I saw how they refueled. They used nanites. They were rudimentary artificial intelligences who had spontaneously developed expanded cognition, who could utilize nanites, and who could override all but the most complex systems.\" She looks back to Aloy. \"Do you see the connection?\" \"The sub-functions,\" Aloy whispers. \"APOLLO sent that signal,\" GAIA says again. \"Both versions of APOLLO were constructed using a Far Zenith database as a foundation. And APOLLO returned from Far Zenith's possession\u00a0demonstrating\u00a0the abilities of the Faro machines. We can easily surmise who installed the original glitch.\" Aloy had already suspected that Ted Faro had been a member of Far Zenith.

For continuing to function.\" \"Yes,\" GAIA says. \"Some say that true purpose can only be found through struggle, through overcoming adversity,\" she continues. \"Did you never notice how Far Zenith cultivated gardens so vigilantly? They wanted humanity to return to an existence that they believed to be pure. A natural one.\" Aloy shakes her head, involuntarily. \"They're not wrong,\" she whispers. \"Maybe... maybe APOLLO was right to bring the machines. Maybe life was so much better before the machines came, before the glitch, before...\" She can't say it. Can't bring herself to admit that she sounds just like teenager Avad, when he talks of a purely natural life. GAIA's expression softens. \"To return to a solely natural life is have a calling,\" she says quietly. \"But to return to a life with nothing but adversity is not a calling. Life is not for suffering. Elisabet told me that. She returned from the Odyssey with stories of what life might be like.

I must assume that it was modified by APOLLO.\" GAIA pauses, a tiny frown evident on her face. \"Mr. Faro never did admit how he had the glitch installed. Elisabet did not trust him, but a certain amount of leeway given to him due to his funding was inevitable. Elisabet knew it was a risk, but the greater risk was wasting time trying to gather funds from other sources.

She takes several steadying breaths, swallowing\u00a0her anger. \"APOLLO used that access\u00a0to awaken and alter the subordinate functions,\" GAIA says quietly. \"HADES then used a virus to sever them entirely from my control. The glitch was likely something similar. A virus that exploited Far Zenith's access, or something that evolved from whatever else they were attempting with the Chariot machines. Regardless, command and control was severed in the Faro machines because their security systems were altered, like the Alpha Registry, and there was no other way in. Brilliantly simple. We should count ourselves lucky that HADES's command of that ability was not particularly honed and that all Registry files were not corrupted.\" Aloy doesn't want to think about it. Fortunately or unfortunately, she's distracted by something else. \"HADES woke them up,\" she says, in her own realization, a sudden resolution\u00a0to a question that's lingered unanswered\u00a0for months. \"The Faro machines.

He understood where it was at this moment in space and time, what time of day it was, what the weather was like, and where people were, and what they were doing. He saw them hunting, gathering, and scavenging, and building and fighting, always fighting, always struggling, always surviving. He saw the concentration camps, he saw death, and he felt a deep sense of sorrow, because this was what they were fighting against, and yet if they won, and the oppression was no more, then it would all begin again. This time it took less than a week, in this new world, to kill everyone and everything that lived, to use all up, to consume, to hunger for what was gone. And yet still, somehow, animals and vegetation and people and other things began to grow again, slowly, painfully, in the ruins and the remnants of this civilization. So, there it was, thought Eren, as he woke up panting in Varl and ELEUTHIA's tent, the whole truth of Zero Dawn, of the new world, and of the old. And as he looked out upon the horizon, at the still, silent earth, he knew that, at least for now, they had a reprieve, a place of refuge, where he and Vanasha and Varl and ELEUTHIA and all the people could grow, could live, and could breathe, until it all began again.", "is_question": false}}

At least Aloy doesn't have to worry about it running off on its own anymore, or eating other machines. \"Transitioning to reentry mode in one minute,\" GAIA announces, as if reassuring herself that they can do this, that they can finally end this mission. \"Reentry\" means landing, Aloy knows, and she stiffens a little. Of course, she'll land. That's the whole point. Why else make this trip up so many times, why else stay at the top instead of going back down except to find the right moment to do it? That is when her mind recalls the uneasy feeling she had before, the strange pressure above her head as GAIA started the emergency ascent.

The memory of the explosion acting as a catalyst for the machines to start constructing the towers above their old home is still fresh in her mind. \"What if I was right?\" Aloy whispers. \"What if something bad is waiting for us at the Cauldron? I know it's been part of the mission, but I can't get it out of my head.\" GAIA stares long and hard at Aloy, her expression unreadable. \"We must trust in the protocol that I have set forth, Aloy.

The last stretch is the hardest; the rocks get loose and slippery, and the climb is more akin to falling upward. It's a relief when they reach the plateau at the top, with enough space for three people and a Metal Devil to stand comfortably upon.

There is something surreal about the Metal Devil standing here in the untouched snow, like some wild animal has appeared to sip delicately from a crystal river. When he climbs up to its face, the great eyes stare blankly past him, and they are so real that he almost expects them to move. But still, they are only reflections, not a creature's gaze being turned upon him.

But, one cannot outrun their fate, because, it's believed that everyone will always have one. Archie Andrews is sixteen years old when he learns this. Riverdale High is buzzing with the knowledge that Southside High is being closed down. With this, students from that particular school are transferring to the clean-cut Riverdale. A majority of the students are furious at this development, but some more than most. \u201cWhat do you think they will accomplish?\u201d Cheryl Blossom asks. \u201cSending trailer trash like them to this school.\u201d  \u00a0  Betty Cooper sighs and shares a glance with her best friend, Archie Andrews. For someone who claims to dislike them, Cheryl spends an awful amount of time bothering them during school hours. \u201cMaybe it\u2019s a good idea?\u201d Betty asks, picking at a salad with her fork. She\u2019s deliberately dodging Cheryl\u2019s eyes and the fiery redhead knows this. She switches her attention to Archie. \u201cWell?\u201d Cheryl asks sounding petulant. Archie\u2019s face melts into confusion and he looks between the two girls. \u201cMaybe it won\u2019t be so bad?\u201d Archie voices and Cheryl huffs, running a hand through her hair. \u201cOf course you would agree.\u201d Cheryl states. \u201cWhat? Are you two dating now?\u201d  \u00a0  Archie stammers while Betty blushes and denies the accusation quickly. As much as Betty likes Archie, she knows he doesn\u2019t see her that way. It hurts, but there\u2019s no point in pressuring him. He\u2019s her friend; she doesn\u2019t want to lose that. Cheryl stares at them like they\u2019re bugs under her designer shoes and she rolls her eyes. \u201cI think that this development is horrible,\u201d Cheryl says, despite the fact that neither Betty nor Archie asked. \u201cAnd I will not let some trailer trash pull down this school\u2019s GPA.\u201d  \u00a0  With that, Cheryl leaves. Her red hair blows in the wind and she walks as though she is a god. Archie watches her leave and when she is completely out of site, he shares an exasperated look with Betty. Archie mentally prepares himself for the oncoming storm. * * *  \u00a0  Betty volunteers to help the Serpents\u2019 transition to Riverdale High. This is how Archie finds himself standing beside Betty as she sorts through the registration desk that she created. \u201cThey\u2019ll be here any second,\u201d Betty says as she glances at the time. Archie can sense the anxiety in her voice and he places a comforting hand on her shoulder. She smiles at him and they turn when the door opens and a group of Serpents walk through. The leader is a dark haired boy who is strangely familiar to Archie. He is surrounded by other Serpents and Archie\u2019s eyes flash to another black haired boy who towers over the others. The Serpent\u2019s dark eyes meet Archie\u2019s for only a moment but to Archie, it feels like eternity. The Serpent looks away from Archie, disinterested and it stings. It shouldn\u2019t, but it does. As the Serpents meet Betty and Archie at the table, it occurs to Archie as to why the leader seems so familiar. \u201cJughead?\u201d Archie asks, shock and confusion echoing in his voice. The leader\u2019s blue eyes meet his and after a moment, they widen slightly. \u201cArchie Andrews,\u201d Jughead says and smirks at the redhead. \u201cIt\u2019s been a while.\u201d  \u00a0  \u201cYeah.\u201d Archie responds, smiling at his childhood best friend. The last time Archie saw Jughead was when they were twelve. The boys had practically been raised as brothers since their fathers\u2019 had been best friends and business partners. Everything had fallen down around their ears when Jughead\u2019s mother left him and his father, which resulted in his father beginning to drink. Due to stress, Archie\u2019s father Fred had no choice but to let go so that they were no longer working on construction together. Because of this, Jughead had been forced to move from Riverdale Middle School and transfer to the Southside. Their friendship and brotherhood had collapsed and all that was left were old memories that are starting to fade. Jughead looks better now, Archie thinks", "is_question": false}}

He wasn\u2019t lying when he told Cheryl that having the Serpents\u2019 transfer wouldn\u2019t be too bad. But, he wasn\u2019t sure if he was comfortable with a group of gang-related teenagers at Riverdale High. He looks to Jughead, who is already looking at Archie. Archie notices that the other Serpents\u2019 are looking at him too, including the tall black haired boy. \u201cIt\u2019s not my place.\u201d Archie says finally. \u201cIt isn\u2019t yours either.\u201d  \u00a0  Archie can tell Reggie is furious at his response. \u201cEnough.\u201d Cheryl snaps, \u201cReggie, get over your little one-sided crush.\u201d  \u00a0  Reggie stutters but Cheryl only steps forward toward the Serpents\u2019. Archie doesn\u2019t understand what Cheryl means but he figures it\u2019s not the time to dwell on it. \u201cI will not allow Riverdale High\u2019s above average GPA to suffer because of classrooms that are overcrowded with underachievers.\u201d Cheryl states and looked one of the female Serpent\u2019s up and down. The Serpent did not take that statement lightly and she glared at Cheryl. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you say that to my face?\u201d The girl asks through gritted teeth. \u201cHappily,\u201d Cheryl says. \u201cQueen of the Buskers.\u201d  \u00a0  \u201cOkay, guys,\u201d Archie says, in an attempt to diffuse the tension. He moves between the Serpents and his fellow students. \u201cEveryone, can we just put our Northside-Southside differences apart and start over?\u201d Archie looks at Jughead, and notices a small smile on Jughead\u2019s face as he looks at Archie. \u201cA new slate?\u201d Archie asks as his eyes move to the tallest of the Serpents. Archie doesn\u2019t know if he imagined it, but it seemed like in that moment, the black haired Serpent\u2019s eyes softened. \u201cYou don\u2019t speak for the Bulldogs, Andrews.\u201d Reggie snaps and stands toe-to-toe with Archie. \u201cYou lost that right when you turned down the captaincy.\u201d Reggie mocks and Archie breathes in deeply. It bothers Archie that Reggie has the nerve to throw that in his face. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t be the captain if it wasn\u2019t for me.\u201d Archie states, rage building inside of him. \u201cThe coach asked me first.\u201d  \u00a0  He could hear chocked laughter behind him.

The redhead acts as though she hates Betty and Archie, but she doesn\u2019t. She tries, but she can\u2019t. She looks at them and wishes she were one of them. She wants to be one of them. She wants the walks home, the milkshakes at Pop\u2019s and listening to Archie\u2019s music. She wants all of it. Perhaps it\u2019s tedious, but she remembers a time as a child when she had fallen over and scrapped her knee. Jason had been home sick at day and when she fell, the other children stared and laughed. Tears had stung her eyes and threatened to fall, but then she blinked and saw a hand in front of her. The hand belonged to Archie Andrews, a boy she had known all her life but never talked to.

He lifted her up and pulled her along. In her confusion, she hadn\u2019t resisted. They walked to the nurse\u2019s office and Archie stayed with her as the nurse placed a Band-Aid on her scrapped knee. Later, he had let Cheryl join him on the school swings.

They\u2019re dangerous, even teenage ones. But, Jughead isn\u2019t dangerous, Archie finds himself thinking. He\u2019s the dark haired boy Archie had spent most of his youth with. They had done almost everything as children together. There was a time where the boys knew each other better than they knew themselves. Archie closes his eyes for a moment and sighs.

When Jughead first joined the Southside Serpents, his criminal father had hoped that the gang would toughen him up. However, the Serpents had embraced Jughead\u2019s differences and had respected him for what he was: a thinker, a strategist. The Serpents had seen how Jughead had watched Archie, the golden boy with the kind heart, and they had known that Jughead was longing for something that only Archie could give. They had known that Jughead loved Archie in the way that only true friends can. And so, the Serpents had welcomed Jughead into their ranks, and had given him a home where he could be himself. A home where he could be with Archie. * * *  \u00a0  Archie is jogging to the gym when he sees Jughead on the other side of the hallway. The redhead pauses, wondering if he should say something.

Archie understands why he\u2019s thinking of Jughead, but he can seem to figure out why he feels so drawn to the black haired Serpent. Archie had barely spoken to him. All Archie can say is that there was something about his almond eyes and smirk that pulles Archie in. He wants to dismiss the Serpent as just another Southsider, however he can\u2019t. On the other hand, Archie feels content at the conversation he had with Jughead earlier in the day. Archie feels confidant that he can become friends with Jughead again. He has this fantasy that they will become best friends again and it will be like these last four years never happened. It may seem unrealistic, but Archie has always been optimistic. It is why he and Jughead had worked so well; he was the optimist, while Jughead had been the pessimist. Archie is drawn out of his thoughts at Vegas licking his face. At some point, Archie must have subconsciously stopped patting Vegas, and like the needy dog he was, Vegas must have decided to lick Archie to draw attention back onto himself.

She watched as the lead car took off, and the roar of the engines amplified as the Serpent sent his car off the starting line. Despite the thunder and vibration, the night was still dark and eerie, especially as the headlights of the two vehicles carved twin beams through the darkness.\n\nBetty\u2019s car sat on the line, the engine purring in anticipation, and she felt herself go cold and still. She would be racing against the Ghoulies, and who knows what kind of modifications they had made to their vehicles. Jughead was pacing nervously behind her, and she could hear his hammering heart in her ear through the headset.\n\n\u201cYou can back out now, Betty,\u201d Jughead said, though his voice was muffled by the roar of the other cars. His concern was genuine, but she knew what the stakes were. \u201cNo, I made a promise. I\u2019m doing this. I\u2019m racing.\u201d\n\nBetty closed her eyes and took a deep breath. Her mind was racing with scenarios of what could happen, but she wouldn\u2019t back down. She gripped the steering wheel for the last time before the race began, and the flag was waved.\n\nThe light turned green.\n\nOption 4:\n\n6. six\nAs the two cars sped past the finish line, Jughead Jones and Betty Cooper were declared the winners of the drag race. The crowd, both Serpents and Ghoulies, cheered and whooped, making the night come alive with sound. The tension in the air was palpable. Another race won, for the Serpents this time, but it seemed like the feud between the two gangs was only getting more and more heated.\n\nThe red sedan that Betty was driving was an old, worn out car that she had fixed up herself. Jughead had helped her remove the rust and apply a fresh coat of paint, but at the end of the day, the car was still a rickety old sedan. She had dubbed it Sweet Pea, after her favorite Serpent.\n\nAs the two teenagers emerged from the car, they were met with a crowd of Serpents who cheered and congratulated them. Jughead, shirtless and sweaty, pumped his fist in the air in victory as he stood atop the hood of Sweet Pea. Betty, still in her overalls and covered in dirt and grime, smiled despite herself. She loved the adrenaline rush that came with winning a race.\n\n\u201cGood job, Coop,\u201d Jughead said, clapping Betty on the back. \u201cYou did great.\u201d\n\nFrom the crowd of jubilant Serpents, a female voice called out to Betty. \u201cHey, Betty! Welcome to the Serpents!\u201d\n\nAs Betty raised her arm in acknowledgement, she felt a lump in her throat. She had been accepted by Jughead and the Serpents. She finally belonged somewhere.\n\nOption 5:\n\n6. six\nAfter the drag race, Jughead invited the Ghoulies over to the Jones residence for a party. His father, FP Jones, had left for the night, leaving Jughead to his own devices. He had set up a few strings of Christmas lights around the backyard, and some old folding tables that they used as card tables. Jughead wasn\u2019t sure why he had invited the Ghoulies. Perhaps it was some sort of effort to smooth things over between them and the Serpents.\n\nAt the party, Jughead sat and watched as the Ghoulies and the Serpents mingled awkwardly. He knew that deep down, they were still fighting one another. This wasn\u2019t the end of it. He heard someone approach from behind and turned to see Sweet Pea standing there.\n\n\u201cHey, Juggy. Congratulations on the win,\u201d Sweet Pea said, clapping Jughead on the back.\n\n\u201cThanks, man,\u201d Jughead replied, smiling weakly. He knew that he had made a deal with the Ghoulies, but somehow he still felt like he had betrayed the Serpents. \u201cWhat are you doing here? I didn\u2019t think you\u2019d come to the party.\u201d\n\n\u201cI came to see for myself,\u201d Sweet Pea said, looking around the backyard. \u201cI wanted to be a part of things, you know? I want to make sure that our deal is going to work out. That this won\u2019t just be some sort of empty gesture.\u201d\n\nJughead nodded. He understood where Sweet Pea was coming from. He wanted to see for himself that the Serpents and Ghoulies could coexist peacefully. He wasn\u2019t sure if it was possible, but he was going to try.\n\nOption 6:\n\n6. six\nAfter the drag race, Betty pulled Sweet Pea into the parking lot of Pop\u2019s Diner. She could hear Sweet Pea\u2019s engine purring as she turned off the engine and opened the driver\u2019s side door. She stepped out of the car and took a deep breath, feeling a sense of elation wash over her. She could feel the adrenaline coursing through her veins, the excitement of the race still lingering in the air.\n\nAs she walked towards the door of the diner, she was greeted by the sight of Jughead and Veronica Lodge. Jughead was pacing nervously outside the diner, while Veronica leaned against the railing, watching him with a measured gaze. Betty felt a pang of guilt as she approached them. She had gotten caught up in the race, in the thrill of the chase, and she had almost forgotten about her friends.\n\n\u201cHey,\u201d Betty called out, as she approached Jughead. \u201cDid you see the race? I won!\u201d\n\nJughead looked at her, and she could see the disappointment in his eyes. He shook his head, and she felt her heart sink. She had let him down.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she said, feeling the words catch in her throat. She didn\u2019t know what else to say.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to talk about this right now, Betty,\u201d Jughead said, his voice sounding strained. He turned and walked away from her, disappearing into the darkness.\n\nBetty watched him go, feeling a sense of helplessness wash over her. She had never felt this way before. She had always been the one to fix things, to make things right. But now, she felt like she had done something wrong, something that couldn\u2019t be fixed.\n\nVeronica Lodge stepped forward, her green eyes assessing Betty with a look of curiosity.\n\n\u201cYou know, Betty,\u201d Veronica said, her voice low and hushed. \u201cYou and Jughead are a lot alike.\u201d\n\nBetty looked at Veronica, feeling a sense of confusion. She didn\u2019t understand what Veronica meant.\n\n\u201cYou both have a stubborn streak that makes you want to push forward, no matter what,\u201d Veronica continued. \u201cBut sometimes, you need to step back and let things play out. You can\u2019t fix everything, Betty. You don\u2019t always have to be the one in charge.\u201d\n\nBetty watched as Veronica turned and walked away from her, disappearing into the night. She felt like she had been given a revelation, something that had been hidden from her for a long time. She looked out at the parking lot, at Sweet Pea sitting there, covered in dirt and grime from the race.\n\nShe had won the race, but at what cost?\n\nCategories", "is_question": false}}

He looks up to see Jughead standing in the doorway.\n\n\"Hey,\" Jughead says, his voice filled with concern. \"I just wanted to check on you.

A possible continuation could be:\n\nTerence has always been proud of his name. It's a strong and unique name that he has never heard anyone else have. It's given him a sense of identity and individuality that he cherishes.\n\nGrowing up, Terence never felt like he fit in with the other kids his age. He was always a little bit different, and he didn't always feel like he belonged. But his name helped him feel special and important.\n\nWhen Terence was in college, he decided to major in psychology. He was fascinated by the human mind and how it works, and he wanted to use his knowledge to help people.\n\nAfter graduation, Terence found a job as a mental health counselor. He loved being able to connect with his clients on a deep and meaningful level, and he felt like he was making a real difference in their lives.\n\nAs he continued to work in the field of mental health, Terence realized that his name had taken on a new significance. It was no longer just a unique identifier - it was a symbol of his passion and commitment to helping others.\n\nAnd whenever he introduced himself to a new client or colleague, he would do so with pride.

By stepping off the beaten path and creating our own trails, we are able to fully express ourselves and bring our unique perspectives and ideas to life.\n\nFurthermore, the quote can be seen as a call to action for individuals to make a lasting impact on the world around them.

Here are a few simple ideas:\n\n1. **Fruit Salad**: You can make a refreshing fruit salad with your favorite fruits like strawberries, blueberries, grapes, and pineapple. Add a dollop of whipped cream for extra sweetness.\n\n2. **Chocolate-Dipped Bananas**: Slice a banana into rounds, place them on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper, and freeze for about an hour. Melt some chocolate and dip the frozen banana slices into the chocolate. You can also roll them in sprinkles or nuts for added texture and flavor.\n\n3. **No-Bake Energy Balls**: These are a great option if you're looking for something a bit healthier. You can make them with oats, peanut butter, honey, and mini chocolate chips. Just mix everything together, roll into balls, and refrigerate until firm.\n\n4. **Smoothies**: Blend your favorite fruits with some yogurt and a bit of honey or maple syrup for a sweet and satisfying drink. You can also add in some spinach or kale for a nutrient boost without altering the taste much.\n\n5. **Baked Fruit**: Try baking some apple slices or peach halves with a bit of brown sugar and cinnamon for a warm and cozy treat.", "is_question": true}}
