Melt some chocolate and dip the frozen banana slices into the chocolate. You can also roll them in sprinkles or nuts for added texture and flavor.\n\n3. **No-Bake Energy Balls**: These are a great option if you're looking for something a bit healthier. You can make them with oats, peanut butter, honey, and mini chocolate chips. Just mix everything together, roll into balls, and refrigerate until firm.\n\n4. **Smoothies**: Blend your favorite fruits with some yogurt and a bit of honey or maple syrup for a sweet and satisfying drink. You can also add in some spinach or kale for a nutrient boost without altering the taste much.\n\n5. **Baked Fruit**: Try baking some apple slices or peach halves with a bit of brown sugar and cinnamon for a warm and cozy treat.",
