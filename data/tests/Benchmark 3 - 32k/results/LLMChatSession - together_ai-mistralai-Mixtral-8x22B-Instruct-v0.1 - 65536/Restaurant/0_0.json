    "Agent (2024-05-29 17:05:23.782455):  Absolutely, I can help you with that. If you're looking to buy soap online, there are numerous places you can check. Amazon, eBay, and Walmart are popular options with a wide variety of soaps to choose from. You might want to consider the brand, type (like hand soap, body soap, or face soap), and price. If you prefer shopping in person, stores like Target, Walgreens, or your local grocery store should have a good selection as well.",

    "Test (2024-05-29 17:05:32.371945): (On TV) The skirt is in the pantry.\n",
    "Agent (2024-05-29 17:05:36.602956):  Interesting context! If we're playing along with this scenario, it seems like there might be a hidden message or code in the phrase \"The skirt is in the pantry.\"\n\nHowever, without additional context or information, it's hard to provide a definitive interpretation. In a literal sense, a skirt would typically not be found in a pantry, which is a place for storing food or kitchen supplies.\n\nIn a broader context, such as a mystery game or a spy movie, this phrase could be a hint or a secret message. For example, \"skirt\" might represent a person (possibly a woman), and \"pantry\" might represent a location. But remember, this is just a creative interpretation.\n\nPlease provide more context or information if you'd like a more specific response.",
