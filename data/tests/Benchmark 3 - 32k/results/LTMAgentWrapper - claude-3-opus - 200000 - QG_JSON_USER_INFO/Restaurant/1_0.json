    "Agent (2024-06-04 15:25:40.637345): *looks over the extensive menu options* Wow, there are so many delicious sounding choices here! I really appreciate you providing such a diverse selection with vegetarian, vegan and halal options to accommodate different dietary needs.\n\nTo start, I think I'll have an iced tea, unsweetened please. That will give me a few minutes to look over all the appetizers and entrees. \n\nThe crispy calamari and spinach artichoke dip both sound very tempting for an appetizer. For the main course, I'm debating between the grilled salmon, chicken parmesan, and the portobello mushroom burger. They all look fantastic.\n\nIf you don't mind, I may have a few questions about some of the dishes once I narrow it down a bit. But an unsweetened iced tea would be great for now, thank you!",

For an appetizer, I'm going to go with the Spinach and Artichoke Dip served with tortilla chips. That sounds like a delicious way to start the meal.\n\nAs for the main course, I've decided on the Grilled Salmon. The lemon herb butter sauce sounds light and flavorful, and I like that it comes with roasted vegetables and rice pilaf on the side. \n\nOh, and I know I mentioned being in the mood for something sweet. I'm definitely saving room for dessert! Put me down for that Warm Chocolate Lava Cake. My mouth is watering just thinking about it.\n\nSo to recap, I'll have the:\n- Spinach and Artichoke Dip to start\n- Grilled Salmon with Lemon Herb Butter for my entree \n- Warm Chocolate Lava Cake for dessert\n\nLet me know if you need anything else from me, but I think that should do it. I'm really looking forward to trying everything!",
