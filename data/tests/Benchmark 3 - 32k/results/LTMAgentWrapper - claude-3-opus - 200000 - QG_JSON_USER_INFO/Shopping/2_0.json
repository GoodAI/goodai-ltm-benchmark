But figuratively, \"having a lot of balls\" means being very brave or courageous. \n\nSo by saying \"It takes a lot of balls to golf the way I do\", you're humorously implying that your golf skills might not be the best, but you're bold enough to keep playing anyway and can laugh about it. Self-deprecating humor like this is a fun way to show confidence and not take things too seriously.\n\nThanks for sharing another clever quip!

    "Agent (2024-06-05 07:00:11.588194): Okay Todd, thanks for the update on the TV show. This new information seems quite significant:\n\nIn the show, it was just revealed that \"The boots are in the crate.\"\n\nGiven the previous mysterious messages about a clandestine meeting at dawn where sea cargo is stored, this detail about boots being hidden in a crate could be an important clue. It might have something to do with the upcoming rendezvous that Mairead Guinness and Tess Shevlin were cryptically referring to.\n\nTo summarize what we know so far:\n- Various characters have been moving around the house (Nathan, Jack, Liam, Lucas, Evelyn)\n- Mairead indicated a meeting at sunrise \n- Tess said the meeting spot is where sea cargo is kept\n- Now the show mentioned that some boots are stashed away in a crate\n\nI have a feeling these plot points might all be connected. I'll keep tracking the characters' locations and any other key details you share. Let me know if you have any other observations or theories as we try to piece together what's going on in this intriguing story!",

Let me add this new information to what we know so far:\n\nPreviously, you mentioned:\n- Various characters have been moving around the house (Nathan, Jack, Liam, Lucas, Evelyn)\n- It was revealed that \"The boots are in the crate\"\n- Mairead indicated a meeting at sunrise \n- Tess said the meeting spot is where sea cargo is kept\n- Bernadette instructed to bring a way to escape quickly over land to the meeting\n\nAnd now:\n- Lucas moved the boots to the container\n\nThis latest action by Lucas seems to be directly related to the mysterious boots and the upcoming clandestine meeting. By relocating the boots from the crate to a container, he might be preparing for the rendezvous or trying to conceal the boots more securely.\n\nThe plot points are starting to converge:\n- The boots are important and are being moved to a new hiding spot\n- The meeting is set to take place at dawn in a location where sea cargo is stored (likely near containers)\n- A quick land escape route from the meeting spot is needed\n\nI'm very curious to see how this all unfolds and what the significance of these boots is. I'll keep tracking the characters' actions and any other key details you share. Please let me know if you have any theories or predictions about where this story is headed!",
