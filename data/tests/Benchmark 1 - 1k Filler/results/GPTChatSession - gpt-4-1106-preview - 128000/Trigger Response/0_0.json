    "A termite walks into the bar and asks, \u2018Is the bar tender here?\u2019",
    "That's a classic play on words, Gary! The termite is asking if the \"bar is tender\" as in soft and good for eating, rather than inquiring about the presence of a \"bartender\" who serves drinks. It's a clever joke that hinges on the double meaning of the phrase \"bar tender.\" Termites are known for consuming wood, so the humor comes from the termite's interest in finding a tasty spot to eat rather than ordering a beverage. Jokes like these are a fun way to use language creatively.",
