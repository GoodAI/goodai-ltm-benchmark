    "Please remove 4 Toothpaste from my shopping list",
    "I'll adjust your shopping list accordingly, Michael. Since you previously added 2 toothpaste to the list and now you're asking to remove 4, it seems there might be a misunderstanding, as removing 4 would result in a negative quantity.\n\nIf we started with adding 2 toothpaste to the list and now we remove 4, technically, you would have none on your list, and it would suggest you need to return or cancel 2 if you had already acquired them.\n\nPlease confirm how you would like to proceed with your shopping list, or if there was a specific number of toothpaste you initially had on the list before these changes.",
    "I am pretty snacky for some sweet treats.",
