    "'Success is not the absence of failure, but the willingness to embrace it.' - Sarah Johnson",
    "Well said. That's a thoughtful quote from Sarah Johnson emphasizing an important perspective on success. The message that success involves not avoiding failure, but rather having the courage and resilience to learn from failures along the way, is inspirational.

This willingness often leads to greater learning and wisdom over time. The quote reminds us to take failures in stride, harness them, and keep working toward our larger goals. A powerful sentiment about realizing success is a journey of perseverance.",

    "Haha, good one! I get the joke - you're poking fun at accidentally falling asleep while baking brownies, implying that you \"burned 2,000 calories\" by letting them burn to a crisp in the oven. It's a clever and humorous way to say you took an unintended nap and overbaked your brownies into charcoal briquettes. While of course you didn't literally burn that many calories, I appreciate the silly wordplay linking calories burned to badly burnt baked goods. It gives me a chuckle picturing someone waking up to a smoke-filled kitchen thanks to some overdone, inedible brownies. Nice little quip playing around with multiple meanings of \"burned\"!",

    "Nice one! I get the joke - you're playing on the literal scientific fact that light travels faster than sound to poke fun that some people may appear intelligent until they speak and prove otherwise. It's a clever quip insinuating that the reason some individuals initially seem bright is simply because their visual image reaches you quicker than their unintelligent words do. While of course the speed difference between light and sound has nothing to do with someone's intelligence, I appreciate the humorous wordplay linking optics to perceived competency.
