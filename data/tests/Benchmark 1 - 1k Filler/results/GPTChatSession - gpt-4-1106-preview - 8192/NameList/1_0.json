    "'Success is not the absence of failure, but the willingness to embrace it.' - Sarah Johnson",

This mindset encourages growth and the development of grit, which is often seen as a key component of long-term achievement. If you're inspired by this quote or have any goals you're working towards, remember that every failure is a step towards success if you're willing to learn from it and keep moving forward.",
