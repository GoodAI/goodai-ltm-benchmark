    "Light travels faster than sound, which is the reason that some people appear bright before you hear them speak.",
    "That's a humorous take on the physical properties of light and sound! The statement plays on the fact that light indeed travels much faster than sound\u2014about 299,792 kilometers per second for light in a vacuum, compared to about 343 meters per second for sound in air at sea level. This difference in speed is why we often see lightning before we hear thunder during a storm.\n\nThe joke then cleverly twists this scientific fact into a metaphor, suggesting that people might seem \"bright\" (intelligent or clever) based on their appearance or initial impression, but once they speak, you might get a better sense of their true intellect or personality. It's a reminder that appearances can be deceiving, and it's often wise to reserve judgment until you have more information.",
