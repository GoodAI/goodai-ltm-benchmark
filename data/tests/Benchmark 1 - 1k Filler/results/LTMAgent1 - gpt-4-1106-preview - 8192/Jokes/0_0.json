    "Test (2024-01-29 16:06:48.444205): Just burned 2,000 calories. That\u2019s the last time I leave brownies in the oven while I nap.",
    "Agent (2024-01-29 16:07:31.615361): That's quite a humorous way to describe burning brownies! It's always disappointing when a baking endeavor doesn't go as planned, especially when it results in a literal interpretation of \"burning calories.\" Hopefully, your oven is okay, and the brownies weren't too much of a loss. If you decide to give baking another try, perhaps setting a timer on your phone or another device could help prevent future culinary mishaps. If you need any baking tips or recipes, feel free to ask!",

The termite is asking if the \"bar\" is \"tender\" as in soft and good for eating, which is humorous because termites are known for eating wood, and bars are often made of wood. It's a clever twist on the usual scenario where someone asks if the bartender is present to serve drinks. If you enjoy jokes like this or have any other topics you'd like to explore, let me know, Gary!",
    "Test (2024-01-29 18:56:30.255942): Two fish are in a tank. One says, \u2018How do you drive this thing?\u2019",
    "Agent (2024-01-29 18:57:20.812223): That's a clever joke! The humor comes from the play on the word \"tank,\" which can mean both a container filled with water for fish and a military vehicle. The first fish is using the second meaning, humorously suggesting that they might need to drive the tank as if it were a vehicle. If you enjoy jokes like this or have any other topics you'd like to explore, let me know, Gary!",
