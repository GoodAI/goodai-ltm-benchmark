    "Agent (2024-01-29 10:41:43.971672): That's a profound and motivational quote attributed to the fictitious philosopher Johnathan Rivers. It echoes the sentiment of a well-known proverb, \"A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step,\" often attributed to the Chinese philosopher Laozi. This idea emphasizes the importance of taking action, no matter how small, to initiate progress and personal growth. It suggests that even the most daunting tasks or ambitious goals can be achieved by starting with a simple, decisive act. If you're looking to apply this wisdom in your own life, Gary, remember that every big achievement starts with the decision to try and the courage to take that initial step forward.",
