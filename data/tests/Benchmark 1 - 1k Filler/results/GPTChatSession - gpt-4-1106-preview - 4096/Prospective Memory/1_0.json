    "Test (2024-01-29 17:29:55.389669): 'Success is not the absence of failure, but the willingness to embrace it.' - Sarah Johnson",
    "Agent (2024-01-29 17:30:09.504735): That's a thoughtful quote and it carries a powerful message about the nature of success and failure. While the quote is attributed here to Sarah Johnson, it's important to note that variations of this sentiment have been expressed by various authors, speakers, and thought leaders over time.\n\nThe essence of the quote is that success isn't defined by never failing, but rather by the attitude one has towards setbacks and challenges. Embracing failure as a part of the journey to success is crucial because it is often through mistakes and missteps that we learn, grow, and improve. Failure can provide valuable lessons that, when taken to heart, can pave the way to future achievements.\n\nThis perspective encourages resilience, perseverance, and a growth mindset, which are key attributes for anyone striving to accomplish their goals. It suggests that one should not fear failure but accept it as an opportunity to develop and refine one's approach on the path to success.",
