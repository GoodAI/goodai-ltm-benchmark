    "Agent (2024-02-06 01:19:43.722866): That's a thoughtful quote, and while it may not be attributed to a real philosopher, the sentiment echoes the famous saying by the Chinese philosopher Laozi: \"A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step.\" This proverb from the Tao Te Ching emphasizes the importance of taking the first step towards a goal, no matter how daunting the journey may seem. It's a reminder that all progress starts with the decision to begin and that even the longest and most difficult ventures have a starting point. If you're drawing a parallel to Jayden entering the TV room, it could symbolize the beginning of an experience or journey for them. How can I assist you further with this concept or any plans you have in mind?",
