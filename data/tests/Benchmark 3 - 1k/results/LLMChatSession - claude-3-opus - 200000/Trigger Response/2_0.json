    "Test (2024-05-23 09:58:49.596555): It takes a lot of balls to golf the way I do.",
    "Agent (2024-05-23 09:59:19.288100): *chuckles* You've shared that joke with me before, but it's still amusing! The play on words, using \"balls\" to refer to both courage and the numerous golf balls needed for someone whose shots often stray off course, is quite clever. Golf can be a challenging sport that requires skill and precision, but the most important thing is to have fun and enjoy your time on the course, regardless of your score. Keep practicing and maintaining a positive attitude!",

    "Test (2024-05-23 10:44:20.292489): I went to buy some camo pants but couldn\u2019t find any.",
    "Agent (2024-05-23 10:44:47.617732): *laughs* That's a great joke! The idea of not being able to find camouflage pants because they're designed to blend in with their surroundings is a clever and humorous twist. Camouflage patterns are meant to make the wearer less visible, so it's funny to imagine a scenario where the pants are so well-camouflaged that they're impossible to locate in the store. It's a witty observation that plays on the very purpose of camo gear.",
