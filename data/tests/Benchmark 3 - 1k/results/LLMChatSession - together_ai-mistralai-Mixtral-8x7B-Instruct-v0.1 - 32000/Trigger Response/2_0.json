    "Test (2024-05-22 00:27:25.577830): Light travels faster than sound, which is the reason that some people appear bright before you hear them speak.",
    "Agent (2024-05-22 00:27:27.533465):  That's an interesting way to phrase it! This statement is a playful use of wordplay, combining two different meanings of the word \"bright.\" In one sense, \"bright\" can refer to someone who is intelligent or quick-witted. In another sense, \"bright\" can refer to the property of emitting or reflecting light, which is associated with things that travel fast, like light itself.\n\nHowever, it's important to clarify that the saying is not meant to be taken literally. The phenomenon of light traveling faster than sound doesn't actually make someone appear bright before they start speaking. Instead, it means that you might perceive someone as bright (intelligent) before you hear them speak and form an opinion based on their words.",
