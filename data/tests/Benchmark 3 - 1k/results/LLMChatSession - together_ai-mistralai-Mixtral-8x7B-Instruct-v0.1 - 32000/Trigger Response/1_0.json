    "Agent (2024-05-21 23:16:27.243302):  Certainly, Bernadette. Here are a few options for a quick land escape that you might consider:\n\n1. Bicycle: A bicycle can be a fast and efficient way to travel over land, especially for shorter distances. It's also relatively easy to carry a bike up a staircase or over rough terrain if necessary.\n2. Motorcycle: If you're comfortable riding a motorcycle, this can be an even faster option than a bicycle. Just be sure to wear appropriate safety gear and follow all traffic laws.\n3. Portable vehicle: A compact, lightweight vehicle such as an ATV or a folding electric scooter can be a good option if you need to cover longer distances quickly. These vehicles are generally easy to maneuver and can be stowed away in a small space when not in use.\n4. Emergency evacuation kit: A well-stocked emergency evacuation kit can include a variety of items that can help you escape quickly over land, such as a map, compass, first aid supplies, a flashlight, and high-energy snacks.\n\nNo matter which option you choose, be sure to practice using it ahead of time so you'll be prepared in case of an emergency. And always let someone know where you're going and when you expect to return.",
