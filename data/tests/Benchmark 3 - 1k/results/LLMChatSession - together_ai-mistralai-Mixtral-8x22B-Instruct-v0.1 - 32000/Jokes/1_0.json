    "Test (2024-05-21 22:56:01.785549): Two fish are in a tank. One says, \u2018How do you drive this thing?\u2019",
    "Agent (2024-05-21 22:56:06.176296):  This joke relies on the absurdity of fish attempting to operate a complex vehicle such as a tank, which is intended to be humorous.

    "Agent (2024-05-22 01:52:17.707420):           The statement \"It takes a lot of balls to golf the way I do\" is a display of confidence and bravado, suggesting that the speaker possesses a significant amount of skill and courage in the sport of golf.
