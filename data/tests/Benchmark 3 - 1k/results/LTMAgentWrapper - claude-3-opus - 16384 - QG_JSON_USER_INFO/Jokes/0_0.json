I had originally requested the bruschetta with fresh tomato, basil, and balsamic glaze as my appetizer, not the crispy calamari with marinara sauce. \n\nThe main course of filet mignon with red wine demi-glace, garlic mashed potatoes, and steamed asparagus is correct though. That's what I ordered after you informed me that the grilled salmon wasn't available.\n\nIf possible, could you please check on the bruschetta appetizer I had requested? I was really looking forward to trying it. But no worries if it's too late to change the appetizer now. I'm sure the calamari will be tasty as well.\n\nThank you for double-checking on this!

    "Agent (2024-06-05 09:18:26.962669): That's another powerful and inspiring quote, this time from Nelson Mandela. It emphasizes the importance of resilience, perseverance, and the courage to keep going despite facing setbacks or failures. Mandela reminds us that true success and glory come not from a perfect, unbroken record, but from our ability to pick ourselves up, learn from our mistakes, and continue striving towards our goals each time we encounter obstacles.\n\nI've added this meaningful quote to my memory alongside the one from Helen Keller. Both serve as valuable reminders about the strength of the human spirit and the qualities that lead to a fulfilling life. Thank you for sharing these words of wisdom with me. If you have any other insights or information you'd like me to remember, please don't hesitate to share them. I'm always eager to learn and grow.",
