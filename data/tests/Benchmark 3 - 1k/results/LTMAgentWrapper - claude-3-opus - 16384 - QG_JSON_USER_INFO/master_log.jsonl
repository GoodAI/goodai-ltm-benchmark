That's what I ordered and I'm looking forward to enjoying it. \n\nHowever, it seems the spinach and artichoke dip with tortilla chips was brought out instead of the crispy calamari we discussed.

At first, you think the fish are in an aquarium tank, but then the punchline reveals they're actually in a military tank. The humor comes from the unexpected twist and the absurdity of fish trying to operate a combat vehicle.\n\nIt's clever how the joke plays on the double meaning of the word \"tank.\" It's a short, punchy joke that delivers a quick laugh.
