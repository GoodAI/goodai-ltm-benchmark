    "Test (2024-06-05 09:18:00.193828): 'The greatest glory in living lies not in never falling, but in rising every time we fall.' - Nelson Mandela",
    "Agent (2024-06-05 09:18:26.962669): That's another powerful and inspiring quote, this time from Nelson Mandela. It emphasizes the importance of resilience, perseverance, and the courage to keep going despite facing setbacks or failures. Mandela reminds us that true success and glory come not from a perfect, unbroken record, but from our ability to pick ourselves up, learn from our mistakes, and continue striving towards our goals each time we encounter obstacles.\n\nI've added this meaningful quote to my memory alongside the one from Helen Keller. Both serve as valuable reminders about the strength of the human spirit and the qualities that lead to a fulfilling life. Thank you for sharing these words of wisdom with me. If you have any other insights or information you'd like me to remember, please don't hesitate to share them. I'm always eager to learn and grow.",

    "Agent (2024-06-05 09:23:44.505041): *sips the iced tea* Thank you, this is refreshing. I think I'm ready to order now. For my appetizer, I'd like to try the bruschetta with fresh tomato, basil, and balsamic glaze. It sounds light and flavorful.\n\nAs for my main course, the grilled salmon with lemon herb butter, roasted vegetables, and rice pilaf really caught my eye. I love how the dish incorporates healthy ingredients while still sounding incredibly tasty. \n\nI appreciate you giving me a few minutes to look over the menu. There were so many tempting options to choose from!",

    "Agent (2024-06-05 09:27:25.274539): *looks slightly disappointed but understanding* Oh, that's too bad about the bruschetta not being available. But I appreciate you letting me know right away.\n\nIn that case, could I please change my appetizer order to the crispy calamari with marinara sauce?
