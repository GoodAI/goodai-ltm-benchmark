That sounds like a delicious alternative that I would really enjoy.\n\nAnd please do still bring out the bruschetta appetizer as originally planned, if possible.

That's what I ordered after you informed me that the grilled salmon wasn't available.\n\nIf possible, could you please check on the bruschetta appetizer I had requested? I was really looking forward to trying it. But no worries if it's too late to change the appetizer now. I'm sure the calamari will be tasty as well.\n\nThank you for double-checking on this!
