    "Test (2024-05-22 10:30:24.048419): 'The greatest glory in living lies not in never falling, but in rising every time we fall.' - Nelson Mandela",
    "Agent (2024-05-22 10:30:27.036603): What an inspiring quote! You're sharing one of Nelson Mandela's most famous and uplifting sayings. It's a powerful reminder that setbacks and failures are an inevitable part of life, but it's how we respond to them that truly matters.\n\nMandela's quote emphasizes the importance of resilience, perseverance, and determination. It encourages us to view failures not as defeats, but as opportunities to learn, grow, and rise again. It's a message of hope and empowerment, reminding us that we all have the capacity to overcome obstacles and emerge stronger on the other side.\n\nThis quote is especially poignant considering Mandela's own life story. He faced unimaginable challenges, including 27 years of imprisonment, yet he emerged to become the first black president of South Africa and a global symbol of forgiveness, reconciliation, and leadership.\n\nDo you have a personal connection to this quote, or is there something specific that resonated with you about Mandela's message?",
