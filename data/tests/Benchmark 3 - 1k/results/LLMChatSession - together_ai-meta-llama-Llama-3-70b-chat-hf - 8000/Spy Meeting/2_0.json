    "Test (2024-05-22 20:35:55.657698): Light travels faster than sound, which is the reason that some people appear bright before you hear them speak.",
    "Agent (2024-05-22 20:36:00.543175): I think there might be some misunderstanding here! The phenomenon you're describing isn't actually related to the speed of light vs. sound.\n\nLight travels at approximately 299,792,458 meters per second, while sound travels at approximately 343 meters per second in air. This means that light reaches our eyes almost instantly, while sound takes a little longer to reach our ears.\n\nHowever, the reason why some people might appear bright before you hear them speak has more to do with human perception and cognitive biases rather than the physical properties of light and sound. Here are a few possible explanations:\n\n1. **Visual processing:** Our brains process visual information faster than auditory information. When we see someone, our brain quickly analyzes their appearance, facial expression, and body language, which can create an impression before we even hear them speak.\n2. **First impressions:** We tend to form first impressions based on people's appearance, demeanor, and behavior. This can be influenced by factors like fashion sense, grooming, and confidence, which can create an initial impression of \"brightness\" or intelligence before we even hear them speak.\n3. **Stereotyping and biases:** Unfortunately, our brains can also fall victim to stereotypes and biases based on physical appearance. This can lead us to make incorrect assumptions about someone's intelligence or abilities before we even hear them speak.\n\nIt's essential to remember that these initial impressions can be misleading and shouldn't be taken as a reliable indicator of someone's intelligence or abilities. It's always best to engage with people, listen to their thoughts and ideas, and get to know them beyond superficial appearances.",
