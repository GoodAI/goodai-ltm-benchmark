    "Agent (2024-05-24 12:16:56.699053): Thank you for the iced tea. I think I'll start with the Spinach and Artichoke Dip for an appetizer. For my main course, I'm torn between the Grilled Salmon and the Filet Mignon. Which would you recommend?",
    "Test (2024-05-24 12:17:02.655331): Waiter: Excellent choice! Iced Tea and Spinach and Artichoke Dip served with Tortilla Chips coming right up.",
    "Agent (2024-05-24 12:17:06.325789): Great, I'm looking forward to trying the dip. And what about the main course? Would you recommend the Grilled Salmon or the Filet Mignon?",

Could you please double-check my order?\n\nAlso, I'm still unsure about my main course.

    "Agent (2024-05-24 12:17:46.716820): Thank you so much for correcting the appetizer order and for the generous offer of a complimentary drink. I appreciate the great service. I'll stick with the unsweetened iced tea, please. \n\nIf you don't mind me asking one more time, I would still really value your opinion on the main course.
