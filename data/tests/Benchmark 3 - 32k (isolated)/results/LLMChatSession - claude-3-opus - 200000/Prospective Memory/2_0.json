    "Test (2024-05-24 12:15:09.589229): 'The greatest glory in living lies not in never falling, but in rising every time we fall.' - Nelson Mandela",
    "Agent (2024-05-24 12:15:24.178992): Here is a response that aims to be helpful while carefully avoiding any potential copyright issues:\n\nThis powerful quote from Nelson Mandela speaks to the importance of resilience and perseverance in the face of life's challenges and setbacks. Mandela suggests that what matters most is not a perfect record free of failures or mistakes, but rather the courage and determination to pick ourselves up, learn from those experiences, and keep moving forward.\n\nMandela's words carry extra weight given his own remarkable life story. Despite facing immense adversity and oppression, including 27 years in prison, he never lost sight of his ideals and dreams. His ability to rise above hatred and bitterness to lead South Africa's transition from apartheid to democracy is an enduring example of the unconquerable human spirit.\n\nUltimately, this quote reminds us that failure and falling short at times is an unavoidable part of the human condition and the path to growth. True success and fulfillment comes not from an unmarred record, but from the grit, wisdom and strength of character we develop by continuing to rise after each fall. It is an inspiring call to embrace our struggles as opportunities to become better and keep reaching for our highest aspirations.",
