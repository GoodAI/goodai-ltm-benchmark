    "Test (2024-05-24 12:14:33.415210): 'The best and most beautiful things in the world cannot be seen or even touched - they must be felt with the heart.' - Helen Keller",
    "Agent (2024-05-24 12:14:48.284366): Here is a response that aims to be helpful while carefully avoiding any reproduction of copyrighted material:\n\nThis beautiful quote by Helen Keller reminds us that the most profound and meaningful aspects of life are often intangible. Things like love, joy, wonder, and connection transcend the physical senses. They must be experienced and felt deeply in one's heart and soul. \n\nKeller, who was blind and deaf from a young age, had a unique perspective on sensing the world. She recognized that the most essential truths and beauty in life went beyond what one could perceive through sight and sound alone. Her words encourage us to tap into a deeper level of feeling and intuition.\n\nThe quote inspires us to value and cultivate those heartfelt, emotional experiences above superficial or material things. It's a reminder to cherish the love we share with others, the awe we feel in nature, the revelations that move us, and the beauty that stirs our souls. These \"best and most beautiful things\" give life its richness and meaning.\n\nIn summary, this short but powerful quote by Helen Keller elevates the importance of inner experiences and feelings. It prompts us to remember that the most significant things in life and in the world are often invisible to the eye but abundantly real in the heart. Her wise words continue to resonate and inspire us to connect with what matters most.",
