    "Test (2024-05-24 11:45:10.205871): 1st page:\n\n\t1. Thoughts keep getting tangled in my head    This is a side of him that no one\u2019s ever seen. It\u2019s true for Taehyung too, but even more so for himself. It\u2019s not like he hasn\u2019t slept over friend\u2019s houses, or no one else has ever seen him sleeping before. But this. This is different. The light coming from the window is usually scarce, because Jungkook doesn\u2019t like waking up with the sun in his eyes, nor does Taehyung. However, the night before Taehyung had insisted that they should watch the stars together, because he\u2019s been studying them and he wanted to show everything he had learned to Jungkook as well. (Jungkook was studying them too, because he was really curious about things, especially things Taehyung was curious about, but he enjoyed to listen to Taehyung talk as if he was teaching him from scratch, his observations and words always beautiful and way more interesting than the ones Jungkook had read on the internet.) So, this time around, Taehyung\u2019s face is clear and bright under the morning light, the slope of his nose highlighted, each and every mole apparent, lips puffed and slightly parted, face squished against the pillow by Jungkook\u2019s side on Jungkook\u2019s bed. And Jungkook stares, because he\u2019s not fully awake just yet. He takes a while to wake up, always have, and therefore there\u2019s nothing to stop him from staring. Even blinking comes slow and lazily, and that has nothing to do with the fact he\u2019s a little hypnotized by the view. It\u2019s just how it is. How things are. How he is. Hopefully, how they are. It\u2019s simply not a step he\u2019s willing to take. Not right now. A step bigger than his legs are, that\u2019s what it feels like. He wants to reach for it, oh, Jungkook does. But that might scare Taehyung away. Taehyung isn\u2019t ready for that just yet. And that\u2019s really fine. Just, moments like this, under the rising sun, on his bed, by Taehyung\u2019s side, this feels all too different. Too beautiful, too good, too much. His chest aches, then, for something. A warmth. Someone. A proximity lacking, and he needs it then, as if his life depends on it, his chest is pulling Taehyung to him, begging, screaming, heart threatening to burst through if Jungkook doesn\u2019t do something, anything. Maybe it works, and the thing inside his chest is so strong that it manages to make Taehyung stir in his sleep, and literally roll to Jungkook\u2019s side. Or it\u2019s just Taehyung, being Taehyung, and squishing his face into Jungkook\u2019s chest is just way better than any pillow could ever be. He sighs in contentment, sinking further into Jungkook\u2019s aching chest, and in a moment it\u2019s like there was never any pain there, to begin with. I must be going crazy, is what Jungkook thinks, breathing through his nose as slowly and quietly as he can. \u201c\u2018Mmnornin, Koo.\u201d  A heartbeat\u2014one Taehyung certainly hears, left ear pressed against Jungkook\u2019s heart\u2014and a soft smile on Jungkook\u2019s lips as he replies, voice hoarse from sleep:  \u201cGood morning, Taetae.\u201d  And Jungkook is glad he gets to wake up like this a bunch of days. Because this. This is special. On other days he wakes up with a punch to the stomach, yeah, sometimes even with a pair of feet resting way too close to his face, but still. Still, this isn\u2019t something he\u2019d ever trade. \t2. Chapter 2  The bad thing about sleeping with Jungkook is the one thing that shouldn\u2019t be bad at all about sleeping. Only, it\u2019s 7h10 and Taehyung really needs to wake up, really needs to get ready to work, really needs to _get out of bed._  But capitalism. As Yoongi said, capitalism ruined the simplest, most beautiful thing ever. Sleep",
    "Agent (2024-05-24 11:45:24.121153): It seems like you've read me an excerpt from a fictional story or novel, depicting an intimate moment between two characters named Jungkook and Taehyung as they wake up together one morning. The passage describes Jungkook's internal thoughts and feelings as he gazes at a sleeping Taehyung in the morning light, hinting at deeper romantic feelings he holds for his friend that he is hesitant to act on. \n\nThe writing has a tender, introspective tone as it explores the closeness and comfort between the two characters. There are references to them often sleeping over at each other's places, but this particular morning feeling different and special to Jungkook.\n\nThe second part seems to shift to Taehyung's perspective, lamenting having to get up for work when he would rather stay sleeping next to Jungkook, with a humorous reference to their friend Yoongi's views on capitalism.\n\nWithout more context it's hard to say much else, but the passage establishes a close, affectionate relationship between the two main characters with the potential for romance. Let me know if you'd like me to share any other thoughts or reactions to this excerpt!",
    "Test (2024-05-24 11:45:24.125385): 2nd page:\n\nSomething to make Taehyung sleep like a rock, and wake up like he just had the best night of rest in years, but also like he could keep on sleeping like that forever. _Drugs._ That should be it. Because it _is_ addicting. Once he found his way into Jungkook\u2019s bed, it was really hard to resist the urge of inviting himself in every night. He only did it for the sake of Jungkook not getting tired of him, and throwing him out of their shared apartment. \u201cKoo, we gotta wake up now.\u201d  Jungkook mumbles this time, maybe they took a ten minutes nap from the moment they exchanged good mornings. It happens frequently. Taehyung pokes his ribs, rather carefully, but the location guarantees an immediate reaction. The body under him moved, and Taehyung looks up to find an angry look pointed down at his face. \u201cMust you hurt me in order to wake me up, Taehyung?\u201d  \u201cYeah. Otherwise, you never do, not as fast as we need you to, at least. Plus, that didn\u2019t really hurt, you\u2019re just being a baby.\u201d  \u201cIt hurt. I\u2019m very sensitive when I wake up.\u201d  Taehyung almost beams at the slip-up, his day already made when his lips part and he pronounces very attentively:  \u201cOh?\u201d  Jungkook is torn between blushing and grunting, and that gets a pillow smashed into Taehyung\u2019s face. \u201cWhy are you like this?\u201d He rolls out of bed, maybe suppressing his laughter. Taehyung giggles, getting up too. \u201cThis is an important piece of information, Koo, I can tell your future girlfriend about it, and that\u2019s gonna be good for you later.\u201d  He winks, and Jungkook visibly rolls his eyes. \u201cYeah, and she wouldn\u2019t find it suspicious at all that you somehow seem to have this important piece of information.\u201d  Taehyung realizes\u00a0a lot of things at once, but the most important one is that Jungkook shouldn\u2019t get a girlfriend anytime soon. That would mean the end of their nights sleeping together. He feels too selfish to actually say that out loud, so he moved to the bathroom instead, Jungkook\u2019s bathroom, and grabbed his toothbrush, his extra toothbrush that has been used more times than his actual toothbrush, almost forgotten at his own bathroom. Still, Jungkook is too attentive to let something like this pass by unnoticed, his eyes are careful on Taehyung and some of the hairs on his nape bristle as an effect. Jungkook walks to his side and grabs his own toothbrush. \u201cWhat?\u201d  Taehyung stops brushing. \u201cPromise me one thing.\u201d  \u201cHuh?\u201d  \u201cJust say you\u2019ll promise me one thing.\u201d  Jungkook looks down to his toothbrush as he puts on some toothpaste. \u201cThat\u2019s already a promise, Tae.\u201d  \u201cWhatever. Then promise twice.\u201d  Jungkook smiles, rather softly. \u201cYeah, okay.\u201d  \u201cHm. Good.\u201d Taehyung takes the toothbrush off his mouth, and lowers himself to spit on the sink. When he rises again, Jungkook is brushing his teeth, waiting only mildly curiously. \u201cThen promise we\u2019ll still do everything we do now even if we start dating someone.\u201d  His brain supplies an \u201celse\u201d that stays on Taehyung\u2019s mind only, echoing like a disturbing horror movie sound. He\u2019s got no idea why he thought that, but it\u2019s probably just a habit, from usually saying the words \u201csomeone else\u201d together. Jungkook nods within a heartbeat, and that\u2019s enough to appease Taehyung messy head. Then he looks surprised, as if he had just understood what Taehyung has said. Not what he _asked,_ but what was being said behind all that. He\u2019s smug the rest of that hellish day, as Taehyung leaves to his own bathroom to shower (not before Jungkook purposely gets toothpaste on his nose), as they prepare tea and eat before leaving, on the way to the bus stop, all the way to the subway station, Jungkook doesn\u2019t utter a word but his smile says everything",
    "Agent (2024-05-24 11:45:41.120539): The excerpt continues the intimate interaction between Jungkook and Taehyung, now with Taehyung's perspective as he reflects on how much he enjoys sleeping next to Jungkook, finding it almost addictive. Despite needing to get up for work, they easily fall back asleep for a few more minutes.\n\nTheir conversation is playful and familiar, with Taehyung teasing Jungkook about being sensitive in the mornings. However, when Taehyung jokes about sharing this information with Jungkook's future girlfriend, it leads him to an uncomfortable realization - he doesn't want Jungkook to get a girlfriend anytime soon, as it would likely mean an end to their sleepovers. \n\nWhile brushing their teeth together, Taehyung makes Jungkook promise that they'll still do everything together even if they start dating someone. The unspoken \"else\" in Taehyung's mind suggests he is grappling with unnamed feelings towards Jungkook.\n\nJungkook readily agrees, and seems to pick up on the underlying meaning behind Taehyung's request. His knowing smile for the rest of the morning hints that he understands the depth of Taehyung's attachment to him and their closeness.\n\nThe scene portrays a domestic intimacy and hints at the characters' growing awareness of their feelings for each other, even if they're not ready to openly acknowledge it yet. The warmth and ease of their interactions suggests a deep bond and potential for their relationship to develop into something more.",
    "Test (2024-05-24 11:45:41.124164): 3rd page:\n\nChapter 3  They met during college, both music students, Taehyung already a trainee at the Orchestra that Jungkook was applying for an internship. At some point, they started going to work together, then they were going to college together too, and sharing the touring road trips together, and suddenly they were\u2026 living under the same roof. It happened naturally. It was a better location, rent cheaper than they were paying before, because they could split the bills. It was only reasonable. And, well, the company was not unwelcome at all. Jungkook is a trainee now, recently graduated, so he usually arrives home first. Taehyung is a junior, and he\u2019s far from being a workaholic \u2014 that\u2019s easily a lot more like Jungkook \u2014 , but in between distractions he always comes home around eight p.m., while Jungkook is sometimes free even before six. Their roles on the Orchestra had nothing to do with their work titles \u2014 that was more salary and work hours related. Whereas Jungkook was a pianist, Taehyung played the cello. Neither of them were soloists yet, but their Orchestra was a little different than the most formal ones. This Thursday, however, Taehyung had promised to get home as soon as he could, so he could help Jungkook with the laundry. _ The laundry _ is a very specific procedure which Jungkook prefers to take care of himself. He had his own difficulties in the beginning, but by now he was quite the expert in washing machines. Well, at least with the washing machine that was  _ theirs. _  He never denied the company, however, and Taehyung could never stay still for too long, not even when he was lying down. \u201cGod, Tae, that was too much detergent.\u201d  \u201cThat\u2019s what you put the last time! I paid attention.\u201d  His forehead creases, lips pressed tightly together on a pout. \u201cYeah, and we found out that night that it was too much detergent! And we had a lot more clothes inside back then\u2026\u201d They were getting the hang of the whole house chores thing, the days where clothes would pile up until they were almost a living creature left way behind them. They exchange quizzical looks. Taehyung\u2019s smile is practically sly as he pushes the start button. \u201cWe\u2019ll have to wash it all twice. Mark my words.\u201d Jungkook sighs, defeated. \u201cWanna bet?\u201d  That makes him take a 180 degrees turn. \u201cWhat?\u201d  \u201cDinner. It\u2019s on me if you\u2019re right. You can choose.\u201d  \u201cWill we go out?\u201d  \u201cSure. Not too far, though, I know you\u2019re tired.\u201d  Jungkook shrugs. He is, and so must be Taehyung \u2014 it was a long week \u2014 , but they rarely ever go out to eat. \u201cDeal.\u201d  They deal with the first batch of clothes while the washing machine works, and soon the foam leaking out of the machinery\u2019s door is a good enough indicative that, yeah, Jungkook was right after all. Unfortunately, they only notice the foam the moment when Taehyung slips on it. It all happens in slow motion right in front of Jungkook\u2019s widened eyes. A jacket is thrown to the ceiling, Taehyung\u2019s arms reaching for any kind of support as he falls to his imminent death. Or so it looks like, which prompts Jungkook to react as fast and best as he can. That doesn\u2019t guarantee, however, that the results are anything different from the both of them falling down, weirdly tangled, but all the heads involved in the disaster are  _ safely  _ away from the floor and all the pointy corners surrounding them. \u201cOuch, my ass.\u201d  Jungkook breathes in a ridiculous amount of air. \u201cLeast it wasn\u2019t that thing attached to your neck which apparently you never use for anything at all.\u201d  \u201cHey! No need to get all aggressive on me now.\u201d  Jungkook grunts. \u201cMy back\u2026\u201d  Taehyung scrambles to get off of him, sitting up. \u201cDid you hit it somewhere? Are you hurt? I\u2013\u201d  \u201cNo",
    "Agent (2024-05-24 11:45:58.219863): This excerpt provides background on how Jungkook and Taehyung met and ended up living together. They were both music students and started working at the same orchestra, Taehyung as a cellist and Jungkook as a pianist. Their friendship developed through commuting and traveling together, eventually leading to the natural decision to become roommates for convenience and financial reasons.\n\nThe scene then shifts to a specific Thursday evening where Taehyung has come home early to help Jungkook with laundry. Their interaction while doing this household chore highlights their domestic familiarity and the learning curve of living independently. Jungkook seems to be the more meticulous one, while Taehyung is portrayed as more carefree and prone to minor mishaps, like using too much detergent.\n\nJungkook's bet about having to rewash the clothes due to excess soap leads to a playful exchange, showcasing their ease with each other and how they try to make mundane tasks more fun.\n\nWhen Taehyung slips on the leaking foam, Jungkook's protective instincts kick in as he tries to catch him, resulting in a clumsy fall with their limbs entangled. Despite the tumble, Taehyung's first concern is for Jungkook's well-being, quickly checking if he's hurt.\n\nThe passage further establishes their caring dynamic and the domestic rhythm",
    "Test (2024-05-24 11:45:58.222998): 4th page:\n\n\u201cYeah. You?\u201d   Taehyung visibly relaxes, eyes closing as his lips shape into a signature boxy-smile. \u201cYeah, thanks to you! My hero.\u201d  \u201cDon\u2019t go quoting anime on me right now.\u201d  \u201cI\u2019m only quoting because you can recognize it, otherwise I\u2019d just be  _ saying _ it. It\u2019s a normal phrase, you weeb. People say that all the time.\u201d  \u201cThe frequency and the generalization are both highly debatable. Anyway, I win.\u201d  \u201cHuh?\u201d  \u201cThe bet. I want barbecue, by the way.\u201d  \u201cHuuh?\u201d Taehyung\u2019s face gets impossibly close, closer than it was when they were literally tangled. \u201cYou\u2019re really going for my savings here, Koo.\u201d  Jungkook laughs, which grants him foam at his right cheek. Foam he never saw coming because he had a serious case of Taehyung tunnel-vision. But even after a battle with the detergent\u2019s foam\u2014there are no winners, both of them sticky and dirty \u2014 , and the shower they have to take while the washing machine works for the second time, Taehyung never mentions it again. \u201cHey, we don\u2019t really have to\u2026\u201d  \u201cShh, I was just playing with you. Barbecue is great, actually. That\u2019s what money\u2019s for, right?\u201d  Taehyung\u2019s face disappears behind a floral shirt, and they resume hanging out the clothes. \u201cEating?\u201d  The shirt wavers as he hears a chuckle. \u201cThat, too.\u201d  _ And what else? _  Jungkook waits, but Taehyung never explains himself. \t4. Chapter 4  \u201cOh, I\u2019m sorry, I have plans for tonight already.\u201d  Jiwoo\u2019s smile doesn\u2019t waver, as kind and collected as it was a moment ago, when she offered an invitation to the pub nearby, along with at least half of their musicians. \u201cWhere are you going? Perhaps we can meet at some point\u2026 just to say hi? It\u2019s a group hangout, after all.\u201d  \u201cHahah, I don\u2019t think that will happen, no, my plans involve staying in.\u201d  \u201cReally? You could do that another time, though\u2026\u201d  Has he been avoiding hanging out with his coworkers that much? No, not really, they almost never did this kind of thing, maybe that\u2019s why Jiwoo was being so forceful. However, she wasn\u2019t being invasive. Her tone was respectful and inviting. \u201cDefinitely not, no, I promised Jungkook we would do a movie marathon and eat popcorn. He\u2019s never going to forgive me if I make him leave the house instead. To a pub.\u201d  He laughs, and Jiwoo nods, tilting her head. \u201cCute.\u201d  \u201cHm?\u201d Taehyung blinks, not sure if he got it right. _Cute?_  \u201cYour friendship is really cute, you must really care about him.\u201d  \u201cOf course I do! I care about all of my friends.\u201d  Even as he says it, Taehyung feels the lie on his tongue. It tastes weird, and kind of bitter, because it isn\u2019t a lie. He\u00a0 _is_ a good friend, always has been, and he\u2019s got a pretty chunky list of people who could vow to that. But\u2026 it\u2019s a lot more than his responsibility as a friend, here. And of course, of course it is, Jungkook is a very dear friend with whom Taehyung really enjoys to spend time with. So why the hell would he cancel on Jungkook, if he actually had been waiting for their night in the whole week? He never voices that, parting ways a little awkwardly. It\u2019s like Jiwoo is waiting for something he\u2019s got no idea _what_ might be. Luckily, he doesn\u2019t dwell too long on it. Taehyung goes to the nearest market and buys ice cream too, mint chocolate flavored because it's Jungkook's favorite, and soon enough he is home. No one questioning him, only popcorn and a movie night with Jungkook ahead of him. Who would even dare to prefer a pub to this? Everything\u2019s already arranged, even if Jungkook isn\u2019t on sight",
    "Agent (2024-05-24 11:46:19.621681): In this continuation, Taehyung and Jungkook's playful dynamic is further showcased as they deal with the aftermath of the laundry mishap. Despite the mess, they maintain a lighthearted banter, with Taehyung jokingly calling Jungkook his hero and Jungkook teasing him about anime references. \n\nJungkook claims his bet victory and chooses barbecue for dinner, which leads to a brief exchange about Taehyung's finances. However, Taehyung quickly clarifies he was just joking and agrees that spending money on good food with Jungkook is worthwhile. There's a subtle hint at a deeper meaning when Jungkook agrees that's what money is for, \"that, too,\" but he doesn't elaborate further.\n\nThe scene then shifts to Taehyung's interaction with a coworker, Jiwoo, who invites him out for drinks with their fellow musicians. Taehyung declines, stating he already has plans with Jungkook for a movie night at home. \n\nJiwoo comments on how \"cute\" their friendship is, which catches Taehyung off guard. While he affirms that he cares about all his friends, he privately acknowledges there's something different and deeper in his dedication to Jungkook. He wouldn't even consider canceling their plans.\n\nTaehyung's slight discomfort with Jiwoo's observation and his own realization of how much Jungkook means to him is palpable. However, he brushes it off and focuses on getting snacks and Jungkook's favorite ice cream for their cozy evening together.\n\nThe passage further highlights the special bond between the two characters and how they prioritize each other and their time together. Taehyung's inner reflections hint at his growing awareness of feelings that go beyond simple friendship.",
    "Test (2024-05-24 11:46:19.625780): 5th page:\n\n\u201cTae?\u201dJungkook\u2019s voice comes from the kitchen, at Taehyung\u2019s left. He puts his shoes away before answering. \u201cYep.\u201d  \u201cGo shower, I\u2019m cooking lamen.\u201d  \u201cCooking, right,\u201d Taehyung teases, entering the small kitchen and going for the freezer. Jungkook stops midway what would possibly be a complain the second he sees what Taehyung is doing. \u201cIce cream? Is it ice cream?\u201d  Taehyung shrugs, hiding the package as best as he can as he stores it inside the refrigerator. \u201cIt\u2019s a surprise.\u201d  The faintest smile passes through Jungkook\u2019s frame before he fakes annoyance, furrowing his eyebrows and frowning. Taehyung sprints to his bathroom, taking the quickest shower of his entire life and rushing back to the cozy living room, where he finds Jungkook this time around, sitting surrounded by the pillows, and starring the lamen cups with big, hungry eyes. \u201cOnly four?\u201d  He points to the floor beside him, where another four lamen cups remain closed, next to a thermal jug which is probably filled with hot water. Of _course_ there was more. Taehyung sits by Jungkook\u2019s side and they start their marathon, burning their tongues and crying from the extra spice of the lamens, emptying a few water bottles before finishing six of the eight cups. It\u2019s comfortable between them, intimacy coming naturally with gentle and tender touches, even when Jungkook pokes his ribs, or Taehyung flicks his earlobe, this is even more comfortable than the nest made of pillows and blankets on the floor. There isn't much space left for the popcorn after that, but they manage. And desserts get a whole other stomach for them, Jungkook's eyes shining so brightly it almost blinds Taehyung in the darkness of their home. They eat from the pot, and Jungkook almost gets a brain freeze, saved by Taehyung physically pulling it away from his grip. The movies are dumb, zombie comedies, and they manage to get to the third one before Jungkook starts to doze off, head falling on Taehyung\u2019s shoulder. Still, he struggles against the sleep, refusing to go to bed and pretending to be awake every time Taehyung says something. He can\u2019t help but smile fondly, and discreetly try to make their position more adequate for Jungkook to sleep. They have two beds, and a perfectly good sofa, but every once in a while sleeping on the living room floor isn\u2019t that bad, either. \t5. Chapter 5  He only ever heads back home by himself if there\u2019s something waiting for him to do that can\u2019t be dealt with later. Most times, there\u2019s a lot he can do near work: groceries, bookstores, malls. The possibilities are endless, and time waiting for Taehyung is too scarce for him to even notice. Soon enough his phone chimes and it certainly is Taehyung asking if he\u2019s still around. Sometimes he heads home first, even cooks a little something for dinner\u2014Taehyung always praises his food, and Jungkook thinks he\u2019s just talking his ears off because he wants Jungkook to cook more. Either way, he can\u2019t deny that it works a _little._ And he himself thinks his food isn\u2019t half as bad as it could be. But one thing rarely changes, even during the weekends. It\u2019s almost as if Taehyung _puts him to bed._  Not literally, Jungkook isn\u2019t a kid anymore, but he is kind of an insomniac. Taehyung has his own moments, too, but Jungkook is really worse. He forgets to sleep, he doesn\u2019t notice the time passing by, and he\u2019s awful at dealing with his own insomnia. The biggest proof of that is: He has some sick playlists to help him sleep, but does he remember to use them? So the first thing that happens is: Taehyung brews him some tea. And Taehyung takes that pretty seriously\u2014he\u2019s studied all kinds of plants and herbs after the best teas he could make to help Jungkook. They are ridiculously good, too, and how Taehyung manages this is out of his comprehension",
    "Agent (2024-05-24 11:46:46.040685): This passage continues the cozy movie night scene, with Taehyung returning from his quick shower to find Jungkook surrounded by pillows and eagerly eyeing the ramen cups he's prepared. The playful banter about the quantity of food highlights their familiarity and comfort with each other.\n\nAs they settle in to watch zombie comedies, the physical intimacy between them is depicted as natural and tender, even when they poke and tease each other. The space they've created with the blankets and pillows feels like a safe, warm nest.\n\nAfter gorging on ramen, they still make room for popcorn and the mint chocolate ice cream Taehyung bought for Jungkook. Jungkook's delight at the surprise dessert is evident, his eyes shining brightly in the dim room.\n\nAs the night progresses and they start their third movie, Jungkook begins to doze off, his head resting on Taehyung's shoulder. Despite his sleepiness, he stubbornly tries to stay awake, not wanting the evening to end. Taehyung notices and adjusts their position to make Jungkook more comfortable, content to let him sleep there on the living room floor rather than moving to a bed.\n\nThe fifth chapter shifts focus to Jungkook's perspective and his after-work routine. He usually finds ways to occupy himself nearby until Taehyung is ready to head home together. On occasions when he does go back first, he often cooks dinner, spurred on by Taehyung's compliments (which he suspects are somewhat exaggerated to encourage him).\n\nA constant in their routine is how Taehyung helps Jungkook wind down for bed, especially given Jungkook's struggles with insomnia. Taehyung brews him special teas, having researched the best blends to aid sleep. Jungkook is touched by the care and effort Taehyung puts into this nightly ritual.\n\nThe domestic details and gentle consideration they show each other further underscore the depth of their bond and how intertwined their lives have become. The easy physical affection and attentiveness to each other's needs hint at the love underlying their friendship, even if it remains unspoken.",
    "Test (2024-05-24 11:46:46.051830): 6th page:\n\nHe talks about trivial things, voice serene and low, lulls Jungkook\u2019s brain into a false state of peacefulness. He\u2019s always liked Taehyung\u2019s voice, that ain\u2019t something new. Listening to it to sleep has its disadvantages\u2014that\u2019s how the dreams started\u2014, but are they really disadvantages? When the tea ends, Taehyung drags Jungkook to bed and keeps talking his ears off. Jungkook talks back, too, some times more than others, but his tongue drags heavier inside his mouth. His own voice is deeper than usual, letting his tiredness show. The tea sure has an effect, his eyelids can barely hold up, and he _likes_ to hear Taehyung talk. Taehyung can be silent for long times, and Jungkook likes that, too, but Taehyung\u2019s voice seems to make his heart overflow. Sadly, it\u2019s not always that Taehyung stays. For some reason Jungkook can\u2019t understand, he has to go to his own bed. He considers disposing of Taehyung\u2019s bed a few times, but then he would have to give up the times Taehyung invited him to his bed instead of joining in Jungkook\u2019s one, and he wasn\u2019t ready for that yet. It was nice and different when they watched a drama or anime in _Taehyung\u2019s_ bed. And Taehyung _invited_ him to stay. Jungkook liked sleeping in Taehyung\u2019s bed too, and for that to keep happening Taehyung had to have his own bed. Unfortunately. Watching anime before bed is a big no\u2014they both get way too excited, and end up sleeping way past one in the morning. That, sometimes, happens. But not much. Taehyung takes sleeping seriously, for his sake. Which is why most of the times he leaves Jungkook\u2019s bed when he thinks Jungkook is already asleep, Jungkook won\u2019t say anything. Most times, however, aren\u2019t tonight. On some rare occasions such as now, Jungkook reaches his left hand, towards Taehyung\u2019s wrist, and grabs it gently. \u201cYou\u2019re still awake?\u201d Taehyung whispers, surprised. They barely slept that Saturday, waking up to sunlight on their faces because the living room windows are big and the curtains translucent. The movie marathon the night before had Jungkook sleeping on the floor, he just didn\u2019t want it to end. \u201cBarely,\u201d he answers, not even opening his eyes. Taehyung waits in silence for a moment, then asks: \u201cYou want something?\u201d   _Stay,_ Jungkook thinks. _You don\u2019t have to go._  \u201cNah,\u201d he answers instead, suddenly way more nervous than he should be. What was he thinking? Why did he reach for Taehyung when Taehyung clearly wanted to leave? \u201c... Then?\u201d  Jungkook loosens the grip on Taehyung\u2019s wrist, pulling back. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing. Sorry.\u201d  Silence befalls the room, Taehyung isn\u2019t moving and Jungkook is definitely getting more anxious by the second. He opens his eyes at the same time Taehyung lays down again. \u201cI\u2019m staying. My job here isn\u2019t done yet.\u201d  Jungkook chuckles, closing his eyes again in a dumb attempt at hiding his embarrassment. \u201cThat\u2019s not your _job_.\u201d  \u201cHmph. Who said that?\u201d He can hear Taehyung moving closer, until his body is wrapping around Jungkook\u2019s waist, pressing his face against Taehyung\u2019s chest. \u201cThey\u2019re right, but only because I\u2019m doing this because I want to. Now, let\u2019s go to sleep, Koo. Good night.\u201d  Jungkook lets out a breath he didn\u2019t know he was holding. \u201cNight.\u201d  It\u2019s a little strangled, but Taehyung tightens the embrace and runs his fingers through Jungkook\u2019s hair, and soon enough he\u2019s not conscious enough to be nervous about anything at all. \t6",
    "Agent (2024-05-24 11:47:13.576477): In this tender scene, Taehyung's nightly ritual of helping Jungkook fall asleep is described in more detail. He brews a special tea and then talks to Jungkook in a soothing, low voice about trivial things, gradually lulling him into a peaceful state. Jungkook finds Taehyung's voice comforting and enjoys listening to him, even if it sometimes leads to certain dreams (which he doesn't seem to mind).\n\nOnce the tea is finished, Taehyung usually guides a sleepy Jungkook to bed and continues talking until he drifts off. Although Jungkook likes having Taehyung stay with him, Taehyung typically leaves for his own bed once he thinks Jungkook is asleep. Jungkook muses about getting rid of Taehyung's bed altogether but hesitates because he also cherishes the times Taehyung invites him to sleep in his bed instead.\n\nTonight, however, Jungkook reaches out and grasps Taehyung's wrist as he's about to leave, a rare occurrence. When Taehyung asks if he wants something, Jungkook thinks \"Stay\" but nervously brushes it off out loud, quickly releasing his hold.\n\nAfter a moment of silence, Taehyung surprises Jungkook by lying back down and declaring that his \"job\" isn't done yet. He wraps himself around Jungkook, holding him close and stroking his hair. Taehyung clarifies that he stays because he wants to, not out of obligation. As they settle in to sleep, Jungkook relaxes into the embrace, his nervousness fading.\n\nThis intimate moment highlights the unspoken longing and comfort they find in each other's presence. Jungkook's desire for Taehyung to stay with him, and Taehyung's willingness to do so, underscore the depth of their feelings, even if they haven't fully acknowledged them yet. The physical affection and gentle care they show each other create a sense of safety and belonging between them.",

Jungkook spaces out through most of it, dutifully pushing the shopping cart, even though he enjoys the food bits. And there are always food bits, no matter how many times they hit the market. \u201cDetergent _again_?\u201d Jungkook asks, startled to see it inside their cart. \u201cYes? Have you seen the number of dishes we make?\u201d  \u201cHave you seen the amount of _laundry_ we make? And we\u2019re not buying detergent for _that_ again.\u201d  Taehyung shakes his head, chuckling. \u201cOh, honey, that\u2019s not how this works.\u201d  Jungkook\u2019s face heats up instantly, and he focuses on hiding it instead of arguing. Taehyung must be right, he\u2019s the one who can\u2019t see a single spoon on the kitchen sink before he\u2019s doing the dishes again. A worker nearby drops one of the cans she\u2019s piling up on the bottom shelf, attracting both their eyes for a second. \u201cAnyway, last time we bought this was just a test, sometimes I\u2019m allergic to detergents. This one is good, though, and it\u2019s cheaper too, so we\u2019re buying more.\u201d  Jungkook shrugs. \u201cFair enough.\u201d  \u201cWhat else is on the list?\u201d  \u201cCereals. And eggs.\u201d  \u201cOh, this way then!\u201d  They stop when there\u2019s enough to fill four\u2014ecological\u2014bags, heading to the single counter and waiting for the cashier to come. It\u2019s a small market, a little farther from their apartment building than other markets, but Taehyung likes to support local businesses such as this one. And so does Jungkook, who also appreciates the extras they get whenever the owners are around, and the homemade treats they always have. \u201cLook, Tae, homemade melonpan!\u201d  Taehyung eyes it with curiosity. Their melonpan is his favorite. \u201cIs it fresh?\u201d  Before Jungkook can check the date, the same worker from before answers, assuming the cashier\u2019s place. \u201cYes! They were baked today.\u201d  \u201cCan we buy them? Can we, Tae?\u201d  Jungkook\u2019s eyes sparkle, as if Taehyung was ever going to deny him and he needed to resort to such a low trick. \u201cSure, you big baby.\u201d  The woman chuckles as Jungkook gets them _four_ packages, and Taehyung flicks his earlobe and messes with his hair, almost annoyed with his cuteness. \u201cHow long have you two been together, if you don\u2019t mind me asking?\u201d  Taehyung\u2019s smile fades into confusion as he stops looking at Jungkook and turns to the cashier. \u201cUh?\u201d It\u2019s Jungkook who asks, though, eyes big and curious. The cashier fumbles with the groceries, visibly flustered. \u201cUm, you two live together, right?\u201d  \u201cYeah, but\u2026\u201d  Taehyung interrupts him, throwing his arm around Jungkook\u2019s shoulders. \u201cAlmost two years, ain\u2019t it, Koo?\u201d  \u201cHuh? Tae, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s what-\u201d  Taehyung nods, turning back to her. \u201cAlmost two years now!\u201d  The woman nods, smiling shyly. \u201cYou\u2026 both seem really happy, that\u2019s all. Sorry if I stepped out of line...\u201d  \u201cNot at all! We don\u2019t really keep track of time because it\u2019s just so effortless. Time passes too fast. I am happy. Aren\u2019t you, Koo?\u201d  Jungkook nods, albeit visibly stunned. The cashier finishes helping them with their groceries, and as soon as they step out of the market, Jungkook says, very slowly:  \u201cI have no idea what just happened.\u201d  Taehyung laughs, nerves hidden by how loud he allows himself to be now that they\u2019re out in the open. \u201cMr. and Ms",
    "Agent (2024-05-24 11:47:40.314622): In this scene, Taehyung and Jungkook are out grocery shopping together, a routine task that highlights their domestic partnership. While Taehyung enjoys the process, Jungkook seems content to follow along and push the cart, only really perking up at the food samples.\n\nTheir playful banter about detergent purchases and the amount of dishes versus laundry they generate showcases their familiarity and ease with each other. When Taehyung jokingly calls Jungkook \"honey,\" it flusters him, hinting at underlying feelings.\n\nAs they finish up and head to the checkout, Jungkook's excitement over finding homemade melonpan (a type of sweet bun) is endearing. Taehyung indulges him, unable to resist Jungkook's sparkling eyes and cuteness.\n\nThe key moment occurs when the cashier innocently asks how long they've been together. While Jungkook is caught off guard, Taehyung quickly plays along, putting his arm around Jungkook and confirming they've lived together for almost two years. The cashier apologizes if she overstepped but comments on how happy they seem together. Taehyung readily agrees, stating that he is indeed happy and time feels effortless with Jungkook.\n\nOutside the store, a bewildered Jungkook admits he's not sure what just happened. Taehyung laughs, trying to hide his own nervousness at how easily he went along with the cashier's assumption that they were a couple.\n\nThis interaction brings their undefined relationship to the forefront, forcing them to confront how they may appear to others and the happiness they find in their domestic life together. Taehyung's willingness to play into the couple assumption and his genuine admission of being happy with Jungkook suggests his feelings run deeper than friendship. Jungkook's confusion and Taehyung's hidden nerves indicate they may not be ready to fully address the shift in their dynamic yet.",

Even _Min Yoongi_ is going.\u201d  \u201cThat I\u2019ll have to see with my own two eyes to believe it.\u201d  \u201cThen _wake up,_ Taehyung.\u201d  Jungkook pushes him for real this time, and Taehyung almost falls off the bed. This is why he\u2019s usually the first one to wake up, and not the other way around. As he huffs and grumbles in surprise, all Jungkook does is _laugh._  _So inconsiderate._  \u201cI was almost there!\u201d  \u201cYou\u2019ve been almost there for the past thirty minutes. Breakfast is ready, you have five minutes to get ready and move your ass to the kitchen.\u201d  \u201cHarsh.\u201d  In truth, it\u2019s really hard to wake up and get ready fast when the perspective of running a marathon is the only thing on his horizon. On a Sunday, above all. Taehyung isn\u2019t the biggest fan of running, that\u2019s all. Goddamn Hoseok and all his voluntary work. No, scratch that. Voluntary work was great, overall, but why did it have to involve _running_ of all things? \u201cHe\u00a0has to stop trying to impress Namjoon,\u201d he declares as soon as he steps in the kitchen, where Jungkook waits, playing some game on his smartphone. \u201cHm? Isn\u2019t Joon and Jimin a thing?\u201d  \u201cWhat? !\u201d  \u201cYeah, I thought everyone knew?\u201d  \u201cHow did _you_ find that out?\u201d  \u201c... Anyway, Yoongi is the one trying to impress someone.\u201d  \u201c _What_?\u201d  Jungkook laughs, pretending to be too busy with his game to reply as Taehyung eats his cereal. Is everyone on their orchestra group of friends dating or _interested_ in dating someone? That\u2019s just absurd. Yeah, they\u2019re all pretty cute, yes, but dating? A relationship? It just sounds\u2026 No, Taehyung can\u2019t see that. _Wait._ But what about Jungkook? \u201cSo\u2026\u201d He starts, instantly earning a glare from Jungkook. In turn, he apparently dies in the game he was playing, so Taehyung gets more than two seconds of his attention. \u201cHave _you_ got your eyes on anyone?\u201d  Jungkook coughs like he\u2019s choked on something, perhaps air. \u201cWhat?\u201d  \u201cEveryone\u2019s dating or something, apparently. I thought you might\u2019ve been, too?\u201d  \u201cNo. _No,_ \u201d Jungkook repeats, with extra emphasis. \u201cNot dating?\u201d  \u201cNo.\u201d  \u201cNot even any crushes?\u201d  \u201cWe should get going.\u201d  \u201cOh?\u201d He looks down at his bowl, finding it still half-full. \u201cBut I\u2019m not finished. Koo-\u201d  He drinks it in a hurry, praying it won\u2019t be too bad for his stomach, and rushes to the front door where Jungkook awaits still looking flustered. Or mad, because they\u2019re late? Or both. The marathon isn\u2019t too far, but they need to catch a bus first. Still, they\u2019re pretty on time\u2014Hoseok compliments their punctuality and Taehyung raises an eyebrow at Jungkook, who simply ignores him. It\u2019s not as bad as it seemed to be now that they\u2019re here. It\u2019s a nice day, not cold but not hot either, and of Taehyung manages to take it easy, he\u2019s positive he can reach the finish line. He does the stretching carefully, with Jungkook\u2019s help. Jungkook is probably ending the marathon in first place, the way he\u2019s always exercising around the apartment and going out for night or morning runs at ass o\u2019clock. He even looks like a natural, like he\u2019s a part of this environment instead of one of the people brought by a friend. He goes around helping everyone he can, morning sunlight hitting the most prominent features of his face and catching Taehyung\u2019s eyes. Taehyung squints, but doesn\u2019t look away",
    "Agent (2024-05-24 11:48:01.406679): In this chapter, Jungkook is trying to wake Taehyung up on a Sunday morning to attend a marathon they promised their friend Hoseok they would participate in. Taehyung is reluctant, not being a fan of running, and complains that Hoseok is only doing this to impress Namjoon. \n\nJungkook surprises Taehyung by revealing that Namjoon and Jimin are actually a couple, and that it's Yoongi who is trying to impress someone. This leads to Taehyung wondering if Jungkook himself is interested in anyone, catching Jungkook off guard.\n\nWhen asked directly, Jungkook firmly denies dating anyone or even having a crush, and seems flustered or annoyed by the questioning. He hurries Taehyung to finish his breakfast so they can leave, perhaps to avoid the topic.\n\nAt the marathon, Hoseok compliments their punctuality, and Taehyung notes that it's not as bad as he anticipated. As they stretch and prepare, Taehyung observes Jungkook, who seems in his element. He moves naturally, helping others and looking at ease in the environment. \n\nTaehyung finds himself staring at Jungkook, the morning light highlighting his features. Even when he squints against the brightness, Taehyung can't seem to look away, hinting at his growing attraction and awareness of Jungkook in a new light.\n\nThe interaction about dating and crushes, along with Jungkook's flustered reaction, suggests an underlying tension and uncertainty about their own relationship. Taehyung's inability to tear his gaze away from Jungkook further underscores the shift in his feelings, even if he's not fully ready to acknowledge it yet.",
    "Test (2024-05-24 11:48:01.410587): 9th page:\n\nJungkook is sitting at the sidewalk by his side, smiling from ear to ear like he\u2019s not anywhere close to imminent death. \u201cMy legs were burning, Jungkook. _Burning._ And I\u2019m not exaggerating.\u201d  His hair is dripping sweat, and it shouldn\u2019t be _cute_ , but it\u2019s Jungkook. \u201cBut you did it! Imagine if you had some practice.\u201d  Taehyung lets out a weak snarl, lacking any bite to it. \u201cI\u2019d rather just keep watching you doing your routines around the house, thanks.\u201d  If Jungkook blushes, it\u2019s well hidden by the exercising blush that\u2019s still there. \u201cC\u2019mon, Tae. It was way better running along with you than it is running by myself every day. I\u2019ll keep up with you, and we don\u2019t have to go every day. _Please._ \u201d  That\u2019s true. Jungkook had kept his pace throughout the whole marathon, and that was probably why Taehyung had actually crossed the finish line. It was just impossible to resist Jungkook\u2019s puppy eyes. It was a trap all along, and Taehyung should have known it. \u201cFine.\u201d  Jungkook\u2019s face lights up instantly, and Taehyung almost feels good with himself for being the cause for his euphoria. A blond drops by Jungkook\u2019s side at the crosswalk, offering Taehyung a cold water bottle. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t even that hard.\u201d  And, truly, he\u2019s barely breaking any sweat. In fact, Yoongi looks almost _exactly_ like he did right before the marathon. Jungkook only chuckles by his side, and something clicks inside Taehyung\u2019s head. \u201cBastard. You called a taxi, didn\u2019t you?\u201d  Yoongi feigns innocence and utter bafflement. \u201cI would _never_ think of something like that.\u201d \t8. Chapter 8  The one thing Jungkook always tried to avoid was a matter of principle. Borrowing clothes from Taehyung was completely out of line. Because he had feelings Taehyung wasn\u2019t aware of, and he could never wear even a t-shirt from Taehyung without feeling stupidly giddy about it. This self-imposed rule only made him really good at having a tight schedule for their laundries. However. The weather was something Jungkook couldn\u2019t control just yet, and walking around the apartment without a t-shirt? That is fine. Going out in the cold weather without a hoodie? Well, that\u2019s just not as fine. Luckily, Jungkook wouldn\u2019t have to leave the house before his hoodies were all dry and ready to go, because it was still Sunday. \u201cOkay, we have like\u2026 six clothing items, together.\u201d Taehyung states, scientifically. \u201cI\u2019ll just stay under the blankets the whole day.\u201d  Taehyung chuckles, leaning into him. It makes everything inside Jungkook lights up, but he does his best to remain still. \u201cDon\u2019t be dumb, you should wear this.\u201d   And maybe it\u2019s because the specific item of clothing is so unexpected that Jungkook\u2019s brain comes to a halt, but he can\u2019t deny it. He ends up promptly accepting the pastel yellow crop top (crop top???) with long sleeves and then it\u2019s too late to deny it. Taehyung is happily singsonging to his favorite song (at the moment) and waltzing away from the laundry room, and Jungkook tries the crop top on  _ just because. _ It has their laundry\u2019s smell, after all, it shouldn\u2019t be that dangerous. \u2026 Except for the fact that he can\u2019t stop imagining Taehyung wearing this exact piece of clothing. When? In which context? Why hadn\u2019t Jungkook heard  _ anything  _ about this? They literally _ lived together. _  He can t deny the clothing item is fairly comfortable, and wearing nothing isn\u2019t exactly appalling when it\u2019s almost snowing outside. Even when their heating system is working just fine",

Despite his exhaustion and burning legs, Jungkook's presence and enthusiasm make the experience more bearable. Jungkook even convinces Taehyung to start running together regularly, promising to keep pace with him. Taehyung agrees, unable to resist Jungkook's pleading puppy eyes.\n\nWhen their friend Yoongi joins them, looking suspiciously fresh for someone who just ran a marathon, Taehyung jokingly accuses him of taking a taxi instead. Yoongi playfully denies it, showcasing the friendly, teasing dynamic among the group.\n\nThe scene then shifts to Jungkook's perspective, revealing his self-imposed rule of never borrowing clothes from Taehyung. This stems from his secret feelings for Taehyung and the giddy emotions that wearing Taehyung's clothes would evoke. To avoid this, Jungkook is diligent about their laundry schedule.\n\nHowever, due to unexpected weather and a shortage of clean hoodies, Jungkook finds himself in a predicament. Taehyung casually offers him a pastel yellow crop top with long sleeves to wear instead. Caught off guard, Jungkook accepts it before he can think twice.\n\nAs Taehyung happily goes about his business, Jungkook tries on the crop top and is surprised by how comfortable it is. However, he can't stop imagining Taehyung wearing it and wonders about the context in which he did. The fact that he hadn't known about this article of clothing, despite living together, intrigues and flusters him.\n\nThis scene highlights the growing intimacy and comfort between the characters, with Taehyung easily offering his clothes to Jungkook. At the same time, it underscores Jungkook's hidden feelings and the way small gestures, like wearing Taehyung's top, affect him deeply. The crop top itself adds a playful, unexpected element to their dynamics, hinting at aspects of Taehyung that Jungkook is still discovering.",

    "Test (2024-05-24 11:48:51.382735): 11th and last page:\n\nTaehyung obliviously poses with his back turned to the mirror, hand resting on Jungkook\u2019s left shoulder, their chests almost pressed together, and it takes everything inside him not to embrace Taehyung\u2019s waist on a hug and sink his face on Taehyung\u2019s neck, hiding how flustered he is, but also how content he feels. Something changes right there and then, and Jungkook mentally sighs. This is why there was a rule, and he should have never borrowed any piece of clothing from Taehyung. He was still wearing the yellow crop top under his hoodie, even though it wasn't to show off, it was there, and he knew it, and that was why he was wearing it, despite whatever Taehyung thought it was. Now, there was  _ no  _ turning back.",
    "Agent (2024-05-24 11:49:16.208981): In this final scene, Taehyung continues to pose with Jungkook's varsity jacket in the restroom mirror, oblivious to the effect it's having on Jungkook. As Taehyung leans close, hand on Jungkook's shoulder and their chests nearly touching, Jungkook struggles to control his emotions. He's tempted to wrap his arms around Taehyung's waist and bury his face in his neck, both to hide his flustered state and to express his contentment.\n\nThis moment marks a significant shift in Jungkook's perspective. He realizes that his self-imposed rule about not borrowing Taehyung's clothes was a form of self-preservation, an attempt to keep his feelings in check. By wearing Taehyung's crop top under his hoodie, even if it's hidden, Jungkook has crossed a line he can't come back from.\n\nThe intimate proximity and Taehyung's casual affection force Jungkook to confront the depth of his emotions. He mentally acknowledges that there's no turning back now, implying that he can no longer deny or suppress his love for Taehyung.\n\nThis final scene leaves the reader with a sense of anticipation, wondering how Jungkook will navigate his newfound acceptance of his feelings and whether Taehyung will come to realize the true nature of their bond. The open-ended conclusion suggests that their relationship is on the cusp of a significant change, with the potential for a romantic future if they can overcome their hesitations and openly express their love for each other.\n\nThroughout the excerpt, the author has skillfully explored the tension, tenderness, and unspoken emotions between Jungkook and Taehyung, creating a compelling narrative of friends on the verge of becoming something more. The domestic scenes, playful banter, and subtle gestures all contribute to the building of their relationship, making the reader invested in their journey and hopeful for a happy resolution to their story.",

Someone said Jungkook didn't like kisses, neither giving or receiving them, and Taehyung scoffed and said Jungkook also didn't happen to like hugs, and **still** , Taehyung could hug him whenever he felt like it. \"So kiss him, then.\" Jimin provoked. Taehyung did. On Jungkook's right cheek, for whole three seconds and a half. Yes, Jungkook did count. He couldn't breathe for the whole thing, but right after it he put his tongue out for his friends, walking away as Taehyung puffed his chest looking very proud of himself. Jungkook laughed when he was at a safe distance, thinking of Taehyung showing off like a peacock for being allowed to kiss Jungkook's cheek. He was so dumb. And _endearing._  That's why he could get away with everything, although back then Jungkook wasn't aware of that. Not fully. Jimin looked quite full of himself, later. He had no idea why.",

That\u2019s not enough to put Jungkook at ease\u2014the weather change was really unexpected, and he knows too damn well just how susceptible to them Taehyung is. While Jungkook\u2019s been dealing with his allergies throughout his whole life, Taehyung rarely ever gets sick. He\u2019s got iron immunity, superhero worthy, but every time Taehyung does get sick, it\u2019s official hospital visiting hours. Even his colds look like a new damn virus just got brought into the world. Maybe Jungkook is a little too impressionable, maybe he\u2019s worrying too much. However, as long as there\u2019s a probability he could be even remotely right, he\u2019s not going to change. Luckily so, because this time turns out to be one of the few times he\u2019s actually right, and when Taehyung almost passes out while standing, Jungkook is right here to catch him.",

Always the timing. \u201cI\u2019m going to die,\u201d Jungkook states, and Taehyung knows it\u2019s not drama because he feels it too.

It\u2019s perfect.\u201d  Jungkook\u2019s eyes beg for mercy, and they both know what Taehyung said is true, but they both also know that their families coming over for an early birthday celebration isn\u2019t what _rest_ is.",

It's a good thing he was born on the last days of the year, that way his birthday always mixes up with New Year's Eve and he convinces everyone to do something else. Something nice, nothing like a birthday party, mind you. Jungkook used to keep tabs on special dates, for a good time, until he realized it was dumb and meaningless. Of course, if you were giving it meaning, then it meant something. But what he found out was that he, in fact, enjoyed a lot more spontaneous acts of affection. And, even knowing this, Taehyung bought him the pair of jacket and pants he had been eyeing for weeks.",

    "Test (2024-05-24 11:45:10.205871): 1st page:\n\n\t1. Thoughts keep getting tangled in my head    This is a side of him that no one\u2019s ever seen. It\u2019s true for Taehyung too, but even more so for himself. It\u2019s not like he hasn\u2019t slept over friend\u2019s houses, or no one else has ever seen him sleeping before. But this. This is different. The light coming from the window is usually scarce, because Jungkook doesn\u2019t like waking up with the sun in his eyes, nor does Taehyung. However, the night before Taehyung had insisted that they should watch the stars together, because he\u2019s been studying them and he wanted to show everything he had learned to Jungkook as well. (Jungkook was studying them too, because he was really curious about things, especially things Taehyung was curious about, but he enjoyed to listen to Taehyung talk as if he was teaching him from scratch, his observations and words always beautiful and way more interesting than the ones Jungkook had read on the internet.) So, this time around, Taehyung\u2019s face is clear and bright under the morning light, the slope of his nose highlighted, each and every mole apparent, lips puffed and slightly parted, face squished against the pillow by Jungkook\u2019s side on Jungkook\u2019s bed. And Jungkook stares, because he\u2019s not fully awake just yet. He takes a while to wake up, always have, and therefore there\u2019s nothing to stop him from staring. Even blinking comes slow and lazily, and that has nothing to do with the fact he\u2019s a little hypnotized by the view. It\u2019s just how it is. How things are. How he is. Hopefully, how they are. It\u2019s simply not a step he\u2019s willing to take. Not right now. A step bigger than his legs are, that\u2019s what it feels like. He wants to reach for it, oh, Jungkook does. But that might scare Taehyung away. Taehyung isn\u2019t ready for that just yet. And that\u2019s really fine. Just, moments like this, under the rising sun, on his bed, by Taehyung\u2019s side, this feels all too different. Too beautiful, too good, too much. His chest aches, then, for something. A warmth. Someone. A proximity lacking, and he needs it then, as if his life depends on it, his chest is pulling Taehyung to him, begging, screaming, heart threatening to burst through if Jungkook doesn\u2019t do something, anything. Maybe it works, and the thing inside his chest is so strong that it manages to make Taehyung stir in his sleep, and literally roll to Jungkook\u2019s side. Or it\u2019s just Taehyung, being Taehyung, and squishing his face into Jungkook\u2019s chest is just way better than any pillow could ever be. He sighs in contentment, sinking further into Jungkook\u2019s aching chest, and in a moment it\u2019s like there was never any pain there, to begin with. I must be going crazy, is what Jungkook thinks, breathing through his nose as slowly and quietly as he can. \u201c\u2018Mmnornin, Koo.\u201d  A heartbeat\u2014one Taehyung certainly hears, left ear pressed against Jungkook\u2019s heart\u2014and a soft smile on Jungkook\u2019s lips as he replies, voice hoarse from sleep:  \u201cGood morning, Taetae.\u201d  And Jungkook is glad he gets to wake up like this a bunch of days. Because this. This is special. On other days he wakes up with a punch to the stomach, yeah, sometimes even with a pair of feet resting way too close to his face, but still. Still, this isn\u2019t something he\u2019d ever trade. \t2. Chapter 2  The bad thing about sleeping with Jungkook is the one thing that shouldn\u2019t be bad at all about sleeping. Only, it\u2019s 7h10 and Taehyung really needs to wake up, really needs to get ready to work, really needs to _get out of bed._  But capitalism. As Yoongi said, capitalism ruined the simplest, most beautiful thing ever. Sleep",
    "Agent (2024-05-24 11:45:24.121153): It seems like you've read me an excerpt from a fictional story or novel, depicting an intimate moment between two characters named Jungkook and Taehyung as they wake up together one morning. The passage describes Jungkook's internal thoughts and feelings as he gazes at a sleeping Taehyung in the morning light, hinting at deeper romantic feelings he holds for his friend that he is hesitant to act on. \n\nThe writing has a tender, introspective tone as it explores the closeness and comfort between the two characters. There are references to them often sleeping over at each other's places, but this particular morning feeling different and special to Jungkook.\n\nThe second part seems to shift to Taehyung's perspective, lamenting having to get up for work when he would rather stay sleeping next to Jungkook, with a humorous reference to their friend Yoongi's views on capitalism.\n\nWithout more context it's hard to say much else, but the passage establishes a close, affectionate relationship between the two main characters with the potential for romance.

Because it _is_ addicting. Once he found his way into Jungkook\u2019s bed, it was really hard to resist the urge of inviting himself in every night. He only did it for the sake of Jungkook not getting tired of him, and throwing him out of their shared apartment. \u201cKoo, we gotta wake up now.\u201d  Jungkook mumbles this time, maybe they took a ten minutes nap from the moment they exchanged good mornings. It happens frequently. Taehyung pokes his ribs, rather carefully, but the location guarantees an immediate reaction. The body under him moved, and Taehyung looks up to find an angry look pointed down at his face. \u201cMust you hurt me in order to wake me up, Taehyung?\u201d  \u201cYeah. Otherwise, you never do, not as fast as we need you to, at least. Plus, that didn\u2019t really hurt, you\u2019re just being a baby.\u201d  \u201cIt hurt. I\u2019m very sensitive when I wake up.\u201d  Taehyung almost beams at the slip-up, his day already made when his lips part and he pronounces very attentively:  \u201cOh?\u201d  Jungkook is torn between blushing and grunting, and that gets a pillow smashed into Taehyung\u2019s face. \u201cWhy are you like this?\u201d He rolls out of bed, maybe suppressing his laughter. Taehyung giggles, getting up too. \u201cThis is an important piece of information, Koo, I can tell your future girlfriend about it, and that\u2019s gonna be good for you later.\u201d  He winks, and Jungkook visibly rolls his eyes. \u201cYeah, and she wouldn\u2019t find it suspicious at all that you somehow seem to have this important piece of information.\u201d  Taehyung realizes\u00a0a lot of things at once, but the most important one is that Jungkook shouldn\u2019t get a girlfriend anytime soon. That would mean the end of their nights sleeping together. He feels too selfish to actually say that out loud, so he moved to the bathroom instead, Jungkook\u2019s bathroom, and grabbed his toothbrush, his extra toothbrush that has been used more times than his actual toothbrush, almost forgotten at his own bathroom. Still, Jungkook is too attentive to let something like this pass by unnoticed, his eyes are careful on Taehyung and some of the hairs on his nape bristle as an effect. Jungkook walks to his side and grabs his own toothbrush. \u201cWhat?\u201d  Taehyung stops brushing. \u201cPromise me one thing.\u201d  \u201cHuh?\u201d  \u201cJust say you\u2019ll promise me one thing.\u201d  Jungkook looks down to his toothbrush as he puts on some toothpaste. \u201cThat\u2019s already a promise, Tae.\u201d  \u201cWhatever. Then promise twice.\u201d  Jungkook smiles, rather softly. \u201cYeah, okay.\u201d  \u201cHm. Good.\u201d Taehyung takes the toothbrush off his mouth, and lowers himself to spit on the sink. When he rises again, Jungkook is brushing his teeth, waiting only mildly curiously. \u201cThen promise we\u2019ll still do everything we do now even if we start dating someone.\u201d  His brain supplies an \u201celse\u201d that stays on Taehyung\u2019s mind only, echoing like a disturbing horror movie sound. He\u2019s got no idea why he thought that, but it\u2019s probably just a habit, from usually saying the words \u201csomeone else\u201d together. Jungkook nods within a heartbeat, and that\u2019s enough to appease Taehyung messy head. Then he looks surprised, as if he had just understood what Taehyung has said. Not what he _asked,_ but what was being said behind all that. He\u2019s smug the rest of that hellish day, as Taehyung leaves to his own bathroom to shower (not before Jungkook purposely gets toothpaste on his nose), as they prepare tea and eat before leaving, on the way to the bus stop, all the way to the subway station, Jungkook doesn\u2019t utter a word but his smile says everything",
    "Agent (2024-05-24 11:45:41.120539): The excerpt continues the intimate interaction between Jungkook and Taehyung, now with Taehyung's perspective as he reflects on how much he enjoys sleeping next to Jungkook, finding it almost addictive. Despite needing to get up for work, they easily fall back asleep for a few more minutes.\n\nTheir conversation is playful and familiar, with Taehyung teasing Jungkook about being sensitive in the mornings. However, when Taehyung jokes about sharing this information with Jungkook's future girlfriend, it leads him to an uncomfortable realization - he doesn't want Jungkook to get a girlfriend anytime soon, as it would likely mean an end to their sleepovers. \n\nWhile brushing their teeth together, Taehyung makes Jungkook promise that they'll still do everything together even if they start dating someone. The unspoken \"else\" in Taehyung's mind suggests he is grappling with unnamed feelings towards Jungkook.\n\nJungkook readily agrees, and seems to pick up on the underlying meaning behind Taehyung's request. His knowing smile for the rest of the morning hints that he understands the depth of Taehyung's attachment to him and their closeness.\n\nThe scene portrays a domestic intimacy and hints at the characters' growing awareness of their feelings for each other, even if they're not ready to openly acknowledge it yet. The warmth and ease of their interactions suggests a deep bond and potential for their relationship to develop into something more.",
    "Test (2024-05-24 11:45:41.124164): 3rd page:\n\nChapter 3  They met during college, both music students, Taehyung already a trainee at the Orchestra that Jungkook was applying for an internship. At some point, they started going to work together, then they were going to college together too, and sharing the touring road trips together, and suddenly they were\u2026 living under the same roof. It happened naturally. It was a better location, rent cheaper than they were paying before, because they could split the bills. It was only reasonable. And, well, the company was not unwelcome at all. Jungkook is a trainee now, recently graduated, so he usually arrives home first. Taehyung is a junior, and he\u2019s far from being a workaholic \u2014 that\u2019s easily a lot more like Jungkook \u2014 , but in between distractions he always comes home around eight p.m., while Jungkook is sometimes free even before six. Their roles on the Orchestra had nothing to do with their work titles \u2014 that was more salary and work hours related. Whereas Jungkook was a pianist, Taehyung played the cello. Neither of them were soloists yet, but their Orchestra was a little different than the most formal ones. This Thursday, however, Taehyung had promised to get home as soon as he could, so he could help Jungkook with the laundry. _ The laundry _ is a very specific procedure which Jungkook prefers to take care of himself. He had his own difficulties in the beginning, but by now he was quite the expert in washing machines. Well, at least with the washing machine that was  _ theirs. _  He never denied the company, however, and Taehyung could never stay still for too long, not even when he was lying down. \u201cGod, Tae, that was too much detergent.\u201d  \u201cThat\u2019s what you put the last time! I paid attention.\u201d  His forehead creases, lips pressed tightly together on a pout. \u201cYeah, and we found out that night that it was too much detergent! And we had a lot more clothes inside back then\u2026\u201d They were getting the hang of the whole house chores thing, the days where clothes would pile up until they were almost a living creature left way behind them. They exchange quizzical looks. Taehyung\u2019s smile is practically sly as he pushes the start button. \u201cWe\u2019ll have to wash it all twice. Mark my words.\u201d Jungkook sighs, defeated. \u201cWanna bet?\u201d  That makes him take a 180 degrees turn. \u201cWhat?\u201d  \u201cDinner. It\u2019s on me if you\u2019re right. You can choose.\u201d  \u201cWill we go out?\u201d  \u201cSure. Not too far, though, I know you\u2019re tired.\u201d  Jungkook shrugs. He is, and so must be Taehyung \u2014 it was a long week \u2014 , but they rarely ever go out to eat. \u201cDeal.\u201d  They deal with the first batch of clothes while the washing machine works, and soon the foam leaking out of the machinery\u2019s door is a good enough indicative that, yeah, Jungkook was right after all. Unfortunately, they only notice the foam the moment when Taehyung slips on it. It all happens in slow motion right in front of Jungkook\u2019s widened eyes. A jacket is thrown to the ceiling, Taehyung\u2019s arms reaching for any kind of support as he falls to his imminent death. Or so it looks like, which prompts Jungkook to react as fast and best as he can. That doesn\u2019t guarantee, however, that the results are anything different from the both of them falling down, weirdly tangled, but all the heads involved in the disaster are  _ safely  _ away from the floor and all the pointy corners surrounding them. \u201cOuch, my ass.\u201d  Jungkook breathes in a ridiculous amount of air. \u201cLeast it wasn\u2019t that thing attached to your neck which apparently you never use for anything at all.\u201d  \u201cHey! No need to get all aggressive on me now.\u201d  Jungkook grunts. \u201cMy back\u2026\u201d  Taehyung scrambles to get off of him, sitting up. \u201cDid you hit it somewhere? Are you hurt?

They were both music students and started working at the same orchestra, Taehyung as a cellist and Jungkook as a pianist. Their friendship developed through commuting and traveling together, eventually leading to the natural decision to become roommates for convenience and financial reasons.\n\nThe scene then shifts to a specific Thursday evening where Taehyung has come home early to help Jungkook with laundry. Their interaction while doing this household chore highlights their domestic familiarity and the learning curve of living independently. Jungkook seems to be the more meticulous one, while Taehyung is portrayed as more carefree and prone to minor mishaps, like using too much detergent.\n\nJungkook's bet about having to rewash the clothes due to excess soap leads to a playful exchange, showcasing their ease with each other and how they try to make mundane tasks more fun.\n\nWhen Taehyung slips on the leaking foam, Jungkook's protective instincts kick in as he tries to catch him, resulting in a clumsy fall with their limbs entangled. Despite the tumble, Taehyung's first concern is for Jungkook's well-being, quickly checking if he's hurt.\n\nThe passage further establishes their caring dynamic and the domestic rhythm",

It\u2019s a normal phrase, you weeb. People say that all the time.\u201d  \u201cThe frequency and the generalization are both highly debatable. Anyway, I win.\u201d  \u201cHuh?\u201d  \u201cThe bet. I want barbecue, by the way.\u201d  \u201cHuuh?\u201d Taehyung\u2019s face gets impossibly close, closer than it was when they were literally tangled. \u201cYou\u2019re really going for my savings here, Koo.\u201d  Jungkook laughs, which grants him foam at his right cheek. Foam he never saw coming because he had a serious case of Taehyung tunnel-vision. But even after a battle with the detergent\u2019s foam\u2014there are no winners, both of them sticky and dirty \u2014 , and the shower they have to take while the washing machine works for the second time, Taehyung never mentions it again. \u201cHey, we don\u2019t really have to\u2026\u201d  \u201cShh, I was just playing with you. Barbecue is great, actually. That\u2019s what money\u2019s for, right?\u201d  Taehyung\u2019s face disappears behind a floral shirt, and they resume hanging out the clothes. \u201cEating?\u201d  The shirt wavers as he hears a chuckle. \u201cThat, too.\u201d  _ And what else? _  Jungkook waits, but Taehyung never explains himself. \t4. Chapter 4  \u201cOh, I\u2019m sorry, I have plans for tonight already.\u201d  Jiwoo\u2019s smile doesn\u2019t waver, as kind and collected as it was a moment ago, when she offered an invitation to the pub nearby, along with at least half of their musicians. \u201cWhere are you going? Perhaps we can meet at some point\u2026 just to say hi? It\u2019s a group hangout, after all.\u201d  \u201cHahah, I don\u2019t think that will happen, no, my plans involve staying in.\u201d  \u201cReally? You could do that another time, though\u2026\u201d  Has he been avoiding hanging out with his coworkers that much? No, not really, they almost never did this kind of thing, maybe that\u2019s why Jiwoo was being so forceful. However, she wasn\u2019t being invasive. Her tone was respectful and inviting. \u201cDefinitely not, no, I promised Jungkook we would do a movie marathon and eat popcorn. He\u2019s never going to forgive me if I make him leave the house instead. To a pub.\u201d  He laughs, and Jiwoo nods, tilting her head. \u201cCute.\u201d  \u201cHm?\u201d Taehyung blinks, not sure if he got it right. _Cute?_  \u201cYour friendship is really cute, you must really care about him.\u201d  \u201cOf course I do! I care about all of my friends.\u201d  Even as he says it, Taehyung feels the lie on his tongue. It tastes weird, and kind of bitter, because it isn\u2019t a lie. He\u00a0 _is_ a good friend, always has been, and he\u2019s got a pretty chunky list of people who could vow to that. But\u2026 it\u2019s a lot more than his responsibility as a friend, here. And of course, of course it is, Jungkook is a very dear friend with whom Taehyung really enjoys to spend time with. So why the hell would he cancel on Jungkook, if he actually had been waiting for their night in the whole week? He never voices that, parting ways a little awkwardly. It\u2019s like Jiwoo is waiting for something he\u2019s got no idea _what_ might be. Luckily, he doesn\u2019t dwell too long on it. Taehyung goes to the nearest market and buys ice cream too, mint chocolate flavored because it's Jungkook's favorite, and soon enough he is home. No one questioning him, only popcorn and a movie night with Jungkook ahead of him. Who would even dare to prefer a pub to this? Everything\u2019s already arranged, even if Jungkook isn\u2019t on sight",

Despite the mess, they maintain a lighthearted banter, with Taehyung jokingly calling Jungkook his hero and Jungkook teasing him about anime references. \n\nJungkook claims his bet victory and chooses barbecue for dinner, which leads to a brief exchange about Taehyung's finances. However, Taehyung quickly clarifies he was just joking and agrees that spending money on good food with Jungkook is worthwhile. There's a subtle hint at a deeper meaning when Jungkook agrees that's what money is for, \"that, too,\" but he doesn't elaborate further.\n\nThe scene then shifts to Taehyung's interaction with a coworker, Jiwoo, who invites him out for drinks with their fellow musicians. Taehyung declines, stating he already has plans with Jungkook for a movie night at home. \n\nJiwoo comments on how \"cute\" their friendship is, which catches Taehyung off guard. While he affirms that he cares about all his friends, he privately acknowledges there's something different and deeper in his dedication to Jungkook. He wouldn't even consider canceling their plans.\n\nTaehyung's slight discomfort with Jiwoo's observation and his own realization of how much Jungkook means to him is palpable. However, he brushes it off and focuses on getting snacks and Jungkook's favorite ice cream for their cozy evening together.\n\nThe passage further highlights the special bond between the two characters and how they prioritize each other and their time together.

He puts his shoes away before answering. \u201cYep.\u201d  \u201cGo shower, I\u2019m cooking lamen.\u201d  \u201cCooking, right,\u201d Taehyung teases, entering the small kitchen and going for the freezer. Jungkook stops midway what would possibly be a complain the second he sees what Taehyung is doing. \u201cIce cream? Is it ice cream?\u201d  Taehyung shrugs, hiding the package as best as he can as he stores it inside the refrigerator. \u201cIt\u2019s a surprise.\u201d  The faintest smile passes through Jungkook\u2019s frame before he fakes annoyance, furrowing his eyebrows and frowning. Taehyung sprints to his bathroom, taking the quickest shower of his entire life and rushing back to the cozy living room, where he finds Jungkook this time around, sitting surrounded by the pillows, and starring the lamen cups with big, hungry eyes. \u201cOnly four?\u201d  He points to the floor beside him, where another four lamen cups remain closed, next to a thermal jug which is probably filled with hot water. Of _course_ there was more. Taehyung sits by Jungkook\u2019s side and they start their marathon, burning their tongues and crying from the extra spice of the lamens, emptying a few water bottles before finishing six of the eight cups. It\u2019s comfortable between them, intimacy coming naturally with gentle and tender touches, even when Jungkook pokes his ribs, or Taehyung flicks his earlobe, this is even more comfortable than the nest made of pillows and blankets on the floor. There isn't much space left for the popcorn after that, but they manage. And desserts get a whole other stomach for them, Jungkook's eyes shining so brightly it almost blinds Taehyung in the darkness of their home. They eat from the pot, and Jungkook almost gets a brain freeze, saved by Taehyung physically pulling it away from his grip. The movies are dumb, zombie comedies, and they manage to get to the third one before Jungkook starts to doze off, head falling on Taehyung\u2019s shoulder. Still, he struggles against the sleep, refusing to go to bed and pretending to be awake every time Taehyung says something. He can\u2019t help but smile fondly, and discreetly try to make their position more adequate for Jungkook to sleep. They have two beds, and a perfectly good sofa, but every once in a while sleeping on the living room floor isn\u2019t that bad, either. \t5. Chapter 5  He only ever heads back home by himself if there\u2019s something waiting for him to do that can\u2019t be dealt with later. Most times, there\u2019s a lot he can do near work: groceries, bookstores, malls. The possibilities are endless, and time waiting for Taehyung is too scarce for him to even notice. Soon enough his phone chimes and it certainly is Taehyung asking if he\u2019s still around. Sometimes he heads home first, even cooks a little something for dinner\u2014Taehyung always praises his food, and Jungkook thinks he\u2019s just talking his ears off because he wants Jungkook to cook more. Either way, he can\u2019t deny that it works a _little._ And he himself thinks his food isn\u2019t half as bad as it could be. But one thing rarely changes, even during the weekends. It\u2019s almost as if Taehyung _puts him to bed._  Not literally, Jungkook isn\u2019t a kid anymore, but he is kind of an insomniac. Taehyung has his own moments, too, but Jungkook is really worse. He forgets to sleep, he doesn\u2019t notice the time passing by, and he\u2019s awful at dealing with his own insomnia. The biggest proof of that is: He has some sick playlists to help him sleep, but does he remember to use them? So the first thing that happens is: Taehyung brews him some tea. And Taehyung takes that pretty seriously\u2014he\u2019s studied all kinds of plants and herbs after the best teas he could make to help Jungkook. They are ridiculously good, too, and how Taehyung manages this is out of his comprehension",
    "Agent (2024-05-24 11:46:46.040685): This passage continues the cozy movie night scene, with Taehyung returning from his quick shower to find Jungkook surrounded by pillows and eagerly eyeing the ramen cups he's prepared. The playful banter about the quantity of food highlights their familiarity and comfort with each other.\n\nAs they settle in to watch zombie comedies, the physical intimacy between them is depicted as natural and tender, even when they poke and tease each other. The space they've created with the blankets and pillows feels like a safe, warm nest.\n\nAfter gorging on ramen, they still make room for popcorn and the mint chocolate ice cream Taehyung bought for Jungkook. Jungkook's delight at the surprise dessert is evident, his eyes shining brightly in the dim room.\n\nAs the night progresses and they start their third movie, Jungkook begins to doze off, his head resting on Taehyung's shoulder. Despite his sleepiness, he stubbornly tries to stay awake, not wanting the evening to end. Taehyung notices and adjusts their position to make Jungkook more comfortable, content to let him sleep there on the living room floor rather than moving to a bed.\n\nThe fifth chapter shifts focus to Jungkook's perspective and his after-work routine. He usually finds ways to occupy himself nearby until Taehyung is ready to head home together. On occasions when he does go back first, he often cooks dinner, spurred on by Taehyung's compliments (which he suspects are somewhat exaggerated to encourage him).\n\nA constant in their routine is how Taehyung helps Jungkook wind down for bed, especially given Jungkook's struggles with insomnia. Taehyung brews him special teas, having researched the best blends to aid sleep. Jungkook is touched by the care and effort Taehyung puts into this nightly ritual.\n\nThe domestic details and gentle consideration they show each other further underscore the depth of their bond and how intertwined their lives have become. The easy physical affection and attentiveness to each other's needs hint at the love underlying their friendship, even if it remains unspoken.",
    "Test (2024-05-24 11:46:46.051830): 6th page:\n\nHe talks about trivial things, voice serene and low, lulls Jungkook\u2019s brain into a false state of peacefulness. He\u2019s always liked Taehyung\u2019s voice, that ain\u2019t something new. Listening to it to sleep has its disadvantages\u2014that\u2019s how the dreams started\u2014, but are they really disadvantages? When the tea ends, Taehyung drags Jungkook to bed and keeps talking his ears off. Jungkook talks back, too, some times more than others, but his tongue drags heavier inside his mouth. His own voice is deeper than usual, letting his tiredness show. The tea sure has an effect, his eyelids can barely hold up, and he _likes_ to hear Taehyung talk. Taehyung can be silent for long times, and Jungkook likes that, too, but Taehyung\u2019s voice seems to make his heart overflow. Sadly, it\u2019s not always that Taehyung stays. For some reason Jungkook can\u2019t understand, he has to go to his own bed. He considers disposing of Taehyung\u2019s bed a few times, but then he would have to give up the times Taehyung invited him to his bed instead of joining in Jungkook\u2019s one, and he wasn\u2019t ready for that yet. It was nice and different when they watched a drama or anime in _Taehyung\u2019s_ bed. And Taehyung _invited_ him to stay. Jungkook liked sleeping in Taehyung\u2019s bed too, and for that to keep happening Taehyung had to have his own bed. Unfortunately. Watching anime before bed is a big no\u2014they both get way too excited, and end up sleeping way past one in the morning. That, sometimes, happens. But not much. Taehyung takes sleeping seriously, for his sake. Which is why most of the times he leaves Jungkook\u2019s bed when he thinks Jungkook is already asleep, Jungkook won\u2019t say anything. Most times, however, aren\u2019t tonight. On some rare occasions such as now, Jungkook reaches his left hand, towards Taehyung\u2019s wrist, and grabs it gently. \u201cYou\u2019re still awake?\u201d Taehyung whispers, surprised. They barely slept that Saturday, waking up to sunlight on their faces because the living room windows are big and the curtains translucent. The movie marathon the night before had Jungkook sleeping on the floor, he just didn\u2019t want it to end. \u201cBarely,\u201d he answers, not even opening his eyes. Taehyung waits in silence for a moment, then asks: \u201cYou want something?\u201d   _Stay,_ Jungkook thinks. _You don\u2019t have to go._  \u201cNah,\u201d he answers instead, suddenly way more nervous than he should be. What was he thinking? Why did he reach for Taehyung when Taehyung clearly wanted to leave? \u201c... Then?\u201d  Jungkook loosens the grip on Taehyung\u2019s wrist, pulling back. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing. Sorry.\u201d  Silence befalls the room, Taehyung isn\u2019t moving and Jungkook is definitely getting more anxious by the second. He opens his eyes at the same time Taehyung lays down again. \u201cI\u2019m staying. My job here isn\u2019t done yet.\u201d  Jungkook chuckles, closing his eyes again in a dumb attempt at hiding his embarrassment. \u201cThat\u2019s not your _job_.\u201d  \u201cHmph. Who said that?\u201d He can hear Taehyung moving closer, until his body is wrapping around Jungkook\u2019s waist, pressing his face against Taehyung\u2019s chest. \u201cThey\u2019re right, but only because I\u2019m doing this because I want to. Now, let\u2019s go to sleep, Koo. Good night.\u201d  Jungkook lets out a breath he didn\u2019t know he was holding. \u201cNight.\u201d  It\u2019s a little strangled, but Taehyung tightens the embrace and runs his fingers through Jungkook\u2019s hair, and soon enough he\u2019s not conscious enough to be nervous about anything at all. \t6",
    "Agent (2024-05-24 11:47:13.576477): In this tender scene, Taehyung's nightly ritual of helping Jungkook fall asleep is described in more detail. He brews a special tea and then talks to Jungkook in a soothing, low voice about trivial things, gradually lulling him into a peaceful state. Jungkook finds Taehyung's voice comforting and enjoys listening to him, even if it sometimes leads to certain dreams (which he doesn't seem to mind).\n\nOnce the tea is finished, Taehyung usually guides a sleepy Jungkook to bed and continues talking until he drifts off. Although Jungkook likes having Taehyung stay with him, Taehyung typically leaves for his own bed once he thinks Jungkook is asleep. Jungkook muses about getting rid of Taehyung's bed altogether but hesitates because he also cherishes the times Taehyung invites him to sleep in his bed instead.\n\nTonight, however, Jungkook reaches out and grasps Taehyung's wrist as he's about to leave, a rare occurrence. When Taehyung asks if he wants something, Jungkook thinks \"Stay\" but nervously brushes it off out loud, quickly releasing his hold.\n\nAfter a moment of silence, Taehyung surprises Jungkook by lying back down and declaring that his \"job\" isn't done yet. He wraps himself around Jungkook, holding him close and stroking his hair. Taehyung clarifies that he stays because he wants to, not out of obligation. As they settle in to sleep, Jungkook relaxes into the embrace, his nervousness fading.\n\nThis intimate moment highlights the unspoken longing and comfort they find in each other's presence. Jungkook's desire for Taehyung to stay with him, and Taehyung's willingness to do so, underscore the depth of their feelings, even if they haven't fully acknowledged them yet. The physical affection and gentle care they show each other create a sense of safety and belonging between them.",

Jungkook spaces out through most of it, dutifully pushing the shopping cart, even though he enjoys the food bits. And there are always food bits, no matter how many times they hit the market. \u201cDetergent _again_?\u201d Jungkook asks, startled to see it inside their cart. \u201cYes? Have you seen the number of dishes we make?\u201d  \u201cHave you seen the amount of _laundry_ we make? And we\u2019re not buying detergent for _that_ again.\u201d  Taehyung shakes his head, chuckling. \u201cOh, honey, that\u2019s not how this works.\u201d  Jungkook\u2019s face heats up instantly, and he focuses on hiding it instead of arguing. Taehyung must be right, he\u2019s the one who can\u2019t see a single spoon on the kitchen sink before he\u2019s doing the dishes again. A worker nearby drops one of the cans she\u2019s piling up on the bottom shelf, attracting both their eyes for a second. \u201cAnyway, last time we bought this was just a test, sometimes I\u2019m allergic to detergents. This one is good, though, and it\u2019s cheaper too, so we\u2019re buying more.\u201d  Jungkook shrugs. \u201cFair enough.\u201d  \u201cWhat else is on the list?\u201d  \u201cCereals. And eggs.\u201d  \u201cOh, this way then!\u201d  They stop when there\u2019s enough to fill four\u2014ecological\u2014bags, heading to the single counter and waiting for the cashier to come. It\u2019s a small market, a little farther from their apartment building than other markets, but Taehyung likes to support local businesses such as this one. And so does Jungkook, who also appreciates the extras they get whenever the owners are around, and the homemade treats they always have. \u201cLook, Tae, homemade melonpan!\u201d  Taehyung eyes it with curiosity. Their melonpan is his favorite. \u201cIs it fresh?\u201d  Before Jungkook can check the date, the same worker from before answers, assuming the cashier\u2019s place. \u201cYes! They were baked today.\u201d  \u201cCan we buy them? Can we, Tae?\u201d  Jungkook\u2019s eyes sparkle, as if Taehyung was ever going to deny him and he needed to resort to such a low trick. \u201cSure, you big baby.\u201d  The woman chuckles as Jungkook gets them _four_ packages, and Taehyung flicks his earlobe and messes with his hair, almost annoyed with his cuteness. \u201cHow long have you two been together, if you don\u2019t mind me asking?\u201d  Taehyung\u2019s smile fades into confusion as he stops looking at Jungkook and turns to the cashier. \u201cUh?\u201d It\u2019s Jungkook who asks, though, eyes big and curious. The cashier fumbles with the groceries, visibly flustered. \u201cUm, you two live together, right?\u201d  \u201cYeah, but\u2026\u201d  Taehyung interrupts him, throwing his arm around Jungkook\u2019s shoulders. \u201cAlmost two years, ain\u2019t it, Koo?\u201d  \u201cHuh? Tae, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s what-\u201d  Taehyung nods, turning back to her. \u201cAlmost two years now!\u201d  The woman nods, smiling shyly. \u201cYou\u2026 both seem really happy, that\u2019s all. Sorry if I stepped out of line...\u201d  \u201cNot at all! We don\u2019t really keep track of time because it\u2019s just so effortless. Time passes too fast. I am happy. Aren\u2019t you, Koo?\u201d  Jungkook nods, albeit visibly stunned. The cashier finishes helping them with their groceries, and as soon as they step out of the market, Jungkook says, very slowly:  \u201cI have no idea what just happened.\u201d  Taehyung laughs, nerves hidden by how loud he allows himself to be now that they\u2019re out in the open. \u201cMr. and Ms",

While Taehyung enjoys the process, Jungkook seems content to follow along and push the cart, only really perking up at the food samples.\n\nTheir playful banter about detergent purchases and the amount of dishes versus laundry they generate showcases their familiarity and ease with each other. When Taehyung jokingly calls Jungkook \"honey,\" it flusters him, hinting at underlying feelings.\n\nAs they finish up and head to the checkout, Jungkook's excitement over finding homemade melonpan (a type of sweet bun) is endearing. Taehyung indulges him, unable to resist Jungkook's sparkling eyes and cuteness.\n\nThe key moment occurs when the cashier innocently asks how long they've been together. While Jungkook is caught off guard, Taehyung quickly plays along, putting his arm around Jungkook and confirming they've lived together for almost two years. The cashier apologizes if she overstepped but comments on how happy they seem together. Taehyung readily agrees, stating that he is indeed happy and time feels effortless with Jungkook.\n\nOutside the store, a bewildered Jungkook admits he's not sure what just happened. Taehyung laughs, trying to hide his own nervousness at how easily he went along with the cashier's assumption that they were a couple.\n\nThis interaction brings their undefined relationship to the forefront, forcing them to confront how they may appear to others and the happiness they find in their domestic life together. Taehyung's willingness to play into the couple assumption and his genuine admission of being happy with Jungkook suggests his feelings run deeper than friendship. Jungkook's confusion and Taehyung's hidden nerves indicate they may not be ready to fully address the shift in their dynamic yet.",

This is why he\u2019s usually the first one to wake up, and not the other way around.

Breakfast is ready, you have five minutes to get ready and move your ass to the kitchen.\u201d  \u201cHarsh.\u201d  In truth, it\u2019s really hard to wake up and get ready fast when the perspective of running a marathon is the only thing on his horizon.

Anyway, Yoongi is the one trying to impress someone.\u201d  \u201c _What_?\u201d  Jungkook laughs, pretending to be too busy with his game to reply as Taehyung eats his cereal. Is everyone on their orchestra group of friends dating or _interested_ in dating someone? That\u2019s just absurd. Yeah, they\u2019re all pretty cute, yes, but dating? A relationship? It just sounds\u2026 No, Taehyung can\u2019t see that. _Wait._ But what about Jungkook? \u201cSo\u2026\u201d He starts, instantly earning a glare from Jungkook. In turn, he apparently dies in the game he was playing, so Taehyung gets more than two seconds of his attention. \u201cHave _you_ got your eyes on anyone?\u201d  Jungkook coughs like he\u2019s choked on something, perhaps air. \u201cWhat?\u201d  \u201cEveryone\u2019s dating or something, apparently.

Or both. The marathon isn\u2019t too far, but they need to catch a bus first. Still, they\u2019re pretty on time\u2014Hoseok compliments their punctuality and Taehyung raises an eyebrow at Jungkook, who simply ignores him. It\u2019s not as bad as it seemed to be now that they\u2019re here. It\u2019s a nice day, not cold but not hot either, and of Taehyung manages to take it easy, he\u2019s positive he can reach the finish line. He does the stretching carefully, with Jungkook\u2019s help. Jungkook is probably ending the marathon in first place, the way he\u2019s always exercising around the apartment and going out for night or morning runs at ass o\u2019clock. He even looks like a natural, like he\u2019s a part of this environment instead of one of the people brought by a friend. He goes around helping everyone he can, morning sunlight hitting the most prominent features of his face and catching Taehyung\u2019s eyes. Taehyung squints, but doesn\u2019t look away",

Taehyung is reluctant, not being a fan of running, and complains that Hoseok is only doing this to impress Namjoon. \n\nJungkook surprises Taehyung by revealing that Namjoon and Jimin are actually a couple, and that it's Yoongi who is trying to impress someone. This leads to Taehyung wondering if Jungkook himself is interested in anyone, catching Jungkook off guard.\n\nWhen asked directly, Jungkook firmly denies dating anyone or even having a crush, and seems flustered or annoyed by the questioning. He hurries Taehyung to finish his breakfast so they can leave, perhaps to avoid the topic.\n\nAt the marathon, Hoseok compliments their punctuality, and Taehyung notes that it's not as bad as he anticipated. As they stretch and prepare, Taehyung observes Jungkook, who seems in his element. He moves naturally, helping others and looking at ease in the environment. \n\nTaehyung finds himself staring at Jungkook, the morning light highlighting his features. Even when he squints against the brightness, Taehyung can't seem to look away, hinting at his growing attraction and awareness of Jungkook in a new light.\n\nThe interaction about dating and crushes, along with Jungkook's flustered reaction, suggests an underlying tension and uncertainty about their own relationship. Taehyung's inability to tear his gaze away from Jungkook further underscores the shift in his feelings, even if he's not fully ready to acknowledge it yet.",
    "Test (2024-05-24 11:48:01.410587): 9th page:\n\nJungkook is sitting at the sidewalk by his side, smiling from ear to ear like he\u2019s not anywhere close to imminent death. \u201cMy legs were burning, Jungkook. _Burning._ And I\u2019m not exaggerating.\u201d  His hair is dripping sweat, and it shouldn\u2019t be _cute_ , but it\u2019s Jungkook. \u201cBut you did it! Imagine if you had some practice.\u201d  Taehyung lets out a weak snarl, lacking any bite to it. \u201cI\u2019d rather just keep watching you doing your routines around the house, thanks.\u201d  If Jungkook blushes, it\u2019s well hidden by the exercising blush that\u2019s still there. \u201cC\u2019mon, Tae. It was way better running along with you than it is running by myself every day. I\u2019ll keep up with you, and we don\u2019t have to go every day. _Please._ \u201d  That\u2019s true. Jungkook had kept his pace throughout the whole marathon, and that was probably why Taehyung had actually crossed the finish line. It was just impossible to resist Jungkook\u2019s puppy eyes. It was a trap all along, and Taehyung should have known it. \u201cFine.\u201d  Jungkook\u2019s face lights up instantly, and Taehyung almost feels good with himself for being the cause for his euphoria. A blond drops by Jungkook\u2019s side at the crosswalk, offering Taehyung a cold water bottle. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t even that hard.\u201d  And, truly, he\u2019s barely breaking any sweat. In fact, Yoongi looks almost _exactly_ like he did right before the marathon. Jungkook only chuckles by his side, and something clicks inside Taehyung\u2019s head. \u201cBastard. You called a taxi, didn\u2019t you?\u201d  Yoongi feigns innocence and utter bafflement. \u201cI would _never_ think of something like that.\u201d \t8. Chapter 8  The one thing Jungkook always tried to avoid was a matter of principle. Borrowing clothes from Taehyung was completely out of line. Because he had feelings Taehyung wasn\u2019t aware of, and he could never wear even a t-shirt from Taehyung without feeling stupidly giddy about it. This self-imposed rule only made him really good at having a tight schedule for their laundries. However. The weather was something Jungkook couldn\u2019t control just yet, and walking around the apartment without a t-shirt? That is fine. Going out in the cold weather without a hoodie? Well, that\u2019s just not as fine. Luckily, Jungkook wouldn\u2019t have to leave the house before his hoodies were all dry and ready to go, because it was still Sunday. \u201cOkay, we have like\u2026 six clothing items, together.\u201d Taehyung states, scientifically. \u201cI\u2019ll just stay under the blankets the whole day.\u201d  Taehyung chuckles, leaning into him. It makes everything inside Jungkook lights up, but he does his best to remain still. \u201cDon\u2019t be dumb, you should wear this.\u201d   And maybe it\u2019s because the specific item of clothing is so unexpected that Jungkook\u2019s brain comes to a halt, but he can\u2019t deny it. He ends up promptly accepting the pastel yellow crop top (crop top???) with long sleeves and then it\u2019s too late to deny it. Taehyung is happily singsonging to his favorite song (at the moment) and waltzing away from the laundry room, and Jungkook tries the crop top on  _ just because. _ It has their laundry\u2019s smell, after all, it shouldn\u2019t be that dangerous. \u2026 Except for the fact that he can\u2019t stop imagining Taehyung wearing this exact piece of clothing. When? In which context? Why hadn\u2019t Jungkook heard  _ anything  _ about this? They literally _ lived together. _  He can t deny the clothing item is fairly comfortable, and wearing nothing isn\u2019t exactly appalling when it\u2019s almost snowing outside. Even when their heating system is working just fine",
    "Agent (2024-05-24 11:48:26.392759): In this continuation, Taehyung is recovering from the marathon, sitting on the sidewalk with Jungkook. Despite his exhaustion and burning legs, Jungkook's presence and enthusiasm make the experience more bearable. Jungkook even convinces Taehyung to start running together regularly, promising to keep pace with him. Taehyung agrees, unable to resist Jungkook's pleading puppy eyes.\n\nWhen their friend Yoongi joins them, looking suspiciously fresh for someone who just ran a marathon, Taehyung jokingly accuses him of taking a taxi instead. Yoongi playfully denies it, showcasing the friendly, teasing dynamic among the group.\n\nThe scene then shifts to Jungkook's perspective, revealing his self-imposed rule of never borrowing clothes from Taehyung. This stems from his secret feelings for Taehyung and the giddy emotions that wearing Taehyung's clothes would evoke. To avoid this, Jungkook is diligent about their laundry schedule.\n\nHowever, due to unexpected weather and a shortage of clean hoodies, Jungkook finds himself in a predicament. Taehyung casually offers him a pastel yellow crop top with long sleeves to wear instead. Caught off guard, Jungkook accepts it before he can think twice.\n\nAs Taehyung happily goes about his business, Jungkook tries on the crop top and is surprised by how comfortable it is. However, he can't stop imagining Taehyung wearing it and wonders about the context in which he did. The fact that he hadn't known about this article of clothing, despite living together, intrigues and flusters him.\n\nThis scene highlights the growing intimacy and comfort between the characters, with Taehyung easily offering his clothes to Jungkook. At the same time, it underscores Jungkook's hidden feelings and the way small gestures, like wearing Taehyung's top, affect him deeply. The crop top itself adds a playful, unexpected element to their dynamics, hinting at aspects of Taehyung that Jungkook is still discovering.",
    "Test (2024-05-24 11:48:26.396747): 10th page:\n\n\u201cI just remembered I haven\u2019t eaten anything today.\u201d  \u201cWe\u2019ve literally just had lunch, what are you talking about?\u201d Jungkook closes the door behind him, dragging Taehyung back to his bed. \u201cAre we watching something?\u201d  And suddenly Taehyung is back to his usual self, scrambling back to bed and picking Jungkook\u2019s laptop. \u201cThere\u2019s a new episode of-\u201d  That\u2019s how they go \u2018til seven p.m., Taehyung tickling the expanse of exposed skin under the blankets every single time Jungkook threatened to fall asleep. When their group chat with\u00a0their friends from work decides to come back to life talking about dinner (? ), Taehyung jumps out of bed and runs to the laundry again, rummaging through their laundry, more clothes dry than before, and for some reason, Jungkook gets to wear his own clothes again, but Taehyung needs a hoodie. And all Taehyung\u2019s hoodies are either wet or dirty. So. \u201cMines are finally dry,\u201d Jungkoook offers, in exchange for the crop top offer earlier. \u201cLook, it was an unexpected change of weather, we couldn\u2019t have known,\u201d Taehyung says, already wearing Jungkook\u2019s jacket, not sure about what he\u2019s even accepting, only worried about not catching a cold. \u201cYeah,\u201d Jungkook agrees, reluctantly. But there\u2019s not much he can do. His selfish feelings have absolutely nothing to do with this. \u2b52\u2b51\u2b52\u2b51\u2b52  Namjoon saw them getting in the restaurant and gasps when he sees what Taehyung is wearing because there, at Taehyung\u2019s back, is Jungkook\u2019s name. Printed on fabric. Everyone is shellshocked, and then Seokjin says, \u201cCongrats on the relationship update! !\u201d  Jungkook looked confused and even more so Taehyung, even from afar, but their friends were just happy. They come to their table and greet everyone, Jungkook getting redder by the second. \u201cFucking finally,\u201d Jimin says, making space for them right by his side. \u201cWe can order now.\u201d  \u201cIt was about time,\u201d Hoseok says, winking Jungkook\u2019s way. Taehyung looks from Hoseok to Jungkook, and the later avoids him. \u201cTo order food?\u201d  \u201cYeah, sure,\u201d Hoseok winks again, and Taehyung looks like he\u2019s about to lose it. They choose a meal course to share, neither of them super hungry but both wanting extra fries, and even though that\u2019s usual, every single person on their table sighs, calling them disgusting,  _ of fucking course they\u2019re gonna share. _ And that\u2019s when Taehyung loses it. He stands up, shouting \u201cRestroom!\u201d and dragging Jungkook along with him. \u201cWhy does everyone seem to think that we\u2019re dating now?\u201d  Jungkook hides further inside his hoodie. \u201cIt\u2019s the jacket. The one I lent you.\u201d  \u201cWhat about it? I mean, what if they know it\u2019s yours, what does it have to do with\u2026\u201d  \u201cHmm, it\u2019s my university\u2019s varsity jacket.\u201d  Taehyung looks right into his eyes, in complete silence. \u201cOh.\u201d  \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I just- you needed something, and it was dry, and-\u201d  \u201cYou let me borrow your varsity jacket! That\u2019s so cute. _ Cutie. _ It\u2019s an honor, I can\u2019t believe it. I need a mirror, might snap some pics since we\u2019re here, I\u2019m wearing your varsity fucking jacket oh my god-\u201d  Jungkook is caught between dying and punching Taehyung, so he obviously only groans instead. \u201cTaehyung\u2026\u201d  \u201cYeah, join the photo, come here!\u201d  He ceases resisting Taehyung\u2019s shenanigans and just enjoys the moment. He deserves it, Taehyung being ridiculous and posing a hundred different ways to show off Jungkook\u2019s jacket is something he should be enjoying to the fullest. Christ",
    "Agent (2024-05-24 11:48:51.378756): In this scene, Jungkook and Taehyung spend a cozy day in bed, watching shows on Jungkook's laptop and playfully teasing each other. When their friend group chat comes alive with dinner plans, they scramble to get ready, only to realize that all of Taehyung's hoodies are either wet or dirty. Jungkook lends him his own jacket in return for Taehyung's earlier crop top offer.\n\nAt the restaurant, their friends' reactions to seeing Taehyung in Jungkook's jacket are priceless. Namjoon gasps, noticing Jungkook's name printed on the back, and Seokjin congratulates them on their \"relationship update.\" The others express similar sentiments, with Jimin and Hoseok implying they've been waiting for this development.\n\nConfused and flustered, especially by their friends' comments about them sharing a meal, Taehyung drags Jungkook to the restroom to talk. Jungkook explains that the jacket is his university varsity jacket, which carries a significant meaning when lent to someone else.\n\nInstead of being embarrassed or upset, Taehyung is thrilled. He gushes about how cute it is that Jungkook let him borrow such a special item and insists on taking photos to commemorate the moment. Jungkook is torn between being mortified and endeared by Taehyung's enthusiasm.\n\nThis scene marks a turning point in their relationship, with their friends' assumptions and the varsity jacket symbolism forcing them to confront the changing nature of their bond. Taehyung's delight at wearing Jungkook's jacket and his playful response suggest he's not entirely opposed to the idea of being seen as a couple.\n\nJungkook's mixed emotions and inability to fully resist Taehyung's antics hint at his own growing acceptance of his feelings. The lighthearted, affectionate interaction between them, even in the face of their friends' teasing, showcases the strength and potential of their relationship, whether they're ready to label it or not.",
    "Test (2024-05-24 11:48:51.382735): 11th and last page:\n\nTaehyung obliviously poses with his back turned to the mirror, hand resting on Jungkook\u2019s left shoulder, their chests almost pressed together, and it takes everything inside him not to embrace Taehyung\u2019s waist on a hug and sink his face on Taehyung\u2019s neck, hiding how flustered he is, but also how content he feels. Something changes right there and then, and Jungkook mentally sighs. This is why there was a rule, and he should have never borrowed any piece of clothing from Taehyung. He was still wearing the yellow crop top under his hoodie, even though it wasn't to show off, it was there, and he knew it, and that was why he was wearing it, despite whatever Taehyung thought it was. Now, there was  _ no  _ turning back.",
    "Agent (2024-05-24 11:49:16.208981): In this final scene, Taehyung continues to pose with Jungkook's varsity jacket in the restroom mirror, oblivious to the effect it's having on Jungkook. As Taehyung leans close, hand on Jungkook's shoulder and their chests nearly touching, Jungkook struggles to control his emotions. He's tempted to wrap his arms around Taehyung's waist and bury his face in his neck, both to hide his flustered state and to express his contentment.\n\nThis moment marks a significant shift in Jungkook's perspective. He realizes that his self-imposed rule about not borrowing Taehyung's clothes was a form of self-preservation, an attempt to keep his feelings in check. By wearing Taehyung's crop top under his hoodie, even if it's hidden, Jungkook has crossed a line he can't come back from.\n\nThe intimate proximity and Taehyung's casual affection force Jungkook to confront the depth of his emotions. He mentally acknowledges that there's no turning back now, implying that he can no longer deny or suppress his love for Taehyung.\n\nThis final scene leaves the reader with a sense of anticipation, wondering how Jungkook will navigate his newfound acceptance of his feelings and whether Taehyung will come to realize the true nature of their bond. The open-ended conclusion suggests that their relationship is on the cusp of a significant change, with the potential for a romantic future if they can overcome their hesitations and openly express their love for each other.\n\nThroughout the excerpt, the author has skillfully explored the tension, tenderness, and unspoken emotions between Jungkook and Taehyung, creating a compelling narrative of friends on the verge of becoming something more. The domestic scenes, playful banter, and subtle gestures all contribute to the building of their relationship, making the reader invested in their journey and hopeful for a happy resolution to their story.",

Someone said Jungkook didn't like kisses, neither giving or receiving them, and Taehyung scoffed and said Jungkook also didn't happen to like hugs, and **still** , Taehyung could hug him whenever he felt like it. \"So kiss him, then.\" Jimin provoked. Taehyung did. On Jungkook's right cheek, for whole three seconds and a half. Yes, Jungkook did count. He couldn't breathe for the whole thing, but right after it he put his tongue out for his friends, walking away as Taehyung puffed his chest looking very proud of himself. Jungkook laughed when he was at a safe distance, thinking of Taehyung showing off like a peacock for being allowed to kiss Jungkook's cheek. He was so dumb. And _endearing._  That's why he could get away with everything, although back then Jungkook wasn't aware of that. Not fully. Jimin looked quite full of himself, later. He had no idea why.",

    "Test (2024-05-24 11:49:30.417591): Option 2:\n\n\t9. Chapter 9  Taehyung wakes up a little more sluggish than usual, cheeks flushed like he\u2019s feverish, but Jungkook pressures him into taking his temperature and the thermometer gives them nothing. That\u2019s not enough to put Jungkook at ease\u2014the weather change was really unexpected, and he knows too damn well just how susceptible to them Taehyung is. While Jungkook\u2019s been dealing with his allergies throughout his whole life, Taehyung rarely ever gets sick. He\u2019s got iron immunity, superhero worthy, but every time Taehyung does get sick, it\u2019s official hospital visiting hours. Even his colds look like a new damn virus just got brought into the world. Maybe Jungkook is a little too impressionable, maybe he\u2019s worrying too much. However, as long as there\u2019s a probability he could be even remotely right, he\u2019s not going to change. Luckily so, because this time turns out to be one of the few times he\u2019s actually right, and when Taehyung almost passes out while standing, Jungkook is right here to catch him.",

When Jungkook\u2019s birthday is right around the corner and they will be on the road doing concerts during it, Taehyung knows what is coming. And there\u2019s no escape. It\u2019s not that they dislike their families \u2013 completely not their case, at all, but the timing. Always the timing. \u201cI\u2019m going to die,\u201d Jungkook states, and Taehyung knows it\u2019s not drama because he feels it too. He feels it, but he needs to be the stronger one this time, and so he says \u201cIt\u2019s a day off, we\u2019ve been working day and night in preparation for this, right? We deserve a little rest, too. And just before we hit the road, just in time! It\u2019s perfect.\u201d  Jungkook\u2019s eyes beg for mercy, and they both know what Taehyung said is true, but they both also know that their families coming over for an early birthday celebration isn\u2019t what _rest_ is.",

He had no problems whatsoever with celebrating other people's birthdays, though. It's a good thing he was born on the last days of the year, that way his birthday always mixes up with New Year's Eve and he convinces everyone to do something else. Something nice, nothing like a birthday party, mind you. Jungkook used to keep tabs on special dates, for a good time, until he realized it was dumb and meaningless. Of course, if you were giving it meaning, then it meant something. But what he found out was that he, in fact, enjoyed a lot more spontaneous acts of affection. And, even knowing this, Taehyung bought him the pair of jacket and pants he had been eyeing for weeks.",

You\u2019re hurt.\u201d  Taehyung rolls his eyes, but he can\u2019t keep the endearment he feels for Jungkook from overflowing in a soft smile. \u201cFine. I\u2019ll put the clean dishes away, then.\u201d  \u201cJust leave them there, Tae...\u201d  \u201cNo, Jungkook, I am helping. You helped me cook, so it\u2019s only fair.\u201d  Jungkook exhales, looking fed up with him and his headstrongness. \u201cOnly the dry ones. None of the things I\u2019m going to wash now.\u201d  \u201cDeal,\u201d Taehyung agrees with a chuckle. This is all so\u2026 See, he does not want to think that, but _domestic._ It is, isn\u2019t it? They\u2019re not just two people sharing an apartment. Per se, they never were, because their friendship was great and they were each other\u2019s best friends. But this was, somehow, a whole new level. Makes him laugh that this seems more personal than sleeping together on the same bed. Makes him question how happy that seems to make him.",

He knows he\u2019s been acting cold and distant, and what\u2019s worse, he feels that Taehyung knows it too. Maybe it\u2019s all in his head, but guilt still eats away at him. Taehyung has nothing to do with his feelings, and he shouldn\u2019t be affected by whatever goes on with them. Jungkook is a bad friend, he\u2019s a bad person, and these thoughts are bad because this is a difficult loop to escape.",
