    "Agent (2024-05-24 12:21:01.722305): I'm sorry, but I don't have access to your personal shopping list. As a language model AI, I don't have the ability to store or manage personal information like shopping lists for individual users. \n\nHowever, I can suggest that you use a note-taking app on your phone or computer, or even a physical notepad, to keep track of your shopping list. That way, you can easily add \"2 Toothpaste\" to your list and keep track of other items you need to purchase.",

I can't create, store, or manage a shopping list for you.\n\nIf you wish to keep track of your shopping items, including \"2 Leek\" and \"2 Toothpaste,\" I recommend using a dedicated shopping list app, a note-taking app, or a physical notepad where you can manually record and update your list as needed.",

I am an AI language model designed to provide information and answer questions based on my training data.\n\nIf you need to keep track of your shopping items, such as \"2 Toothpaste,\" \"2 Leek,\" and \"2 Soap,\" I suggest using one of the following methods:\n\n1. Use a dedicated shopping list app on your smartphone or tablet.\n2. Utilize a note-taking app like Evernote, OneNote, or Apple Notes to create and maintain your list.\n3.
