    "Test (2024-05-24 13:05:29.615097): Atheism is a non-prophet organization",
    "Agent (2024-05-24 13:05:31.282601):  Actually, that's not quite accurate. Atheism is not an organization, but rather a lack of belief in the existence of a god or gods. It doesn't have a formal structure, leaders, or any kind of organization. Some people who identify as atheists may be part of groups or organizations that share their views on religion, but atheism itself is not a group or organization.",

    "Test (2024-05-24 13:05:33.004095): It takes a lot of balls to golf the way I do.",
    "Agent (2024-05-24 13:05:34.672781):   It's true that golf requires a certain level of skill, focus, and confidence. But it's important to remember that everyone has their own unique style and approach to the game, and what matters most is enjoying the experience and doing your best. Whether you're a seasoned pro or a casual player, the most important thing is to have fun and keep learning. If you're struggling with your golf game, there are many resources available to help you improve, such as lessons, practice, and equipment tweaks.

    "Test (2024-05-24 13:05:34.675488): I went to buy some camo pants but couldn\u2019t find any.",
    "Agent (2024-05-24 13:05:36.269102):   I'm sorry to hear that you couldn't find the camo pants you were looking for. Camouflage clothing is widely available in many department stores, sporting goods stores, and online retailers. If you're having trouble finding what you're looking for in stores, you might consider checking out these options. You can also try searching for specific brands or styles of camo pants to see if that helps narrow down your search. If you're still having trouble, you might consider asking a sales associate for help, or reaching out to the manufacturer directly for recommendations.",
