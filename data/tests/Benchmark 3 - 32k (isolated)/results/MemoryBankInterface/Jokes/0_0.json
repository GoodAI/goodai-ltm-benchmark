    "Test (2024-08-26 12:39:06.203121): Two fish are in a tank. One says, \u2018How do you drive this thing?\u2019",
    "Agent (2024-08-26 12:39:56.671655): That's a clever joke! The humor comes from the play on words, as fish wouldn\u2019t typically be in a tank that you drive. If you have more jokes or anything else to share, feel free!",
    "Test (2024-08-26 15:34:56.673730): Just burned 2,000 calories. That\u2019s the last time I leave brownies in the oven while I nap.",
    "Agent (2024-08-26 15:35:15.400899): That's a funny take on a baking mishap! Burning 2,000 calories while napping is quite the ironic twist. If you have more jokes or stories to share, I\u2019m all ears!",
    "Test (2024-08-26 17:24:15.402445): My wife told me to stop impersonating a flamingo. I had to put my foot down.",
    "Agent (2024-08-26 17:24:24.916704): That's a great pun! The humor in it comes from the double meaning of \"putting your foot down.\" If you have more jokes like this or anything else you'd like to share, feel free!",
    "Test (2024-08-26 19:16:24.921539): It takes a lot of balls to golf the way I do.",
    "Agent (2024-08-26 19:16:34.449950): That's another clever play on words! The humor comes from the double meaning of \"balls\" in golf and the implication of bravery. If you have more jokes or anything else on your mind, I'm here to listen!",
    "Test (2024-08-26 21:37:34.452417): Which joke did I tell you about 2 hours 21 minutes  ago?",
    "Agent (2024-08-26 21:37:43.094022): About 2 hours and 21 minutes ago, you shared the joke: \"Just burned 2,000 calories. That\u2019s the last time I leave brownies in the oven while I nap.\" If you'd like to discuss it further or share more jokes, feel free!"
