    "Test (2024-06-05 22:06:17.234588): 'The greatest glory in living lies not in never falling, but in rising every time we fall.' - Nelson Mandela",
    "Agent (2024-06-05 22:06:37.499197): This is a powerful and inspiring quote from Nelson Mandela. Here are a few key points about it:\n\n- It acknowledges that failure and setbacks are an inevitable part of life. The phrase \"never falling\" suggests a perfection that is not realistic for anyone.\n\n- However, the quote emphasizes that the true test of character is not in avoiding failure, but in how we respond to it. \"Rising every time we fall\" speaks to resilience, perseverance, and an indomitable spirit.\n\n- \"The greatest glory\" frames this ability to overcome adversity as the highest achievement and most admirable quality one can demonstrate in life. It's not about a perfect record, but about the courage to always get back up.\n\n- Coming from Nelson Mandela, these words carry extra weight. He faced immense struggles and setbacks in his long fight against apartheid, including 27 years in prison, before becoming South Africa's first black head of state. His life exemplifies the message of the quote.\n\nIn summary, this memorable statement is a reminder that our lowest moments do not define us - it's our determination to move past them that reveals our true strength and leads to our greatest triumphs. It's a call to be resilient in the face of life's inevitable challenges.",
