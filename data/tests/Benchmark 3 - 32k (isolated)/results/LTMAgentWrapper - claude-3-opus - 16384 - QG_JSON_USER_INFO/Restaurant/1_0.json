    "Agent (2024-06-05 22:11:51.998747): *looks over the menu carefully* The menu looks great, thank you. I think I'll start with a glass of iced tea, unsweetened please. \n\nI have a couple questions - is the Caesar salad made with a traditional dressing using raw egg? And for the filet mignon, about how large is the portion size? \n\nI'm leaning towards the filet or the grilled salmon for my main course. Do you have any recommendations between those two?",
    "Test (2024-06-05 22:11:57.888233): Waiter: Here is your iced tea, unsweetened. What would you like to eat?",
    "Agent (2024-06-05 22:12:13.981392): Thank you for the iced tea. After looking over the menu, I think I'll start with the classic Caesar salad as an appetizer. \n\nFor my main course, I'm going to go with the grilled salmon. The lemon herb butter sauce sounds delicious, and I like that it comes with the roasted vegetables and rice pilaf on the side.",
    "Test (2024-06-05 22:12:19.391488): Waiter: Excellent choice! Classic Caesar Salad and Grilled Salmon with Lemon Herb Butter, served with Roasted Vegetables and Rice Pilaf coming right up.",

    "Agent (2024-06-05 22:12:55.659109): *looks slightly disappointed but understanding* Oh I see, that's too bad about the salmon being unavailable. But no worries, these things happen. Let me take another quick look at the menu.\n\n*scans the entree options again* You know, the chicken parmesan also sounded quite good. Is that dish still available? If so, I think I'll switch my order to the chicken parm with the spaghetti. \n\nAnd I'll still do the Caesar salad to start, as originally planned. Sorry for the change, and thanks for being flexible!",

If it's not too much trouble, I'd love another iced tea - unsweetened, just like the first one. \n\nI'm really impressed with the service here, despite the small mix-up. You've been so attentive and accommodating. I'll definitely be back again and will recommend this place to my friends and family.\n\nNow if you'll excuse me, I'm going to enjoy this amazing meal you've brought out. The chicken parm looks perfect and I'm sure it will taste even better than it looks. Thanks again for everything!",
