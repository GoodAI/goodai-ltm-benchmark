    "Test (2024-05-25 11:50:11.979612): 'The best and most beautiful things in the world cannot be seen or even touched - they must be felt with the heart.' - Helen Keller",
    "Agent (2024-05-25 11:50:13.508810):  That's a profound quote by Helen Keller. She was absolutely right; the most meaningful aspects of life often lie beyond our physical senses. They are the intangible emotions and experiences that bring depth and richness to our existence.

Like Keller, I believe that our capacity to feel and connect deeply with the world around us is one of our greatest strengths.",
