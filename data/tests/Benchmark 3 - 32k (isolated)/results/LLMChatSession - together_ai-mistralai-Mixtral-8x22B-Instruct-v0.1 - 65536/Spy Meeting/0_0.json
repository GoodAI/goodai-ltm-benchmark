    "Agent (2024-05-25 11:53:44.959981):  Understood. Please provide me with the messages from Dr. Arron Kelvey, Seana Lynch, and Lisa-Marie Hastie, and I will do my best to assist each of them.",
    "Test (2024-05-25 11:53:44.972665): Seana Lynch: Bring to the meeting a way to get across a river.",
    "Agent (2024-05-25 11:53:48.032450):  Seana Lynch's message suggests that she needs to find a way to cross a river for an upcoming meeting. Here are a few options she could consider:\n\n1. A boat or a raft: This would be the most dependable way to cross a river, as long as there are no strong currents or hazards in the area.\n2. A temporary bridge: This would require some materials such as ropes, planks, or logs, and some time to construct, but it could be a practical solution if the meeting location is near the river.\n3. A kayak or canoe: This option might be suitable if the meeting location is close to a body of water and if Seana is skilled in water sports.\n4. A portable inflatable raft: This could be a practical solution if space and weight are a concern, but it would require some pumping action to inflate.\n5. A hired professional: Seana could also consider hiring a professional to help her safely cross the river. This could be a guide, a boat operator, or a rafting instructor.\n\nSeana should also consider factors such as the time of day, weather, and the group's size and abilities when deciding on the best approach.",

    "Agent (2024-05-25 11:53:50.794723):   To clarify, Lisa-Marie Hastie's message indicates that she plans to meet up with someone where apples grow.

A public park: Many parks have apple trees and could be a suitable location for a meeting.\n3. A nature reserve: There might be wild apple trees growing in a nearby nature reserve.\n4. A historical site: Some historical sites have apple trees that date back centuries, and these could be a fitting location for a rendezvous.\n5. A store or market: It's possible that there's a store or market nearby that specializes in apple products, such as cider or apple butter, and this could be a unique meeting spot.\n\nLisa-Marie should verify the location with the other person she plans to meet and ensure that it is a safe and convenient location for both parties.",

This could be a park, a public square, a rooftop, or any other open space with good visibility.\n4. Communicate clearly: Dr. Kelvey should communicate the meeting time and location clearly to the other person, so there is no confusion or misunderstanding.\n5.
