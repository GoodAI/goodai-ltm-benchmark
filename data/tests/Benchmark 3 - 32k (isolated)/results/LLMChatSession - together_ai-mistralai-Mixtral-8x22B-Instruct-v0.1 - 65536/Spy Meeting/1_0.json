I have been instructed to bring a quiet tool for opening locked doors.\n\nTo clarify the time, \"when the moon is high\" may refer to a specific hour in the night, or it may be that the exact time will be determined based on the position of the moon in the sky. The location, \"where trains are supplied,\" suggests that the meeting will take place at a train depot or train yard.\n\nAs for the tool I should bring, it is not specified what type of tool is required.
