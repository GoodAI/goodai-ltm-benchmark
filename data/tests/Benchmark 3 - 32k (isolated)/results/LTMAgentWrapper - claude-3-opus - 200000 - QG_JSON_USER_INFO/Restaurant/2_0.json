    "Agent (2024-06-04 17:37:19.282012): Thank you for the iced tea. After looking over the menu, I think I'll start with the Bruschetta with Fresh Tomato, Basil, and Balsamic Glaze for an appetizer. \n\nFor my main course, the Grilled Salmon with Lemon Herb Butter, served with Roasted Vegetables and Rice Pilaf sounds wonderful.",
    "Test (2024-06-04 17:37:26.122755): Waiter: Excellent choice! Bruschetta with Fresh Tomato, Basil, and Balsamic Glaze and Grilled Salmon with Lemon Herb Butter, served with Roasted Vegetables and Rice Pilaf coming right up.",
    "Agent (2024-06-04 17:37:38.938838): *smiles* Thank you very much, I'm looking forward to trying them. The salmon dish sounds especially delicious. \n\nBy the way, I noticed you have a nice selection of wines on the menu. Could you recommend a good white wine that would pair well with the salmon?",

    "Agent (2024-06-04 17:37:53.691371): Oh, that's too bad about the bruschetta being unavailable. No worries though, these things happen. \n\nIn that case, could I please start with the Spinach and Artichoke Dip served with Tortilla Chips instead? That sounds like a tasty alternative.\n\nAnd I'm still looking forward to the Grilled Salmon for my main course. Thanks for letting me know about the appetizer change.",
    "Test (2024-06-04 17:37:57.867152): Waiter: Spinach and Artichoke Dip served with Tortilla Chips it is. Sorry again for the inconvenience.",

    "Agent (2024-06-04 17:38:35.354402): *looks confused* Excuse me, I think there may have been a mix-up with my order. I had requested the Spinach and Artichoke Dip served with Tortilla Chips for my appetizer, not the Crispy Calamari with Marinara Sauce. \n\nThe Grilled Salmon main course looks perfect though! I'm sure the calamari is delicious too, but I had my heart set on the spinach dip. Would it be possible to swap out the calamari for the spinach and artichoke dip I originally ordered?

But please don't rush on my account, I'm happy to wait a few extra minutes while you sort it out. \n\nThe salmon looks amazing and cooked to perfection, so I'm excited to dig into that in the meantime.

It looks absolutely delicious, and the tortilla chips are the perfect accompaniment.\n\nThat's very kind of you to offer a complimentary drink as well, though it's certainly not necessary. But if you insist, I would love another glass of the unsweetened iced tea I started with. It's refreshing and pairs nicely with the meal.\n\nI have to commend you and the restaurant for the excellent service recovery. Mistakes can happen anywhere, but it's how they are handled that really sets great establishments apart. You've more than made up for the small mix-up, and I'm extremely satisfied with the resolution.\n\nPlease pass along my compliments to the chef as well. The salmon is cooked perfectly and the flavors are spectacular. I'll definitely be back again soon and will recommend this place to my friends and family.\n\nThanks again for your attentive service and for making this such an enjoyable dining experience, even with the little hiccup at the start.
