    "Test (2024-06-04 17:29:04.491848): 'The greatest glory in living lies not in never falling, but in rising every time we fall.' - Nelson Mandela",
    "Agent (2024-06-04 17:29:29.984177): This is a powerful and inspiring quote from Nelson Mandela. Here are a few key points about it:\n\n- Mandela is acknowledging that failure and setbacks are an inevitable part of life. No one can go through life without \"falling\" at times.\n\n- However, he believes that true greatness and glory doesn't come from a perfect record of never failing. Rather, it comes from the resilience to pick yourself back up and keep going when you do encounter failure.\n\n- There is something noble and admirable about having the strength of character to rise again after falling. It takes courage, perseverance and an indomitable spirit.\n\n- This ability to overcome obstacles and bounce back from adversity is, in Mandela's view, the most laudable and glorious trait one can possess.\n\n- His words encourage us not to fear failure or be crushed by it, but to expect it as part of any meaningful journey and to focus our energies on rising again.\n\nThe quote encapsulates Mandela's own remarkable story, as someone who faced immense hardships and setbacks in his long fight against apartheid, but continually rose up to become a global icon of moral leadership. But it's a message that resonates for anyone striving to live with purpose and make a difference.",
