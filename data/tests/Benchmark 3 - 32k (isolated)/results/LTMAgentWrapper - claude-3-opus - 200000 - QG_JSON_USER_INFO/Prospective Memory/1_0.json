    "Test (2024-06-04 17:27:47.169702): 'The best and most beautiful things in the world cannot be seen or even touched - they must be felt with the heart.' - Helen Keller",
    "Agent (2024-06-04 17:28:12.362862): This is a beautiful and profound quote from Helen Keller. Here are my thoughts on it:\n\nHelen Keller is highlighting that the most meaningful and impactful things in life are not material or tangible, but rather emotional, spiritual and felt deeply within ourselves. Superficial beauty that we can see with our eyes is fleeting, but true beauty touches the soul.\n\nShe's referring to profound human experiences and virtues like love, kindness, compassion, joy, and inner peace. These are the things that give life its greatest meaning and richness. You can't reach out and touch love, but feeling love in your heart from family and friends is one of the most powerful forces there is.\n\nThe quote also speaks to appreciating the immaterial essence of things, not just their external appearance. A breathtaking sunset is beautiful to look at, but even more moving is the awe, wonder and emotional connection we feel when experiencing it. \n\nAdditionally, Keller, who was blind and deaf from a young age, is reminding us that perceiving the world isn't limited to sight and the other senses. The heart and spirit have a perception all their own, one that runs deeper than the physical.\n\nUltimately, this quote is an invitation to connect with what matters most - the love, beauty, meaning and sacred experiences we carry in our hearts. That is where we discover life's greatest joys and most profound truths. The external is temporary, but what we feel inside endures.",
