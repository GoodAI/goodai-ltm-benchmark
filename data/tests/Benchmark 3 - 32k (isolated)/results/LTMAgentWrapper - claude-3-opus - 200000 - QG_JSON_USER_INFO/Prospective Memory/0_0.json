    "Test (2024-06-04 17:26:18.651488): 'Do not go where the path may lead, go instead where there is no path and leave a trail.' - Ralph Waldo Emerson",
    "Agent (2024-06-04 17:26:42.557719): This is a famous quote by Ralph Waldo Emerson, an American essayist, lecturer, philosopher, abolitionist and poet who lived from 1803 to 1882. He was a key figure in the transcendentalist movement.\n\nThe quote encourages individuality, self-reliance and trailblazing. Some key interpretations:\n\n- Don't just follow the conventional, well-trodden path in life. Have the courage to go your own way.\n\n- Be an independent thinker. Don't just conform to societal norms and expectations. \n\n- Forge your own unique path based on your own ideas, beliefs and convictions, even if it's unpopular or uncharted.\n\n- By going your own way, you can leave a \"trail\" for others to potentially follow. You can be a pioneer and inspire others.\n\n- There is value in originality, creativity and going against the grain. Don't be afraid to stand out.\n\nEmerson was a strong proponent of individualism and believed that one should trust their own intuition and discernment over blindly adhering to the dictates of society, religion or tradition. This quote embodies that philosophy of charting your own course in life. It encourages having an adventurous spirit and believing in your own capability to navigate the unknown.",
