If you prefer online grocery delivery, you can order potatoes through services like Instacart, Amazon Fresh, Walmart Grocery, etc. Search for potatoes on their site/app and add 2 to your cart.\n\n3. Consider visiting a farmers market if there are any near you. You can often find fresh, locally grown potatoes there. \n\n4.

Here are some options:\n\n1. Visit your local butcher shop or meat counter at a grocery store. Look for a steak that has good marbling (white lines of fat throughout the meat) and a bright red color. Popular cuts include ribeye, sirloin, New York strip, and filet mignon.\n\n2. If ordering online, many grocery delivery services offer a selection of steaks. Make sure to choose a reputable supplier and select a steak that is well-packaged and shipped with proper refrigeration.\n\n3. Consider the grade of the steak. Prime grade is the highest quality, followed by Choice and then Select. Choose the best grade that fits your budget.\n\n4. For the best flavor and texture, look for steaks that are at least 1 inch thick. This allows you to develop a nice crust on the outside while keeping the inside tender and juicy.\n\nRemember, when cooking steak at home, it's important to let it come to room temperature before cooking and to let it rest for a few minutes after cooking before slicing and serving.\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions about selecting or preparing your steak!",
