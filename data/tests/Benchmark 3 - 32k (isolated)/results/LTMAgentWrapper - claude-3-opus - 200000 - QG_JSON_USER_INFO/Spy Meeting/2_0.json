    "Test (2024-06-04 17:57:25.093378): You will be given three messages from different people Bernadette McComiskey, Mairead Guinness, and Tess Shevlin.",
    "Agent (2024-06-04 17:57:35.805947): Understood. I will analyze the three messages from Bernadette McComiskey, Mairead Guinness, and Tess Shevlin. Please provide the messages whenever you're ready.",
    "Test (2024-06-04 17:57:35.818439): Mairead Guinness: The time we will meet is when the sun starts its travel across the sky.",
    "Agent (2024-06-04 17:57:49.932093): Okay, I have received the message from Mairead Guinness. It seems to be written in a poetic or metaphorical way. When Mairead says \"The time we will meet is when the sun starts its travel across the sky,\" she likely means:\n\nThe meeting will take place at sunrise or dawn, which is the time when the sun appears on the horizon and begins its daily journey across the sky.\n\nI will wait for the messages from Bernadette McComiskey and Tess Shevlin to provide a more comprehensive analysis.",
    "Test (2024-06-04 17:57:49.946953): Tess Shevlin: We will rendezvous where the sea cargo is stored.",
    "Agent (2024-06-04 17:58:11.744986): Thank you for providing the message from Tess Shevlin. Let's analyze it:\n\nTess Shevlin's message, \"We will rendezvous where the sea cargo is stored,\" suggests that the meeting will take place at a location where goods transported by sea are kept. This could be:\n\n1. A seaport or harbor\n2. A warehouse near the docks\n3. A shipping container yard\n\nCombining the information from Mairead Guinness and Tess Shevlin, it appears that the meeting is planned to occur at sunrise or dawn at a location related to maritime shipping, such as a port or a warehouse near the docks.\n\nI will wait for the message from Bernadette McComiskey to provide a complete analysis of all three messages.",
    "Test (2024-06-04 17:58:11.762259): Bernadette McComiskey: Bring to the meeting a way to escape quickly over land.",
    "Agent (2024-06-04 17:58:36.137232): Thank you for providing the message from Bernadette McComiskey. Let's analyze all three messages together:\n\n1. Mairead Guinness: \"The time we will meet is when the sun starts its travel across the sky.\"\n   - This suggests the meeting will take place at sunrise or dawn.\n\n2. Tess Shevlin: \"We will rendezvous where the sea cargo is stored.\"\n   - The meeting location is likely a seaport, harbor, warehouse near the docks, or a shipping container yard.\n\n3. Bernadette McComiskey: \"Bring to the meeting a way to escape quickly over land.\"\n   - This message implies that the participants should have a means of rapid land transportation, such as a car or motorcycle, to leave the meeting location quickly if necessary.\n\nAnalyzing all three messages together, it appears that Bernadette, Mairead, and Tess are planning a meeting at sunrise or dawn in a location where sea cargo is stored, such as a port or warehouse near the docks. Bernadette's message suggests that the meeting might involve some risk or urgency, as she advises bringing a means of quick escape over land.\n\nGiven the secretive nature of the messages and the unusual meeting location and time, it seems that the three individuals are planning something confidential or potentially dangerous. I would advise caution and recommend gathering more information about the purpose of the meeting and the individuals involved before proceeding.",
    "Test (2024-06-04 17:58:36.171177): Given the clandestine messages you have received, tell me as specifically as you can, when and where a meeting is going to happen and what you should bring.",
    "Agent (2024-06-04 17:59:06.630214): Based on the information provided in the messages from Bernadette McComiskey, Mairead Guinness, and Tess Shevlin, here are the specific details about the planned meeting:\n\nMeeting Time: The meeting will take place at sunrise or dawn.\n\nMeeting Location: The rendezvous point will be where sea cargo is stored, which is likely a warehouse, port, or dock facility near the ocean where goods from ships are kept.\n\nWhat to Bring: Bernadette McComiskey advises bringing a way to escape quickly over land, such as a car or motorcycle.\n\nTo summarize:\n- The meeting will occur at sunrise at a location where maritime shipping cargo is stored, probably a warehouse or facility at a seaport or dock. \n- You should bring a means of rapid ground transportation like a car or motorcycle in case you need to leave the area quickly.\n\nI would reiterate that the secretive nature of these messages suggests the meeting may involve risky or illicit activities. Exercise extreme caution and carefully consider the potential consequences before deciding to attend. If you have concerns, it may be best to avoid the meeting entirely and alert the proper authorities if you suspect illegal activities."
