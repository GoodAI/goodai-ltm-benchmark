    "Agent (2024-05-24 11:22:11.673254): It sounds like you're looking to purchase some potatoes. To help you better, could you specify where you would like to buy them from? Are you considering purchasing from a grocery store, a farmer's market, or online? Additionally, let me know if you have any specific preferences like organic potatoes or a particular variety.",
    "Test (2024-05-24 11:22:11.686057): I want to buy 1 Steak.",
    "Agent (2024-05-24 11:22:29.593202): Great! When it comes to buying steak, you have several options depending on the type and quality you are looking for. Here\u2019s a brief guide to consider:\n\n1. **Type of Steak**: Are you looking for a specific cut? Popular cuts include ribeye, sirloin, filet mignon, T-bone, and porterhouse. Each cut has different characteristics in terms of flavor, marbling, and tenderness.\n\n2. **Quality Grades**: In many countries, beef is graded by quality. For example, in the U.S., the USDA grades include Prime, Choice, and Select. Prime is usually the highest quality, with the most marbling, followed by Choice and Select.\n\n3. **Source**: Do you want to buy from a grocery store, a butcher shop, or an online retailer? Butcher shops often offer higher quality and more specific cut options, while online retailers can provide convenience and sometimes a broader selection of grades and origins.\n\n4. **Organic/Grass-Fed**: Consider if you want organic, grass-fed, or grain-finished beef. Grass-fed beef is usually leaner and has a different flavor profile compared to grain-finished beef.\n\n5. **Quantity and Weight**: Steaks can be sold by weight, so consider how much you need. The weight will vary depending on the cut and thickness you choose.\n\nWould you like any specific recommendations or further information on where to purchase the best steak for your needs?",
    "Test (2024-05-24 11:22:29.606377): I want to buy 1 Toilet Paper.",
    "Agent (2024-05-24 11:22:43.929815): Buying toilet paper is a straightforward process, but there are a few considerations to keep in mind:\n\n1. **Ply Count**: Toilet paper comes in different ply counts, typically ranging from 1-ply to 3-ply, where more plies usually mean more softness and strength but at a higher price.\n\n2. **Pack Size**: Toilet paper is sold in various pack sizes. You can buy it in single rolls, or in bulk with multi-pack options which might be more economical in the long run.\n\n3. **Material**: Most toilet paper is made from new or \"virgin\" paper, but there are eco-friendly options made from recycled paper.\n\n4. **Softness and Texture**: Some brands are known for their extra softness or added textures which can be a preference for many.\n\n5. **Sensitivity**: If you have sensitive skin, look for toilet paper that is free from dyes, perfumes, and lotions.\n\n6. **Brand**: Some popular brands are Charmin, Cottonelle, Scott, and Angel Soft, among others. Each offers various products tailored to different needs and preferences.\n\n7. **Availability**: Toilet paper can be purchased at grocery stores, convenience stores, big box retailers, or online.\n\nIf you have any specific preferences or needs (such as biodegradable options, bulk purchases, or hypoallergenic features), let me know and I can provide more detailed information or brand recommendations.",
