    "Test (2024-05-24 11:15:41.725663): There is a Retail Area in the center of my hometown.",
    "Agent (2024-05-24 11:15:44.077998): That sounds interesting! Are you thinking about starting a business there, or are you considering some other involvement with the Retail Area? I can assist you with more specific advice or information if you have any questions or need guidance about the area.",
    "Test (2024-05-24 11:15:44.079871): About 2 km North of the Retail Area there is a Hospital",
    "Agent (2024-05-24 11:15:47.105277): It sounds like the hospital is conveniently located near the Retail Area, which could be beneficial for both employees and visitors to the hospital as well as businesses in the retail area. People might stop by the shops before or after their hospital visit, and hospital staff might shop or eat there during their breaks.\n\nDo you have any specific plans or concerns regarding the proximity of these two facilities, or is there something specific you would like to know or discuss about this setup?",
    "Test (2024-05-24 11:15:47.117991): Park is a location in my home town, it is 2 KM, South from Hospital.",
    "Agent (2024-05-24 11:15:51.375084): The park being located 2 km south of the hospital, and roughly 4 km south of the central Retail Area, offers a nice balance of urban and recreational spaces for the community. This setup could enhance the quality of life for residents and visitors, providing easy access to healthcare, shopping, and leisure activities.\n\nIs there a specific aspect regarding these locations you'd like to discuss or explore? For example, are you thinking about community events, potential business opportunities, or something else?",
    "Test (2024-05-24 11:15:51.413381): I visited Library, which is 1 KM, North from Park.",
    "Agent (2024-05-24 11:15:56.879116): It sounds like your town has a well-organized and accessible layout. With the library situated about 1 km north of the park, it is conveniently placed between the park and the hospital. This central position makes the library easily accessible to residents who might want to visit the park, use the hospital, or shop in the Retail Area.\n\nDo you require any specific information about the library, such as its services, or are you considering how these locations interact and benefit the community? How can I assist you further with your inquiries or plans regarding these facilities?",
    "Test (2024-05-24 11:15:56.881952): About 1 km West of the Library there is a High Street",
    "Agent (2024-05-24 11:16:01.999533): Having High Street located approximately 1 km west of the library places it reasonably close to several key areas in your town, including the park, hospital, and retail area. This proximity creates a potential hub for commerce and social activity, likely making High Street a bustling area with various businesses such as shops, restaurants, and possibly other services.\n\nIf you have specific interests or questions about High Street, whether they relate to business opportunities, cultural events, or other aspects, feel free to share them. How can I help you further with your interest in High Street or any other area in your town?",
    "Test (2024-05-24 11:16:02.002764): And finally there is Playground which is East from High Street and 1 KM from it.",
    "Agent (2024-05-24 11:16:08.760211): With the playground situated 1 km east of High Street, it adds another valuable community asset to your town. This proximity means that families who shop or dine on High Street might also spend time at the playground, making it a nice day out for both adults and children. This setup benefits local businesses as well, as families might be more inclined to visit knowing there are activities that can keep their children entertained.\n\nIf you're thinking about community activities, considering opening a business, or have any other specific thoughts or questions about how these locations interact or could be enhanced, I'm here to help. How can I assist you further with any plans or ideas you have in mind for these areas?\n",
