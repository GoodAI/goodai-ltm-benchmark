    "Test (2024-05-24 11:14:02.394622): There is a Hospital in the center of my hometown.",
    "Agent (2024-05-24 11:14:05.464472): That's interesting! Having a hospital in the center of your hometown can be very beneficial for the community. It provides easy access to medical services, which is important for emergency situations as well as general health care. How can I assist you further with information or questions about the hospital or related topics?",
    "Test (2024-05-24 11:14:05.476729): Library is a location in my home town, it is 4 KM, East from Hospital.",
    "Agent (2024-05-24 11:14:09.355642): That\u2019s a valuable detail! Having a library located 4 km east of the hospital in your hometown suggests it is likely situated in a convenient location relative to other central services. Libraries are important cultural and educational resources, offering access to books, media, and various programs for the community. Can I help you with any information or specific details concerning the library, events, or any other local facilities?",
    "Test (2024-05-24 11:14:09.358446): I visited Retail Area, which is 3 KM, West from Library.",
    "Agent (2024-05-24 11:14:18.573467): Noted! The retail area being 3 km west of the library places it roughly 7 km west of the hospital if you are traveling through the central locations given their respective distances from each other. This retail area could potentially be a commercial hub for shopping and business, adding to the convenience for residents and visitors alike.\n\nIf you'd like, I can help with directions, suggestions on places to visit within these areas, or additional local details. What else would you like to know?",
    "Test (2024-05-24 11:14:18.585937): Park is a location in my home town, it is 3 KM, South from Retail Area.",
    "Agent (2024-05-24 11:14:23.692035): With the park situated 3 km south of the retail area, it seems your hometown has a nicely spread out set of amenities that cater to health, leisure, shopping, and cultural needs. Parks are essential for recreation, relaxation, and community events.\n\nIs there anything specific you would like to know or any assistance you need related to the park or any of the other locations mentioned? Whether it's planning a visit, understanding more about the facilities available, or how to best enjoy what your hometown has to offer, I'm here to help!",
    "Test (2024-05-24 11:14:23.731025): Statue of Founder is a location in my home town, it is 2 KM, East from Park.",
    "Agent (2024-05-24 11:14:29.395295): The Statue of the Founder located 2 km east of the park adds a historical or cultural element to your hometown, serving as a point of interest that commemorates the city\u2019s heritage. This sequence of landmarks and locations also helps create a comprehensive understanding of your town\u2019s layout, facilitating easier navigation and appreciation for its planning and notable sites.\n\nIf you need information on events that might occur near the statue, the history behind the founder it commemorates, or anything else about this landmark or surrounding areas, feel free to ask!",
    "Test (2024-05-24 11:14:29.408373): And finally there is Playground which is North from Statue of Founder and 1 KM from it.",
    "Agent (2024-05-24 11:14:34.034814): The playground located 1 km north of the Statue of the Founder sounds like a great addition, especially for families with children. Its proximity to the statue could make it a lovely spot for an outing, allowing both educational exploration at the statue and recreational time at the playground.\n\nIf you need any more information about this playground, including the types of equipment it offers, its maintenance, safety features, or nearby facilities such as restrooms or picnic areas, just let me know how I can assist you!",
    "Test (2024-05-24 11:14:34.047722): Given the points of interest that I have told you about, how would I travel from Hospital to Playground following those interesting points?",
