    "Test (2024-05-24 11:13:18.975600): Two fish are in a tank. One says, \u2018How do you drive this thing?\u2019",
    "Agent (2024-05-24 11:13:21.430942): That's a classic joke! It plays on the double meaning of the word \"tank\" \u2014 one being a container filled with water for keeping fish, and the other being a large military vehicle. The humor comes from the idea of fish trying to operate a combat vehicle. It's a fun play on words!",
    "Test (2024-05-24 11:13:21.434042): Light travels faster than sound, which is the reason that some people appear bright before you hear them speak.",
    "Agent (2024-05-24 11:13:23.990612): What a witty joke! This plays cleverly on the concepts of light and sound speeds to make a humorous observation about people's intellects and how they first come across. It highlights that first impressions can be deceiving until you get to know someone better. Thanks for sharing!",
    "Test (2024-05-24 11:13:24.003693): It takes a lot of balls to golf the way I do.",
    "Agent (2024-05-24 11:13:27.575050): That\u2019s a good one! This joke cleverly uses the double meaning of \"balls\" as both golf equipment and courage, delivering humor by implying that due to poor golfing skills, a lot of golf balls are lost during the game. A fun way to poke fun at one's own golfing abilities!",
    "Test (2024-05-24 11:13:27.588368): I failed math so many times at school, I can\u2019t even count.",
    "Agent (2024-05-24 11:13:30.545077): That's a clever play on words! The joke humorously highlights the idea of failing math by implying that the speaker's skills are so lacking they can't even perform a simple count. It's a fun way to poke fun at oneself while making others laugh. Thanks for sharing another great joke!",
