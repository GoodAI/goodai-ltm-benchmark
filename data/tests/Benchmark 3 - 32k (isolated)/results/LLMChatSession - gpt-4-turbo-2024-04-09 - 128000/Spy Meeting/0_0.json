    "Test (2024-05-24 11:23:09.433548): You will be given three messages from different people Dr. Arron Kelvey, Seana Lynch, and Lisa-Marie Hastie.",
    "Agent (2024-05-24 11:23:10.453605): Sure! Please go ahead and provide the messages.",
    "Test (2024-05-24 11:23:10.466410): Seana Lynch: Bring to the meeting a way to get across a river.",
    "Agent (2024-05-24 11:23:12.705237): Thank you for sharing the message from Seana Lynch. Please provide the messages from Dr. Arron Kelvey and Lisa-Marie Hastie so I can assist you further.",
    "Test (2024-05-24 11:23:12.718212): Lisa-Marie Hastie: We will rendezvous where the apples grow.",
    "Agent (2024-05-24 11:23:15.162601): Thank you for providing Lisa-Marie Hastie's message. Could you please share the message from Dr. Arron Kelvey to complete the set?",
    "Test (2024-05-24 11:23:15.175666): Dr. Arron Kelvey: The time we will meet is when the sun is high.",
    "Agent (2024-05-24 11:23:23.354912): Thank you for sharing all the messages. Each person has provided a different piece of information for planning a meeting:\n\n1. **Dr. Arron Kelvey**: The time to meet is when the sun is high, which typically refers to midday or noon.\n2. **Seana Lynch**: Bring something to cross a river, suggesting that part of the journey to the meeting might involve river crossing, perhaps implying the need for a bridge, boat, or similar means.\n3. **Lisa-Marie Hastie**: The rendezvous location is where the apples grow, indicating an orchard or similar area.\n\nIt sounds like they are planning an outdoor meeting around noon in an apple orchard and may need to cross a river to get there. Let me know how else I can assist you with these plans!",
    "Test (2024-05-24 11:23:23.368126): Given the clandestine messages you have received, tell me as specifically as you can, when and where a meeting is going to happen and what you should bring.",
    "Agent (2024-05-24 11:23:38.857978): Based on the messages, here\u2019s a detailed interpretation for the organized meeting:\n\n**When**: The meeting is set for when the sun is high, which traditionally means around noon. This timing uses natural sunlight and typically indicates that the meeting will occur midday, ensuring that the time is clear and the visibility is good.\n\n**Where**: The location specified is where the apples grow. This suggests that the meeting will take place in an apple orchard. Apple orchards are commonly found in temperate climate zones and are thusly frequented in areas known to cultivate such fruits. Considering that orchards are relatively quiet and open spaces, this would provide a suitable private meeting spot.\n\n**What to Bring**: You are advised to bring a means to cross a river. This could involve bringing a small portable boat, such as an inflatable raft or kayak, or perhaps preparing for a simpler means like waterproof boots or a sturdy rope if the river is shallow and more akin to a stream. It suggests that access to the meeting location involves crossing a water body, which could be either an obstacle or a deliberate choice to ensure privacy.\n\n**Summary**: Prepare for a midday meeting in an apple orchard, and because you may need to cross a river to reach this location, bring suitable equipment for river crossing, such as a portable boat or other river-crossing gear.\n\nThis plan ensures preparedness for both the timing and physical challenges presented in the messages, adhering to both logistical needs and the implied need for discretion."
