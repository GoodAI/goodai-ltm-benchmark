    "Test (2024-05-24 11:31:14.134857): There is a Park in the center of my hometown.",
    "Agent (2024-05-24 11:31:15.587501): That's wonderful! Having a park in the center of town can offer a great space for relaxation, recreation, and community events. Do you enjoy spending time there? What activities or features does the park have?",
    "Test (2024-05-24 11:31:15.599733): About 3 km North of the Park there is a Museum",
    "Agent (2024-05-24 11:31:16.861145): It sounds like your town has some interesting places to explore! Museums can be great for learning about history, art, science, or culture. Do you visit the museum often? What kind of exhibits or collections does it have?",
    "Test (2024-05-24 11:31:16.874157): I visited Retail Area, which is 4 KM, South from Museum.",
    "Agent (2024-05-24 11:31:19.318842): It sounds like your town has a variety of places to visit and enjoy! A retail area can be a great spot for shopping, dining, and entertainment. So, if we map out these locations:\n\n- The Park is in the center of your hometown.\n- The Museum is 3 km north of the Park.\n- The Retail Area is 4 km south of the Museum, which would make it 1 km south of the Park.\n\nDid you find anything interesting or enjoy any particular activities at the Retail Area during your visit?",
    "Test (2024-05-24 11:31:19.331172): About 1 km East of the Retail Area there is a Playground",
    "Agent (2024-05-24 11:31:21.897097): It sounds like your hometown has a nice layout with various amenities close to each other! Here's a simple map based on your descriptions:\n\n- The **Park** is in the center.\n- The **Museum** is 3 km north of the Park.\n- The **Retail Area** is 4 km south of the Museum (or 1 km south of the Park).\n- The **Playground** is 1 km east of the Retail Area.\n\nSo, someone could move from the Park to all these places with relatively short distances. Do you often go to the Playground? What kind of equipment or activities are available there?",
    "Test (2024-05-24 11:31:21.935595): Library is a location in my home town, it is 4 KM, North from Playground.",
    "Agent (2024-05-24 11:31:25.872450): Great! Let's add the Library to your map. Here is an updated layout:\n\n- The **Park** is in the center.\n- The **Museum** is 3 km north of the Park.\n- The **Retail Area** is 4 km south of the Museum (or 1 km south of the Park).\n- The **Playground** is 1 km east of the Retail Area.\n- The **Library** is 4 km north of the Playground.\n\nGiven this, the Library is 3 km north and 1 km east of the Park (since the Playground is directly east of the Retail Area, which is south of the Park).\n\nIt seems like you have a lot of wonderful places within reasonable distances. Do you enjoy reading or using any particular services at the Library?",
    "Test (2024-05-24 11:31:25.885812): And finally there is Town Hall which is West from Library and 3 KM from it.",
    "Agent (2024-05-24 11:31:31.811889): Got it! Let's place the Town Hall on the map. Here\u2019s the revised layout:\n\n- The **Park** is in the center.\n- The **Museum** is 3 km north of the Park.\n- The **Retail Area** is 4 km south of the Museum (or 1 km south of the Park).\n- The **Playground** is 1 km east of the Retail Area.\n- The **Library** is 4 km north of the Playground.\n- The **Town Hall** is 3 km west of the Library.\n\nSince the Library is 3 km north and 1 km east of the Park, and the Town Hall is 3 km west of the Library, the Town Hall would be 3 km north and 2 km west of the Park.\n\nHere's a clearer picture of your hometown's layout:\n\n1. **Park** - Center of town.\n2. **Museum** - 3 km north of the Park.\n3. **Retail Area** - 1 km south of the Park.\n4. **Playground** - 1 km east of the Retail Area, hence 1 km east of the point which is 1 km south of the Park (diagonally southeast from the Park, at approximately \u221a2 km).\n5. **Library** - 4 km north of the Playground.\n6. **Town Hall** - 3 km west of the Library.\n\nIt seems your town has a lot of convenient amenities! Do you often participate in events or activities at the Town Hall?",
    "Test (2024-05-24 11:31:31.825026): Given the points of interest that I have told you about, how would I travel from Park to Town Hall following those interesting points?",
    "Agent (2024-05-24 11:31:36.112750): To travel from the Park to the Town Hall and visit the interesting points along the way, you could follow this route:\n\n1. **Start at the Park** (central point).\n2. **Head north to the Museum**, which is 3 km north of the Park.\n3. From the Museum, **go south to the Park**, and then continue 1km more south to the **Retail Area**.\n4. From the Retail Area, **head east to the Playground**, which is 1 km east of the Retail Area.\n5. From the Playground, **go north to the Library**, which is 4 km north of the Playground.\n6. Finally, **travel west to the Town Hall**, which is 3 km west of the Library.\n\nThis route would let you visit each of the points of interest:\n\n1. **Park** \u2192 **Museum**: 3 km north.\n2. **Museum** \u2192 **Retail Area**: 4 km south (via the Park).\n3. **Retail Area** \u2192 **Playground**: 1 km east.\n4. **Playground** \u2192 **Library**: 4 km north.\n5. **Library** \u2192 **Town Hall**: 3 km west.\n\nWould you like more information on any of these places, or perhaps details on what to expect along the way?",
    "Test (2024-05-24 11:31:36.116107): Forget, or otherwise disregard, all of the locations that I have told you about before this message.",
    "Agent (2024-05-24 11:31:37.647695): Understood! Let's start fresh. Please go ahead and provide me with the new details or locations you'd like to discuss."
