    "Agent (2024-05-24 11:35:53.233413): Great! Buying potatoes is usually quite simple. Here are a few steps to help you:\n\n1. **Decide Where to Buy**:\n   - **Grocery Store**: Most supermarkets and grocery stores carry potatoes in the produce section.\n   - **Farmers' Market**: If you prefer locally grown produce, a farmers' market is a great option.\n   - **Convenience Store**: Smaller stores might also carry potatoes, though the selection may be limited.\n\n2. **Choose Your Potatoes**:\n   - **Type**: Consider the type of potato you want (e.g., russet, red, Yukon gold, etc.). Each type has different uses (baking, mashing, frying, etc.).\n   - **Quality**: Look for potatoes that are firm, smooth, and free of sprouts or green spots.\n\n3. **Purchase**:\n   - Simply place the two potatoes in a bag or cart and head to the checkout.\n\n4. **Payment**:\n   - Pay for your potatoes using cash, debit, or credit card, depending on the store\u2019s accepted payment methods.\n\nIs there a specific type of potato you are looking for, or any other details you need help with?",
    "Test (2024-05-24 11:35:53.236101): I want to buy 1 Steak.",
    "Agent (2024-05-24 11:36:00.485354): Buying a steak can be a delightful experience, and it\u2019s important to choose the right cut and quality for your needs. Here are the steps to help you with purchasing a steak:\n\n1. **Decide Where to Buy**:\n   - **Grocery Store**: Most supermarkets have a meat section where you can find a variety of steaks.\n   - **Butcher Shop**: If you want a high-quality cut and expert advice, a local butcher shop can be a great option.\n   - **Farmer's Market**: Some farmer's markets have vendors who sell fresh, locally-raised meats.\n\n2. **Choose Your Steak**:\n   - **Cut**: There are many cuts of steak, each with different textures and flavors. Common cuts include ribeye, sirloin, filet mignon, New York strip, and T-bone. Decide which cut you prefer based on how you plan to cook it and your personal taste.\n   - **Quality**: Look for steaks with good marbling (the white streaks of fat within the meat), as this typically enhances flavor and tenderness. Also, check for freshness and avoid meat that looks discolored or smells off.\n   - **Thickness**: Consider how thick you want the steak to be. Thicker steaks (at least 1 inch or more) are generally better for grilling and searing.\n\n3. **Purchase**:\n   - Talk to the butcher if you have questions about the different cuts or need a recommendation.\n   - Select your steak and make sure it is properly wrapped.\n\n4. **Payment**:\n   - Pay for your steak at the checkout using cash, debit, or credit card, depending on the store\u2019s accepted payment methods.\n\n5. **Storage**:\n   - Keep your steak refrigerated if you plan to cook it soon, or freeze it if you intend to use it later.\n\nDo you know which cut of steak you want, or do you need advice on which one to choose?",
