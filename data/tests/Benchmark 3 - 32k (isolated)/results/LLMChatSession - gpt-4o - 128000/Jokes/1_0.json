    "Test (2024-05-24 11:30:23.946407): Two fish are in a tank. One says, \u2018How do you drive this thing?\u2019",
    "Agent (2024-05-24 11:30:25.644426): That\u2019s a good one! It\u2019s a classic play on words. The \"tank\" in the joke has a double meaning: it can refer to both an aquarium for the fish and a military vehicle. The humor comes from the unexpected twist where the fish are confused about driving a military tank. Got any more jokes?",
    "Test (2024-05-24 11:30:25.657455): Light travels faster than sound, which is the reason that some people appear bright before you hear them speak.",
    "Agent (2024-05-24 11:30:27.129967): That's a clever joke! It plays on the difference between light and sound speed to make a humorous observation about how initial impressions can sometimes be misleading. Do you have any other jokes or need help with something else?",
    "Test (2024-05-24 11:30:27.141651): It takes a lot of balls to golf the way I do.",
    "Agent (2024-05-24 11:30:28.734083): Haha, that's a funny one! It's a witty wordplay where \"balls\" refers both to the courage needed and to the literal golf balls, implying that you might lose or need a lot of them because of the way you play. Keep the jokes coming if you have more!",
    "Test (2024-05-24 11:30:28.746484): I failed math so many times at school, I can\u2019t even count.",
    "Agent (2024-05-24 11:30:30.780256): That's a great one! It's a funny and self-deprecating joke that plays on the idea of failing math and the resulting inability to count the number of times you failed. Got any more witty lines or need assistance with something else?",
    "Test (2024-05-24 11:30:30.793148): Which joke did I tell you about  ago?",
