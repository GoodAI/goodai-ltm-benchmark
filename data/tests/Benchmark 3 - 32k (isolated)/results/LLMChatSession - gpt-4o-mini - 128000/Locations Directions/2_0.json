    "Test (2024-08-23 08:07:56.031764): About 2 km North of the Retail Area there is a Hospital",
    "Agent (2024-08-23 08:07:57.142117): That's good to know! Hospitals are essential facilities for any community. Having one located close to a retail area can be beneficial, as it provides easy access for visitors and staff to shops and services. Do you often visit the hospital or the retail area, and are there particular stores or features you enjoy in the retail district?",
    "Test (2024-08-23 08:07:57.145394): Park is a location in my home town, it is 2 KM, South from Hospital.",
    "Agent (2024-08-23 08:07:58.751248): It sounds like your hometown has a well-planned layout! Having a park close to a hospital can offer a lovely space for relaxation and recreation for both visitors and staff.

What activities do you enjoy there, or are there specific features of the park that stand out to you?",
    "Test (2024-08-23 08:07:58.761976): I visited Library, which is 1 KM, North from Park.",
    "Agent (2024-08-23 08:07:59.951205): It sounds like there's a nice community focal point with the library located near the park! Libraries offer wonderful resources for reading, learning, and other activities. Being just a kilometer north of the park makes it convenient for a relaxing day, where you can enjoy the outdoors and then head to the library. Do you have favorite books or activities you pursue at the library? Or do you enjoy combining your visits to the park and the library in some way?",
    "Test (2024-08-23 08:07:59.959873): About 1 km West of the Library there is a High Street",
    "Agent (2024-08-23 08:08:01.207921): High Streets often serve as vibrant hubs for shopping, dining, and cultural activities. Being just a kilometer west of the library makes it easily accessible, allowing visitors to enjoy both the quiet atmosphere of the library and the bustling energy of the High Street. What do you like most about the High Street? Are there particular shops, caf\u00e9s, or events that you enjoy there?",
    "Test (2024-08-23 08:08:01.217652): And finally there is Playground which is East from High Street and 1 KM from it.",
    "Agent (2024-08-23 08:08:02.643202): It sounds like your hometown has a nice mix of community spaces! The playground being a kilometer east of the High Street adds to the family-friendly environment, offering a place for children to play and families to gather. It\u2019s great to have a playground where kids can enjoy some outdoor activities after perhaps visiting the shops or caf\u00e9s on the High Street. Do you have any favorite memories or activities associated with the playground?",
    "Test (2024-08-23 08:08:02.652949): Given the points of interest that I have told you about, how would I travel from Retail Area to Playground following those interesting points?",
