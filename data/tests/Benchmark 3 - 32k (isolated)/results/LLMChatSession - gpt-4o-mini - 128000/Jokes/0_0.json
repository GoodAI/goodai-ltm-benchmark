    "Test (2024-08-22 09:41:53.925930): Two fish are in a tank. One says, \u2018How do you drive this thing?\u2019",
    "Agent (2024-08-22 09:41:55.041621): That's a classic joke! The humor comes from the play on words\u2014fish are in a tank, but instead of a fish tank, the punchline implies they are in a vehicle tank, like a military tank. It's a fun twist that catches you off guard! Would you like to hear more jokes?",

    "Agent (2024-08-22 12:36:57.387952): That's a good one! The humor lies in the unexpected twist\u2014burning calories is usually associated with exercise, but in this case, it's about literally burning brownies in the oven. It's a clever play on words! If you're interested, I can share more jokes or puns like that!",

    "Agent (2024-08-22 14:25:58.912796): That's a great one! The humor comes from the double meaning of \"put my foot down.\" It references a flamingo's distinctive standing position on one leg, while also conveying a sense of authority or finality. It's a clever pun! Would you like to hear more jokes in a similar style?",
    "Test (2024-08-22 16:17:58.913880): It takes a lot of balls to golf the way I do.",
    "Agent (2024-08-22 16:17:59.929895): That's a clever play on words! The humor arises from the double meaning of \"balls\"\u2014referring both to golf balls and the idea of having courage or bravado to play golf in an unconventional or risky manner. It's a fun and cheeky joke! If you want more golf jokes or anything else, just let me know!",
