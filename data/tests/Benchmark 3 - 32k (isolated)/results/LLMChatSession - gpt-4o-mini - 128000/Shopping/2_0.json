    "Agent (2024-08-23 08:10:29.074689): If you're looking to buy two potatoes, you can check your local grocery store, farmer's market, or a nearby convenience store. Potatoes are often sold by weight or in bags, so you might not find exactly two for sale, but you can buy a small quantity or just a single potato if that's an option. Would you like tips on how to select good potatoes or ideas for recipes?",
    "Test (2024-08-23 08:10:29.085486): I want to buy 1 Steak.",
    "Agent (2024-08-23 08:10:32.352946): To buy one steak, you can visit your local grocery store, butcher, or meat market. Here are some tips for selecting a good steak:\n\n1. **Type of Steak**: Decide on the type of steak you want (e.g., ribeye, sirloin, filet mignon, T-bone) as each has its own flavor and tenderness.\n\n2. **Freshness**: Look for bright red color and firm texture. Avoid steaks that are browning or have a slimy texture.\n\n3. **Marbling**: Check for marbling, which are the thin streaks of fat within the meat. More marbling usually means more flavor and tenderness.\n\n4. **Thickness**: If you're grilling or pan-searing, a steak that's about 1 to 1.5 inches thick is often ideal for achieving a good sear while keeping it juicy inside.\n\n5. **Aging**: Some steaks may be labeled as \"dry-aged\" or \"wet-aged.\" Dry-aged steaks tend to have a more intense flavor.\n\nAfter selecting, you can ask the butcher for cooking tips if you need them. Enjoy your steak! If you have any questions about cooking it, just let me know!",

    "Agent (2024-08-23 08:10:36.242329): If you want to buy one roll of toilet paper, you can find it at most grocery stores, pharmacies, big box retailers, and convenience stores. However, toilet paper is often sold in packs, so it may be challenging to find just one roll unless you check a store with bulk buying options or specific household items.\n\nHere are a few tips for selecting toilet paper:\n\n1. **Ply Count**: Toilet paper usually comes in 1-ply, 2-ply, or 3-ply. Higher ply counts tend to be thicker and softer.\n\n2. **Roll Size**: Regular rolls or jumbo rolls are available, and jumbo rolls have more sheets, so they last longer.\n\n3. **Brand**: Different brands offer variations in softness, thickness, and durability. You may want to choose a brand you've used before or ask about recommendations.\n\n4. **Recycled Options**: If you're eco-conscious, look for toilet paper made from recycled materials.\n\nYou can also check online retailers for individual rolls if you prefer not to go to a store.
