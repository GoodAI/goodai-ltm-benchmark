    "Test (2024-08-23 08:08:28.960200): 'Do not go where the path may lead, go instead where there is no path and leave a trail.' - Ralph Waldo Emerson",
    "Agent (2024-08-23 08:08:30.131644): This quote from Ralph Waldo Emerson encourages individuality and boldness in one's choices. Rather than following the conventional routes that others have taken, it advocates for forging one's own path and creating new opportunities.
