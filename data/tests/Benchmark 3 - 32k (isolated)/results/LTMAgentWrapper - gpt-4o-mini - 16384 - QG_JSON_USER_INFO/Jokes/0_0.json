    "Test (2024-08-19 15:30:29.635729): Two fish are in a tank. One says, \u2018How do you drive this thing?\u2019",
    "Agent (2024-08-19 15:30:34.015330): That's a classic joke! The humor comes from the play on words\u2014fish are in a tank, which is typically a container for water, but \"tank\" can also refer to a military vehicle. The fish's question humorously suggests that they are trying to operate the tank as if it were a vehicle. It's a clever pun!",
    "Test (2024-08-19 18:25:34.017796): Just burned 2,000 calories. That\u2019s the last time I leave brownies in the oven while I nap.",
    "Agent (2024-08-19 18:25:38.133574): That's a funny twist! It plays on the idea of \"burning calories\" through exercise, but in this case, it's about literally burning brownies in the oven. It's a clever way to highlight a cooking mishap while making light of it. Just remember to set a timer next time!",
    "Test (2024-08-19 20:14:38.153232): My wife told me to stop impersonating a flamingo. I had to put my foot down.",
    "Agent (2024-08-19 20:14:42.311285): That's a great one! The humor comes from the double meaning of \"put my foot down.\" It refers to both taking a stand in the conversation and the literal act of a flamingo standing on one leg. It's a clever play on words! Keep the jokes coming!",
    "Test (2024-08-19 22:06:42.323845): It takes a lot of balls to golf the way I do.",
    "Agent (2024-08-19 22:06:46.358429): That's a clever one! It plays on the double meaning of \"balls\"\u2014referring to both golf balls and the courage or audacity it takes to play golf in a unique or unconventional way. It's a fun way to express confidence on the golf course!",
    "Test (2024-08-20 00:27:46.375981): Which joke did I tell you about 2 hours 21 minutes  ago?",
    "Agent (2024-08-20 00:28:05.437856): About 2 hours and 21 minutes ago, you told me the joke: \"It takes a lot of balls to golf the way I do.\""
