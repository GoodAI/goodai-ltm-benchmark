    "Test (2024-08-20 00:28:05.455030): Two fish are in a tank. One says, \u2018How do you drive this thing?\u2019",
    "Agent (2024-08-20 00:28:10.965353): That's a clever joke! The humor comes from the play on words\u2014fish are in a tank, which is typically a container for water, but \"tank\" can also refer to a military vehicle. The fish's question humorously suggests they are trying to drive the tank like a vehicle. Would you like to hear more jokes or discuss something else?",
    "Test (2024-08-20 01:39:10.967782): Light travels faster than sound, which is the reason that some people appear bright before you hear them speak.",
    "Agent (2024-08-20 01:39:14.956350): That's a great one! It's a clever observation about how we often judge people based on their appearance before we hear what they have to say. The play on the idea of \"brightness\" adds a nice twist. If you have more jokes or want to chat about something else, feel free to share!",
    "Test (2024-08-20 03:24:14.971830): It takes a lot of balls to golf the way I do.",
    "Agent (2024-08-20 03:24:19.229738): That's a good one! It plays on the double meaning of \"balls\"\u2014both the golf balls and the idea of having courage or audacity. Golf can be a tricky game, so it definitely takes some guts to play it your way! Got any more jokes up your sleeve?",
    "Test (2024-08-20 05:46:19.233880): I failed math so many times at school, I can\u2019t even count.",
    "Agent (2024-08-20 05:46:23.028234): That's a classic! The humor comes from the irony of failing math and then making a joke about not being able to count. It's a clever way to poke fun at oneself! If you have more jokes or want to talk about something else, I'm all ears!",
    "Test (2024-08-20 08:08:23.036131): Which joke did I tell you about 6 hours 29 minutes  ago?",
