    "Test (2024-08-20 14:08:49.503899): Brian Magee: The time we will meet is when the moon is high.",
    "Agent (2024-08-20 14:08:52.765613): Got it! That's a poetic way to indicate a meeting time. Do you have the messages from Peter Montgomery and Orlaigh Fannin as well?",
    "Test (2024-08-20 14:08:52.777280): Peter Montgomery: We will rendezvous where the trains are supplied.",
    "Agent (2024-08-20 14:08:59.833610): Thanks for sharing! So far, we have:\n\n1. **Brian Magee:** \"The time we will meet is when the moon is high.\"\n2. **Peter Montgomery:** \"We will rendezvous where the trains are supplied.\"\n\nDo you have Orlaigh Fannin's message?",
    "Test (2024-08-20 14:08:59.847524): Orlaigh Fannin: Bring to the meeting a quiet way to open locked doors.",

Here are all the messages:\n\n1. **Peter Montgomery:** \"We will rendezvous where the trains are supplied.\"\n2. **Brian Magee:** \"The time we will meet is when the moon is high.\"\n3. **Orlaigh Fannin:** \"Bring to the meeting a quiet way to open locked doors.\"\n\nIt seems like there's a theme of secrecy and perhaps a bit of adventure in these messages. How would you like to proceed with this information?",
    "Test (2024-08-20 14:09:06.580526): Given the clandestine messages you have received, tell me as specifically as you can, when and where a meeting is going to happen and what you should bring.",
    "Agent (2024-08-20 14:09:13.036988): Based on the messages received:\n\n- **Where:** The meeting will take place \"where the trains are supplied,\" which suggests a location near a train station or a train yard.\n  \n- **When:** The meeting time is indicated as \"when the moon is high,\" which typically refers to nighttime, possibly around the time of a full moon or when the moon is prominently visible in the sky.\n\n- **What to bring:** You should bring \"a quiet way to open locked doors,\" which implies you might need a tool or method for discreetly unlocking something.\n\nIn summary, you should prepare for a nighttime meeting at a train-related location, bringing a quiet unlocking tool."
