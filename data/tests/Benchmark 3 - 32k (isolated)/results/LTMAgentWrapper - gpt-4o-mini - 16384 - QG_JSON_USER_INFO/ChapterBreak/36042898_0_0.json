    "Test (2024-08-19 15:21:53.799938): 1st page:\n\n\t1. Day 1    The medal felt heavy on her neck, but the weight of the situation she found herself in weighted more. She tried to smile looking at her training partner on her side, Alina was wearing the gold medal, she had been wearing the gold medal in every competition the last couple of months & although she wanted to be happy for her, she couldn\u2019t help but think in how this would affect her future. Just in their training team with Eteri they had two young girls doing quads, she couldn\u2019t even perfect the triple lutz, how she was going to manage to get to that level in the years to come. \u201cSilver medal is a big achievement\u201d, she tried to tell herself, but the truth is that it felt like a death sentence. It felt like the ending of an unsatisfying journey, she knew the reality of her country in her field, everyday there was a new girl, training as hard as her, younger & better than her. She felt like an used car just waiting to be discarded. An old model who knew her time was up. She had been dedicating her whole life to a sport just to lose it in a matter of minutes, she wanted to be hopeful, to have faith in herself but her last year as a senior was taking a toll on her. She was not only physically exhausted, but also mentally and emotionally tired, \u201cand the season hasn\u2019t even ended yet\u201d, she reminded herself. She still had the Worlds to focus on & she wasn\u2019t sure she could beat Alina there, she wasn\u2019t sure if she would be able to beat her ever again, that\u2019s how crushed she felt. While the anthem of the Olympics played, she saw Eteri from a distance looking at her & Alina, she had a calm expression on her face, saving her thoughts to herself about their results. Eteri had been her coach since she was 6 & although she was friends with her mom & a mentor to her, she never played favourites, she had to earn her respect with every training & every performance. But she knew that now that she lost 2 competitions in a row to Alina, things weren\u2019t looking good for her, especially because soon her competition was going to be tougher with Anna (Scherbakova) & Alexandra (Trusova) close to making their senior debuts. After the medal ceremony ended at Pyeong Chang, Evgenia returned quickly to Eteri\u2019s side while Alina walked slowly behind her. They had to start getting ready for the gala, if she was honest with herself, she didn\u2019t want to participate, she just wanted to be alone, maybe put some ice on her foot that was still not completely healed. She wished she could sleep until the end of the season, if she won gold she could afford to miss the Worlds, but she didn\u2019t, so she had to work hard to maintain herself relevant. But would it be worth it? In two to three years she would have to compete with little girls who could do quads in their sleep. The future look depressing whenever she thought about it. While returning to their hotel to change for practices, Evgenia put on her headphones to avoid interacting with anyone, both Alina & Eteri had been quiet after the ceremony, but that wasn\u2019t rare, Alina was a quiet girl by nature & Eteri wasn\u2019t that talkative either, only during practice she was blunt, after that she only talked when necessary. Normally, she would take on the job of filling the silence, but today she didn\u2019t want to talk, she just wanted to sulk & listen to some music. So she got lost in the music of EXO & closed her eyes. Two hours later they were at the rink, getting ready to practice their exhibition numbers, Evgenia was getting ready to hit the ice when Eteri stopped her. -\u201cAlina is going first today\u201d, she said softly but sternly. Evgenia looked at her atonished before asking why. Eteri simply said, \u201cyou know why\u201d, before walking to Alina\u2019s side to give her some instructions. Evgenia waited outside the rink while Alina worked with Eteri on her \u201cAfro Blue\u201d exhibition number, but she wasn\u2019t looking at Alina, instead she was going through the steps of her program on her mind, remembering each step, trying to analyze how to make her program more complex so it could be more competitive. This was her life, one competition at a time, a whole life dedicated to a sport so it could be reduced to 4 minutes of the world watching & judging. When it was her turn & she stepped to the ice, she closed her eyes to get ready for the same program she had at the exhibitions of the European Championships, it was going to be \u201cKukushka\u201d, the song that represented her journey, the song that represented how she felt at that moment. She tried to put everything behind her, \u201cdon\u2019t look back\u201d she said to herself, she opened her eyes & started everything again. \t2. Day 2    When she opened her eyes, she knew she didn\u2019t felt ready for a new day, the day before it had been the medal ceremony & also her first day of practice for the Exhibition Gala of the Olympics. She practiced with all her heart, she jumped until her legs felt numb because she wanted to tire her body, she wanted to feel tired enough to quiet the doubts of her mind, so she could sleep in peace, so she didn\u2019t fear the uncertainty of her future. The alarm of her cellphone went off at that second reminding her she only had 30 minutes to get ready. They had to leave in one hour to the main rink at Gangneung to practice with the rest of the athletes for their group number at the Gala. This put a smile on her face, she was going to see Misha & Yuzuru there, it still broke her heart that Wakaba wasn\u2019t able to make it to the Olympics, she could have used one of her hugs right now. Checking the clock on her cellphone she realized she lost too much time lost in her thoughts, so she quickly left her bed to start her day. Two hours later she couldn\u2019t stop smiling watching everyone enjoying the practice for the Gala. Everyone at the rink was in a good mood, no one thought about what was going to happen in their futures after the Olympics, they stopped thinking about their falls & mistakes, about the ones who would retire after the Gala, at that moment they were all kids at the playground & that playground was the ice. Just like her, everyone at the rink had dedicated their lives to this sport, to this dream & at that moment she felt ashamed of herself, for not feeling it was enough. Just being here it was a dream, how many girls wanted to be in her position, Wakaba herself couldn\u2019t get a spot on her team, so what if she didn\u2019t win gold, she gave her all. \u201cBut my all wasn\u2019t enough\u201d whispered the doubts on her mind. Today it wasn\u2019t about thinking about her failures, today she was going to enjoy the moment, so she put a smile on her face, the same smile that didn\u2019t reach her heart, but it didn\u2019t matter, because even if she felt empty inside, she was going to enjoy this day, she was going to create memories she would treasure for the rest of her life. -\u201cDo you want to do a jump competition?\u201d asked a playful voice next to her, distracting her from her thoughts. She turned her head to see Misha smiling at her & she laughed before joining his playful mood to say   \\- \u201cI don\u2019t know, I don\u2019t want you to get hurt, we all know joints start to ache at 26\u201d. He laughed before continuing their game   \\- \u201cAre you calling me old Medvedeva\u201d. She put on her best poker face before saying   -\u201cSo it\u2019s not only your joints that hurt, you\u2019re also bad at hearing, I feel so sorry for you Misha\u201d. Immediately after saying that, she felt his hands on her hips & she felt her weight leaving the ice before she realized Misha was carrying her & laughing loudly. -\u201cPut me down Misha\u201d she said a little bit scared. \\- \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I had a big breakfast, so I\u2019m still strong\u201d he said with a smile. -\u201cAre you guys going to try pair figure skating now?\u201d asked a voice next to them, that belonged to the Yuzuru Hanyu, someone Evgenia still couldn\u2019t believe she was able to call a friend. -\u201cWhy, are you jealous?\u201d asked Misha, \u201cdon\u2019t believe I forgot how Ondrej (Hotarek) carried you yesterday\u201d, he said joking, while carefully putting Evgenia back on the ice. \\- \u201cOndrej carried this kid?\u201d asked Zhenya with a smile. -\u201cEverybody wants to carry me because I\u2019m cute\u201d joked Yuzuru. \\- \u201cI always knew that Ondrej was one of your fangirls\u201d teased Evgenia. \\- \u201cMaybe he would get you a new Pooh bear\u201d said Misha, joining Evgenia on her teasing. Yuzuru just laughed as he always did & Evgenia couldn\u2019t help but think how lucky she was to be able to share this kind of moments with them. \u201cTreasure this moments because they are not going to last\u201d, said the treacherous voice on her head, but she refused to listen, not today, she said to herself. \u201cToday my fears are not going to take over\u201d, she repeated as a mantra on her mind. So to quiet her doubts, she skated close to Yuzuru & Misha and asked \u201cso, are you ready for this jump competition?\u201d. \t3. Day 3    The night of the Gala felt like a pause on her life. Like time had stop over to give her a break. She walked around backstage excited of seeing everyone while they got ready. It was strange to not feel nerves, but tonight it wasn\u2019t a competition, tonight it was about enjoying the ice. Performing was what she had done through her whole life, bringing joy to people through her hardwork it was an indescribable feeling, a feeling she didn\u2019t want to give up. -\u201cYou look happy\u201d said a voice behind her. She turned & saw Yuzuru looking at her. He had a smile on his face, because Yuzuru without a smile wasn\u2019t the Yuzuru she knew. -\u201cI\u2019m happy to see everyone happy\u201d she said a little bit shyly, she always felt timid when she was alone with Yuzuru, it was easier when Misha was around, but being alone with him made her nervous. -\u201cI like your outfit\u201d he said, before picking her hood & putting it on her head. \\- \u201cWe can exchange outfits if you want\u201d she said smiling while putting her hood back in its place, \u201cI\u2019m sure the feathers would suit me better than you\u201d. \\- \u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d he answered, \u201cno one is as badass as you\u201d. Evgenia stayed silent because she didn\u2019t know how to answer. It was easy to go for the joke, but when he was earnest, he destroyed all of her walls. -\u201cI wanted to congratulate you\u201d he said softly, taking a step closer to her. \\- \u201cFor what\u201d she asked quietly. \\- \u201cGetting silver of course\u201d he said gently & she felt the understanding on his voice. -\u201cThank you\u201d she said while looking at the floor \u201cbut you\u2019re the one that should get all the praises, two golds is not a small feature Yuzuru\u201d. -\u201cYou don\u2019t have to pretend\u201d he said in a whisper & she felt the air leaving her lungs as if someone had punched her. \u201cI know it\u2019s hard, what you did that day, it\u2019s worth more than a medal, you\u2019re a champion Zhenya, never forget it\u201d he said carefully. She looked up not caring anymore he would see the tears in her eyes & she saw the surprise on his face when she went for a hug. -\u201cI\u2019m sorry\u201d she said softly in his arms, she tried to let go because she had acted on impulse, but she felt him hugging her even tighter. \\- \u201cDon\u2019t apologize, we all need a hug sometimes\u201d he told her gently finally letting go. -\u201cI know those hugs are exclusive for Pooh-san\u201d she joked while wiping the tears from her eyes. -\u201cHe told me he can share the hugs with you & with Luna-chan\u201d he told her in a voice that warmed her heart, she was no match for him, her heart ran wild & beat harder than ever, so she said in a whisper \u201cI think I\u2019m ok with that\u201d. During the rest of the evening she could feel the eyes of Yuzuru following her at times, she knew she surprised him with the hug. They have hugged before but this was different because this time it felt like he was consoling her, so it felt more intimate. She tried to calm herself as she always did, with skating, she started going back on the steps for her program on her mind, she repeated the choreography on loop on her memory while listening to Kukushka on her ipod. She usually listened to Exo before the competitions but tonight she wasn\u2019t competing, she wasn\u2019t even performing, because she wasn\u2019t planning to portray anyone but herself through her program, she was going to express something she couldn\u2019t put into words, something she felt in her heart. This is what skating was for her, not only the sport that she dedicated her life to, but also the place where she could be herself. Even when she played a character there was always a little bit of herself in every show, in every step, in every turn & in every jump. Tonight, her heart was going to stay on the ice. She stayed close to the rink when Gabriella & Guillaume took the ice. She had been watching everyone\u2019s program, from Javier\u2019s fun \u201cAerobic class\u201d to the romantic performance of Han & Sui with \u201cRun\u201d. She wanted to take it all, because this moment with everyone relaxing & smiling was rare, in less than a month they had to be in Milan for the World Championships & she wasn\u2019t looking forward to it. This would be the last day to relax before she started training for her next competition. That had been her routine for the last four years, competitions during the winter & fall seasons and shows & training through the summer. Time passed by, people changed but ice was always there, as a permanent feature on her life. As she saw Gabriella & Guillaume finish their performance to \u201cPray you catch me\u201d she got ready to be next. It was always difficult to get back to perform for an audience after a disappointing result in competition, especially when it was an exhibition that relied more in engaging the audience than just concentrating in the technical side of her program. Luckily, she didn\u2019t have to smile or be flirty for \u201cKukushka\u201d, the dark themes of the song suited the state of her soul at the moment, so it was easy to get lost in the tempo of the song. She skated slowly to the center of the rink after Gabriella & Guillaume left the ice, she could see the flashes, hear the announcer calling her name, she could feel the eyes of every person in the arena, but at that moment she erased them all. This was not a performance for them, this was for herself. To remind herself why she still dedicated her life to this profession, why even after the biggest disappointment in her life she couldn\u2019t imagine doing anything else but going back to what she knew. This was who she is & this was what she wanted to continue doing for as long as she could. She closed her eyes & when she heard the first notes of the song, she felt ready to tell a story through her art again. \t4. Day 15    She could feel every muscle in her body ache at the end of her practice, she had one more week to train before the World Figure Skating Championship started & her goal of revalidating her gold medal there seemed to be more far away than ever",
    "Agent (2024-08-19 15:21:57.920128): I'm here, listening. Please continue whenever you're ready!",
    "Test (2024-08-19 15:21:57.973176): 2nd page:\n\n-\u201cEvgenia\u201d, she heard the voice of Eteri calling her. She skated slowly to the end of the rink where she was standing to hear the reviews of her training. -\u201cYour landings are off\u201d she said severely, \u201cif you don\u2019t have secure landings, you cannot do the combinations\u201d, she reminded her. \u201cYou need to stay later tomorrow to practice if you want to catch up to Alina\u201d, she said sternly before turning & walking down to her office. This was common with Eteri, always pointing down the mistakes, but never praising her skaters when things went well, she should be used by now, but sometimes she wished she could get a word of encouragement. She turned to the ice & saw Alina leaving the rink quietly. -\u201cAre you alright?\u201d asked Alina as soon as she reached her. -\u201cYes, thank you. I\u2019m just tired\u201d, answered Zhenya before walking to the dressing rooms to pick her things so she could go home. As she left the gym, she saw her mom\u2019s car in the parking lot. She always made time to take her to trainings & pick her up everyday, that\u2019s why she felt she had no right to complain. Her mom had already sacrificed enough to make her dreams come true, so the least she could do is to deliver in what has become the dream of both of them. -\u201dHey honey, how was practice?\u201d, her mom asked as soon as she got in the car. -\u201cIt was good, I feel I\u2019m improving\u201d she said without looking at her mom in the eyes while pretending to be busy with her phone. That was a bad habit she had, everytime she felt she couldn\u2019t be honest, she looked at the floor or anywhere else to avoid the eyes of the person she couldn't be sincere to. Wakaba once told her that the expressiveness of her face was her biggest curse but also her biggest weapon. On the ice it was a great help when she needed to portray a character, but on real life it presented a problem because it meant anyone could read her like a book. -\u201cEteri called me this morning\u201d said her mom, taking her out of her thoughts. -\u201cWhy?\u201d, she asked softly, fearing her answer   -\u201cShe told me you are having problems with your landings & she\u2019s worried\u201d, she told her while starting the car   Evgenia didn\u2019t answer, didn\u2019t confirm her mom\u2019s suspicions because if she vocalized her fears, she knew she would crumble, so she stayed silent until her mom spoke again. -\u201cEteri said that there are only two reasons this could be happening & let\u2019s hope it\u2019s not the worst case scenario\u201d she told her in a tone that worried her   -\u201cwhat is the worst case scenario?\u201d, she asked with fear   -\u201cSkaters start to lose precision & flexibility with age, you\u2019re getting older so it\u2019s normal you cannot jump as easily as other skaters younger than you, the problem is that this would mean you already reached your peak\u201d she said in a straight tone. When her mom put the facts so bluntly she really hated to be the daughter of a former figure skater, if her mom had been just a housewife like Alina\u2019s grandmother maybe she could be more supportive. But that wasn\u2019t the nature of her mom, she always went straight to the point, which might be the reason why she was close with Eteri, they were both painfully frank. -\u201cwhat is the best case scenario?\u201d she asked hopefully   -\u201cthat you might be injured\u201d she answered candidly. Evgenia felt the tears in her eyes, but held it together & simply said   -\u201cthen let\u2019s hope for the best case scenario\u201d before putting on her headphones on & staying silent until they reached home. As soon as she reached the apartment she shared with her mom, she took her shoes off & started walking to her bedroom but the voice of her mother made her stop   -\u201cYou don\u2019t want dinner?\u201d her mom asked while closing the door of their home. -\u201cYou know I can\u2019t eat after 6, least of all so close to competition\u201d, she answered dryly before continuing her way to her bedroom. As soon as she arrived to her destination, she saw a small package on her bed & while picking up the small gift she saw a simple note that said \u201cTo Zhenya-chan\u201d. When she opened carefully the wrapping paper she saw that inside there was a cute necklace of a moon & next to it a note that said   \u201cThis is your belated Olympic gift, you\u2019re always gold in our hearts, gambatte Zhenya-chan! With love   M & Y\u201d   She smiled to herself & immediately reached for her phone to write to her boys. When the world looked bleak they always put a smile on her face, this was a reminder of what she held dear, after this there was only one way, she was going to fight for a chance. \t5. Day 24    It was loud on the arena, louder than any normal competition, because this wasn\u2019t any normal competition, this was the World\u2019s Championship. After the Olympics, this was the biggest accomplishment any athlete on her field could get. She had already won it twice & she should be relaxed at this stage by now, but this year, after everything than unraveled, this felt like a test. Is this the end of Evgenia Medvedeva? That\u2019s the question everyone in the media was asking. If she lost, it not only reinforced the idea that Alina had come to take her place, but also it would erase what she accomplished, she would be another story to add to the older figure skater losing her place to someone younger narrative. Maybe Eteri was right & she already reached her peak before the Olympics. For two years, she was on the top of her field, but not anymore & although she was still in the podium she knew it was just a matter of time until one of the juniors of her country became a senior & started making things more complicated for her with quads. She made sure to avoid the media while getting ready for the World\u2019s, she didn\u2019t want anything to distract her from her training, but everyday Eteri informed her of new requests for interviews with Alina. The media was enjoying their rivalry & with Yuzuru not participating at the World Championship, the media made sure to hype the battle of the Russian Ladies as much as they could. But that wasn\u2019t what worried her, but the lack of stability she had been showing during the practice of her jumps. She had tried to convince Eteri to allow her to backload her jumps to catch up to Alina, but she had the last word & she told her that as long as she wasn\u2019t having clean landings, she would continue doing three of her jumps before the second half. She also took out the triple lutz, triple loop combination she had been practicing for her program, which meant that just in technical, she was already several points behind Alina. It seemed like only a miracle could help her retain the title. She took a deep breath & started her routine backstage, practicing her jumps while Exo played in her ipod. This felt like a chronicle of a death foretold, she knew the scores even before she stepped on the ice, she never felt as defeated as today. She saw the girls on her group practicing as she did, Satoko (Miyahara) warmed up flexing her legs while Kaetlyn (Osmond) ran from one corner of the room to the other & Alina practiced her spins in the floor. They all looked focus & ready, while she felt more lost than ever, she tried to put on a brave face but she knew what she was going to be facing, after all she had been seeing Alina\u2019s routine for the last three weeks, while practicing next to her for the World\u2019s Championship. \\- \u201cWhat is the mark of a true champion?\u201d, she remembered the question that Tatyana Tarasova asked her the first time she became a World Champion. That time she answered, \u201cthe way they deal with success\u201d, but Tatyana simply said \u201cNo, my girl. It\u2019s how they face adversity\u201d. Now, she finally understood the depth of her words. Because for two years, she only knew success & maybe during that time she wasn\u2019t a true champion, because her biggest competition was herself. But now, she wasn\u2019t the one leading the group, instead she was the one that had to catch up. And she knew she only had two options, either fight with all her might or settle & be one of the many, another Russian name that would get lost in obscurity after being replaced by a younger skater. Alina would take her place and then someone younger than Alina would come & the cycle would continue. But she refused to be another disposable name in history, she refused to accept her sacrifices meant nothing to her future, she didn\u2019t want her dream to end when it hadn\u2019t even started. So when she heard one of the officials of the event announce to them that they were going to be next on the presentation of the short program, she knew she had to make a choice. And while all the girls started to put on their skates to get ready to hit the ice, she started thinking about the possibilities of the risky decision that she was about to take. And when she finished tying her laces, she held her moon necklace for strength because she knew she had reached one of the most difficult decisions of her life. \t6. Day 30    The season was over for her, \u201cit couldn\u2019t have ended in a worst note\u201d, she thought while she walked Jerry to the park. Summer was near & while she usually looked forward to practice fun routines for the summer shows & catch up with all the animes she missed during the season, this summer felt drearier than ever. For the first time in two years she had missed the podium, she couldn\u2019t even get bronze & this was her own fault. \u201cI knew it was going to be risky\u201d she said to herself. Her last-minute decision to backload all of her jumps didn\u2019t pay off, her foot was still recovering & her stamina didn\u2019t match Alina\u2019s so she fell in her triple Salchow triple toe loop combination. She also got lower GOEs than usual on her jumps, because her landings kept getting sloppier & to top it all, Eteri was mad at her. She didn\u2019t like her decision of changing her program content without consulting her & even when she managed to make it up in the free program following their original script, it wasn\u2019t enough & she ended up being fourth. She knew she was in trouble when Eteri didn\u2019t sat with her at the Kiss & Cry when her results were shown. And she was paying it now, because Eteri had demoted her to train under Sergei (Dudakov), who worked as her right hand on the Training Center. Eteri only managed the top students, so at the moment her main focus was Alina, while she had to raise to the ranks again if she wanted to be considered. Not that it matter, because her last checkup with her doctor shown that she couldn\u2019t train for a month. Her foot was still recovering & all the competitions she had been participating lately, delayed her rehabilitation process. So, she had to sit for the rest of the season & concentrate in getting better, at least that\u2019s what the doctor said. But could she afford to sit & recover? Because that tactic wasn\u2019t working for Adelina (Sotnikova), who was rumored to be retiring soon. Yulia (Lipnitskaya) had already retired & she seemed to be going into coaching. \u201cBut at least they got gold\u201d, her doubts murmured in her head. What did she have? She was just a fading star, one that was dying before she actually had the opportunity to shine. A sudden vibration took her out of her thoughts as she saw a new message on her phone. It was from Misha, since the World Championship ended, Yuzuru, Misha & Wakaba had been her main support, sending her funny messages so she could cheer up. Today, it was a Ryan Gosling meme that said \u201chey girl, the only thing more marvelous than my abs is your smile\u201d. She smiled at his silly joke & only wrote on the group chat she had with her boys   -\u201cHow do you always know how to cheer me up Misha?\u201d   He only answered with another meme, this time it was an image of Yuzuru shirtless with the words   -\u201cHey girl, keep that smile on, or I\u2019ll put my shirt back on\u201d   She laughed this time, and before she could answer she saw that Yuzuru was writing something too   -\u201cYou guys know that I can read everything you write, right?\u201d   Misha wrote back   -\u201cLook at the bright side, your shirtless picture made Janny laugh. Now the question is, if she\u2019s laughing because she\u2019s not impressed by your abs, or because my joke was that funny\u201d   Evgenia joined the banter by writing   -\u201cCouldn\u2019t it be the two options?\u201d   Misha continued   -\u201cDon\u2019t be mean to Yuzu, Janny. Remember that he has an army of fans that can hunt you down\u201d   Evgenia simply answered   -\u201cI know, I\u2019m always afraid I would be attacked by a group of girls holding Pooh bears\u201d   Misha quickly wrote   -\u201cThat\u2019s the nightmare of every girl that interacts with Yuzu for more than 10 seconds\u201d   Yuzuru joined their game & he simply put   \u201cDon\u2019t worry Zhenya, you know that as a Sailor Soldier your powers would prevent the attack of any Pooh bear in your vicinity. And if all you needed to cheer up was a picture of abs, here is a picture of me & Misha shirtless\u201d   When Evgenia saw the picture, she couldn\u2019t stop laughing, because for once Yuzu wasn\u2019t the bottom of the jokes & he finally paid back Misha\u2019s constant teasing. While she wiped the laughing tears from her eyes, she realized that this was the reason she would never regret getting into figure skating. Regardless of her results, what she would take with her wasn\u2019t only the memories of her triumphs, but also the friends she made thanks to this profession. With that thought on her mind, she set up to make a meme of her own to make her boys smile, at that moment she felt that sense of happiness for being able to enjoy the little things in life, she felt the smell of the beginning of summer reaching her & bringing her hope that maybe her journey wasn\u2019t over. And if it was, what a ride it was. \t7. Day 50    Getting back on the ice after sustaining a long-term injury was never easy. It had been almost a month since she last came to train & from her last check-up things seemed better with her foot. Of course, the doctor said to avoid doing triples at least for two more weeks, but she could return to the ice to do some step sequences. Sergei watched her from a corner following her every move & checking her speed to review her motions later on. Before she stepped on the ice, they had discussed what type of music she was thinking for the new season. During her time away from the rink, that\u2019s all she was thinking, what she could do to restore her position and what type of music would suit her comeback. She had settle on \u201cCoppelia: Act I \u2013 Valse\u201d for her free skate program & \u201cPulcinella suite: VIIIb. Finale. Allegro assai\u201d for her short program. Sergei seemed satisfied with her choices & he told her she would need extra training this summer to be able to backload her jumps as she wanted. She was happy with those news, because it meant she was going to be able to face Alina in the same conditions, but it also meant she would have to train extra hard to be able to have enough stamina to keep all of her jumps at the end of her program. When she finished her practice, Sergei pointed out that she was still a little bit stiff on the ice, but that was normal considering she had stopped training for several weeks. He also told her about some of the offers she had for the summer shows, including Dreams on Ice in Japan again",
    "Agent (2024-08-19 15:22:04.727484): I'm still here, listening. Feel free to continue whenever you're ready!",
    "Test (2024-08-19 15:22:04.835971): 3rd and last page:\n\nShe immediately wrote to Yuzuru & Misha who also confirmed they were thinking about it, so she was planning to accept. She already had a song on mind for that show, it was a song she wanted to use for one of her competition programs, but she wouldn\u2019t be able to use it because she had to use ballet songs if she wanted to compete with Alina, because those songs suited better the programs when there was backloading involved. As she left the gym she saw Alina arriving to the Training Center. Now that it was the beginning of summer & she was working with Sergei, she didn\u2019t see Alina as often as before, because they weren\u2019t working together anymore. She waved to Alina from a distance who waved back, but continued her way into the gym without stopping, she knew why. Eteri didn\u2019t like when her students were late & she knew how harder trainings got when she was in a bad mood, so she didn\u2019t blame her. Today, her mom didn\u2019t pick her up from training because she was busy with some errands, and she was planning to ask her to stop bringing her to the gym in the mornings as well. During her time away from the rink she had started to think about asking her mom to keep her distance from her training, maybe if she stopped getting involved with her figure skating, they could have a more normal mother/ daughter relationship, because right now she felt more like a second coach than a mother. The problem is that she didn\u2019t know how to bring the topic to conversation without hurting her mom\u2019s feelings, she knew that making her successful in figure skating had become their joined goal, but right now at her lowest, she didn\u2019t need someone else pushing her harder to get back on shape, she just needed unconditional support, in other words she needed her mom. While waiting to take the subway back home, she saw a guy wearing the best shirt she ever saw & at that moment she wished Yuzuru was with her because he would be the only one else who could understand the joke. But they lived in opposites sides of the world, so she settled for sharing her discovery with him. Carefully she took her cellphone out of her bag & while pretending to write a message, she subtly took a picture of the shirt of the guy, and smiled to herself while she admired the treasure she found. After zooming the picture and checking that the numbers on the shirt were clear, she sent a message to the group chat she had with Yuzuru & Misha. She couldn\u2019t wait for Yuzu to see the picture & maybe give back to him a little bit of the happiness he gave her while he was trying to cheer her up. At that moment the train stopped on the station & she went inside while putting on her headphones, because today \u201cUnravel\u201d would be the soundtrack that would guide her way back home.",

Day 64    Training started as it always did for her for the past two weeks, joining a group of skaters as they followed Tracy (Wilson) on the ice. Among that group she recognized familiar faces that were becoming frequent in the new routine that her life was taking. She could see Gabby trailing behind her, while her brother Zachary adopted a more serious mood on the ice and was fully concentrated on imitating the movements of Tracy along his partner Alison (Schumacher). Cha (Jun-Hwan) stayed closer to Tracy as she explained in a calm manner how every movement they did built agility, balance, coordination & speed. \u201cRemember to listen to your own blade, and follow the sound as the guideline for your movement, forget about how you look & just feel it\u201d, was the instruction that Tracy imparted as they all continued to do the exercises she guided.",

She was happy things were finally looking up, and to top it all she was finally going to be able to work on some choreographies for the summer shows. She already told Daniil (Gleichengauz) she was planning to use \u201cDark Paradise\u201d from Lana del Rey for the two summer shows she confirmed.",

And she knew she was going to miss this kind of training environment, the camaraderie, the laughs, these weren\u2019t things she could get in Russia because everyday it was a competition, everyday it felt like she was part of a battle where only the fittest girls could survive. They had just finished the choreography for the \u201cDreams on Ice\u201d show & while Misha went to change she stayed on the ice practicing by herself. It was rare to have a solo session on the ice, at Eteri\u2019s gym she had to share it with Alina & Polina (Tsurskaya), that\u2019s without counting all the juniors that worked out on that Training Center as well. When she first became a skater, she was in the same position as those girls, looking up to the seniors, dreaming of being on their shoes.",

After all, most of her morning consisted in interviews with different members of Japanese media to talk about the show \u201cDreams on Ice\u201d. And while a part of her appreciated the distraction, because keeping herself busy allowed her to push the problems she wasn\u2019t ready to face under the carpet, she couldn\u2019t help but dread that her last hours in Japan had to be giving interviews instead of spending time with her friends. After all this was going to be the last time she stood on the same ice as Misha, unless he continued doing exhibitions as he had hinted. She wasn\u2019t going to see Wakaba again either until the season started & Ekaterina (Bobrova) one of her few Russian friends was debating her retirement to fulfill her longtime dream of becoming a mother.",

    "Test (2024-08-19 15:21:53.799938): 1st page:\n\n\t1. Day 1    The medal felt heavy on her neck, but the weight of the situation she found herself in weighted more. She tried to smile looking at her training partner on her side, Alina was wearing the gold medal, she had been wearing the gold medal in every competition the last couple of months & although she wanted to be happy for her, she couldn\u2019t help but think in how this would affect her future. Just in their training team with Eteri they had two young girls doing quads, she couldn\u2019t even perfect the triple lutz, how she was going to manage to get to that level in the years to come. \u201cSilver medal is a big achievement\u201d, she tried to tell herself, but the truth is that it felt like a death sentence. It felt like the ending of an unsatisfying journey, she knew the reality of her country in her field, everyday there was a new girl, training as hard as her, younger & better than her. She felt like an used car just waiting to be discarded. An old model who knew her time was up. She had been dedicating her whole life to a sport just to lose it in a matter of minutes, she wanted to be hopeful, to have faith in herself but her last year as a senior was taking a toll on her. She was not only physically exhausted, but also mentally and emotionally tired, \u201cand the season hasn\u2019t even ended yet\u201d, she reminded herself. She still had the Worlds to focus on & she wasn\u2019t sure she could beat Alina there, she wasn\u2019t sure if she would be able to beat her ever again, that\u2019s how crushed she felt. While the anthem of the Olympics played, she saw Eteri from a distance looking at her & Alina, she had a calm expression on her face, saving her thoughts to herself about their results. Eteri had been her coach since she was 6 & although she was friends with her mom & a mentor to her, she never played favourites, she had to earn her respect with every training & every performance. But she knew that now that she lost 2 competitions in a row to Alina, things weren\u2019t looking good for her, especially because soon her competition was going to be tougher with Anna (Scherbakova) & Alexandra (Trusova) close to making their senior debuts. After the medal ceremony ended at Pyeong Chang, Evgenia returned quickly to Eteri\u2019s side while Alina walked slowly behind her. They had to start getting ready for the gala, if she was honest with herself, she didn\u2019t want to participate, she just wanted to be alone, maybe put some ice on her foot that was still not completely healed. She wished she could sleep until the end of the season, if she won gold she could afford to miss the Worlds, but she didn\u2019t, so she had to work hard to maintain herself relevant. But would it be worth it? In two to three years she would have to compete with little girls who could do quads in their sleep. The future look depressing whenever she thought about it. While returning to their hotel to change for practices, Evgenia put on her headphones to avoid interacting with anyone, both Alina & Eteri had been quiet after the ceremony, but that wasn\u2019t rare, Alina was a quiet girl by nature & Eteri wasn\u2019t that talkative either, only during practice she was blunt, after that she only talked when necessary. Normally, she would take on the job of filling the silence, but today she didn\u2019t want to talk, she just wanted to sulk & listen to some music. So she got lost in the music of EXO & closed her eyes. Two hours later they were at the rink, getting ready to practice their exhibition numbers, Evgenia was getting ready to hit the ice when Eteri stopped her. -\u201cAlina is going first today\u201d, she said softly but sternly. Evgenia looked at her atonished before asking why. Eteri simply said, \u201cyou know why\u201d, before walking to Alina\u2019s side to give her some instructions. Evgenia waited outside the rink while Alina worked with Eteri on her \u201cAfro Blue\u201d exhibition number, but she wasn\u2019t looking at Alina, instead she was going through the steps of her program on her mind, remembering each step, trying to analyze how to make her program more complex so it could be more competitive. This was her life, one competition at a time, a whole life dedicated to a sport so it could be reduced to 4 minutes of the world watching & judging. When it was her turn & she stepped to the ice, she closed her eyes to get ready for the same program she had at the exhibitions of the European Championships, it was going to be \u201cKukushka\u201d, the song that represented her journey, the song that represented how she felt at that moment. She tried to put everything behind her, \u201cdon\u2019t look back\u201d she said to herself, she opened her eyes & started everything again. \t2. Day 2    When she opened her eyes, she knew she didn\u2019t felt ready for a new day, the day before it had been the medal ceremony & also her first day of practice for the Exhibition Gala of the Olympics. She practiced with all her heart, she jumped until her legs felt numb because she wanted to tire her body, she wanted to feel tired enough to quiet the doubts of her mind, so she could sleep in peace, so she didn\u2019t fear the uncertainty of her future. The alarm of her cellphone went off at that second reminding her she only had 30 minutes to get ready. They had to leave in one hour to the main rink at Gangneung to practice with the rest of the athletes for their group number at the Gala. This put a smile on her face, she was going to see Misha & Yuzuru there, it still broke her heart that Wakaba wasn\u2019t able to make it to the Olympics, she could have used one of her hugs right now. Checking the clock on her cellphone she realized she lost too much time lost in her thoughts, so she quickly left her bed to start her day. Two hours later she couldn\u2019t stop smiling watching everyone enjoying the practice for the Gala. Everyone at the rink was in a good mood, no one thought about what was going to happen in their futures after the Olympics, they stopped thinking about their falls & mistakes, about the ones who would retire after the Gala, at that moment they were all kids at the playground & that playground was the ice. Just like her, everyone at the rink had dedicated their lives to this sport, to this dream & at that moment she felt ashamed of herself, for not feeling it was enough. Just being here it was a dream, how many girls wanted to be in her position, Wakaba herself couldn\u2019t get a spot on her team, so what if she didn\u2019t win gold, she gave her all. \u201cBut my all wasn\u2019t enough\u201d whispered the doubts on her mind. Today it wasn\u2019t about thinking about her failures, today she was going to enjoy the moment, so she put a smile on her face, the same smile that didn\u2019t reach her heart, but it didn\u2019t matter, because even if she felt empty inside, she was going to enjoy this day, she was going to create memories she would treasure for the rest of her life. -\u201cDo you want to do a jump competition?\u201d asked a playful voice next to her, distracting her from her thoughts. She turned her head to see Misha smiling at her & she laughed before joining his playful mood to say   \\- \u201cI don\u2019t know, I don\u2019t want you to get hurt, we all know joints start to ache at 26\u201d. He laughed before continuing their game   \\- \u201cAre you calling me old Medvedeva\u201d. She put on her best poker face before saying   -\u201cSo it\u2019s not only your joints that hurt, you\u2019re also bad at hearing, I feel so sorry for you Misha\u201d. Immediately after saying that, she felt his hands on her hips & she felt her weight leaving the ice before she realized Misha was carrying her & laughing loudly. -\u201cPut me down Misha\u201d she said a little bit scared. \\- \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I had a big breakfast, so I\u2019m still strong\u201d he said with a smile. -\u201cAre you guys going to try pair figure skating now?\u201d asked a voice next to them, that belonged to the Yuzuru Hanyu, someone Evgenia still couldn\u2019t believe she was able to call a friend. -\u201cWhy, are you jealous?\u201d asked Misha, \u201cdon\u2019t believe I forgot how Ondrej (Hotarek) carried you yesterday\u201d, he said joking, while carefully putting Evgenia back on the ice. \\- \u201cOndrej carried this kid?\u201d asked Zhenya with a smile. -\u201cEverybody wants to carry me because I\u2019m cute\u201d joked Yuzuru. \\- \u201cI always knew that Ondrej was one of your fangirls\u201d teased Evgenia. \\- \u201cMaybe he would get you a new Pooh bear\u201d said Misha, joining Evgenia on her teasing. Yuzuru just laughed as he always did & Evgenia couldn\u2019t help but think how lucky she was to be able to share this kind of moments with them. \u201cTreasure this moments because they are not going to last\u201d, said the treacherous voice on her head, but she refused to listen, not today, she said to herself. \u201cToday my fears are not going to take over\u201d, she repeated as a mantra on her mind. So to quiet her doubts, she skated close to Yuzuru & Misha and asked \u201cso, are you ready for this jump competition?\u201d. \t3. Day 3    The night of the Gala felt like a pause on her life. Like time had stop over to give her a break. She walked around backstage excited of seeing everyone while they got ready. It was strange to not feel nerves, but tonight it wasn\u2019t a competition, tonight it was about enjoying the ice. Performing was what she had done through her whole life, bringing joy to people through her hardwork it was an indescribable feeling, a feeling she didn\u2019t want to give up. -\u201cYou look happy\u201d said a voice behind her. She turned & saw Yuzuru looking at her. He had a smile on his face, because Yuzuru without a smile wasn\u2019t the Yuzuru she knew. -\u201cI\u2019m happy to see everyone happy\u201d she said a little bit shyly, she always felt timid when she was alone with Yuzuru, it was easier when Misha was around, but being alone with him made her nervous. -\u201cI like your outfit\u201d he said, before picking her hood & putting it on her head. \\- \u201cWe can exchange outfits if you want\u201d she said smiling while putting her hood back in its place, \u201cI\u2019m sure the feathers would suit me better than you\u201d. \\- \u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d he answered, \u201cno one is as badass as you\u201d. Evgenia stayed silent because she didn\u2019t know how to answer. It was easy to go for the joke, but when he was earnest, he destroyed all of her walls. -\u201cI wanted to congratulate you\u201d he said softly, taking a step closer to her. \\- \u201cFor what\u201d she asked quietly. \\- \u201cGetting silver of course\u201d he said gently & she felt the understanding on his voice. -\u201cThank you\u201d she said while looking at the floor \u201cbut you\u2019re the one that should get all the praises, two golds is not a small feature Yuzuru\u201d. -\u201cYou don\u2019t have to pretend\u201d he said in a whisper & she felt the air leaving her lungs as if someone had punched her. \u201cI know it\u2019s hard, what you did that day, it\u2019s worth more than a medal, you\u2019re a champion Zhenya, never forget it\u201d he said carefully. She looked up not caring anymore he would see the tears in her eyes & she saw the surprise on his face when she went for a hug. -\u201cI\u2019m sorry\u201d she said softly in his arms, she tried to let go because she had acted on impulse, but she felt him hugging her even tighter. \\- \u201cDon\u2019t apologize, we all need a hug sometimes\u201d he told her gently finally letting go. -\u201cI know those hugs are exclusive for Pooh-san\u201d she joked while wiping the tears from her eyes. -\u201cHe told me he can share the hugs with you & with Luna-chan\u201d he told her in a voice that warmed her heart, she was no match for him, her heart ran wild & beat harder than ever, so she said in a whisper \u201cI think I\u2019m ok with that\u201d. During the rest of the evening she could feel the eyes of Yuzuru following her at times, she knew she surprised him with the hug. They have hugged before but this was different because this time it felt like he was consoling her, so it felt more intimate. She tried to calm herself as she always did, with skating, she started going back on the steps for her program on her mind, she repeated the choreography on loop on her memory while listening to Kukushka on her ipod. She usually listened to Exo before the competitions but tonight she wasn\u2019t competing, she wasn\u2019t even performing, because she wasn\u2019t planning to portray anyone but herself through her program, she was going to express something she couldn\u2019t put into words, something she felt in her heart. This is what skating was for her, not only the sport that she dedicated her life to, but also the place where she could be herself. Even when she played a character there was always a little bit of herself in every show, in every step, in every turn & in every jump. Tonight, her heart was going to stay on the ice. She stayed close to the rink when Gabriella & Guillaume took the ice. She had been watching everyone\u2019s program, from Javier\u2019s fun \u201cAerobic class\u201d to the romantic performance of Han & Sui with \u201cRun\u201d. She wanted to take it all, because this moment with everyone relaxing & smiling was rare, in less than a month they had to be in Milan for the World Championships & she wasn\u2019t looking forward to it. This would be the last day to relax before she started training for her next competition. That had been her routine for the last four years, competitions during the winter & fall seasons and shows & training through the summer. Time passed by, people changed but ice was always there, as a permanent feature on her life. As she saw Gabriella & Guillaume finish their performance to \u201cPray you catch me\u201d she got ready to be next. It was always difficult to get back to perform for an audience after a disappointing result in competition, especially when it was an exhibition that relied more in engaging the audience than just concentrating in the technical side of her program. Luckily, she didn\u2019t have to smile or be flirty for \u201cKukushka\u201d, the dark themes of the song suited the state of her soul at the moment, so it was easy to get lost in the tempo of the song. She skated slowly to the center of the rink after Gabriella & Guillaume left the ice, she could see the flashes, hear the announcer calling her name, she could feel the eyes of every person in the arena, but at that moment she erased them all. This was not a performance for them, this was for herself. To remind herself why she still dedicated her life to this profession, why even after the biggest disappointment in her life she couldn\u2019t imagine doing anything else but going back to what she knew. This was who she is & this was what she wanted to continue doing for as long as she could. She closed her eyes & when she heard the first notes of the song, she felt ready to tell a story through her art again. \t4. Day 15    She could feel every muscle in her body ache at the end of her practice, she had one more week to train before the World Figure Skating Championship started & her goal of revalidating her gold medal there seemed to be more far away than ever",
    "Agent (2024-08-19 15:21:57.920128): I'm here, listening. Please continue whenever you're ready!",
    "Test (2024-08-19 15:21:57.973176): 2nd page:\n\n-\u201cEvgenia\u201d, she heard the voice of Eteri calling her. She skated slowly to the end of the rink where she was standing to hear the reviews of her training. -\u201cYour landings are off\u201d she said severely, \u201cif you don\u2019t have secure landings, you cannot do the combinations\u201d, she reminded her. \u201cYou need to stay later tomorrow to practice if you want to catch up to Alina\u201d, she said sternly before turning & walking down to her office. This was common with Eteri, always pointing down the mistakes, but never praising her skaters when things went well, she should be used by now, but sometimes she wished she could get a word of encouragement. She turned to the ice & saw Alina leaving the rink quietly. -\u201cAre you alright?\u201d asked Alina as soon as she reached her. -\u201cYes, thank you. I\u2019m just tired\u201d, answered Zhenya before walking to the dressing rooms to pick her things so she could go home. As she left the gym, she saw her mom\u2019s car in the parking lot. She always made time to take her to trainings & pick her up everyday, that\u2019s why she felt she had no right to complain. Her mom had already sacrificed enough to make her dreams come true, so the least she could do is to deliver in what has become the dream of both of them. -\u201dHey honey, how was practice?\u201d, her mom asked as soon as she got in the car. -\u201cIt was good, I feel I\u2019m improving\u201d she said without looking at her mom in the eyes while pretending to be busy with her phone. That was a bad habit she had, everytime she felt she couldn\u2019t be honest, she looked at the floor or anywhere else to avoid the eyes of the person she couldn't be sincere to. Wakaba once told her that the expressiveness of her face was her biggest curse but also her biggest weapon. On the ice it was a great help when she needed to portray a character, but on real life it presented a problem because it meant anyone could read her like a book. -\u201cEteri called me this morning\u201d said her mom, taking her out of her thoughts. -\u201cWhy?\u201d, she asked softly, fearing her answer   -\u201cShe told me you are having problems with your landings & she\u2019s worried\u201d, she told her while starting the car   Evgenia didn\u2019t answer, didn\u2019t confirm her mom\u2019s suspicions because if she vocalized her fears, she knew she would crumble, so she stayed silent until her mom spoke again. -\u201cEteri said that there are only two reasons this could be happening & let\u2019s hope it\u2019s not the worst case scenario\u201d she told her in a tone that worried her   -\u201cwhat is the worst case scenario?\u201d, she asked with fear   -\u201cSkaters start to lose precision & flexibility with age, you\u2019re getting older so it\u2019s normal you cannot jump as easily as other skaters younger than you, the problem is that this would mean you already reached your peak\u201d she said in a straight tone. When her mom put the facts so bluntly she really hated to be the daughter of a former figure skater, if her mom had been just a housewife like Alina\u2019s grandmother maybe she could be more supportive. But that wasn\u2019t the nature of her mom, she always went straight to the point, which might be the reason why she was close with Eteri, they were both painfully frank. -\u201cwhat is the best case scenario?\u201d she asked hopefully   -\u201cthat you might be injured\u201d she answered candidly. Evgenia felt the tears in her eyes, but held it together & simply said   -\u201cthen let\u2019s hope for the best case scenario\u201d before putting on her headphones on & staying silent until they reached home. As soon as she reached the apartment she shared with her mom, she took her shoes off & started walking to her bedroom but the voice of her mother made her stop   -\u201cYou don\u2019t want dinner?\u201d her mom asked while closing the door of their home. -\u201cYou know I can\u2019t eat after 6, least of all so close to competition\u201d, she answered dryly before continuing her way to her bedroom. As soon as she arrived to her destination, she saw a small package on her bed & while picking up the small gift she saw a simple note that said \u201cTo Zhenya-chan\u201d. When she opened carefully the wrapping paper she saw that inside there was a cute necklace of a moon & next to it a note that said   \u201cThis is your belated Olympic gift, you\u2019re always gold in our hearts, gambatte Zhenya-chan! With love   M & Y\u201d   She smiled to herself & immediately reached for her phone to write to her boys. When the world looked bleak they always put a smile on her face, this was a reminder of what she held dear, after this there was only one way, she was going to fight for a chance. \t5. Day 24    It was loud on the arena, louder than any normal competition, because this wasn\u2019t any normal competition, this was the World\u2019s Championship. After the Olympics, this was the biggest accomplishment any athlete on her field could get. She had already won it twice & she should be relaxed at this stage by now, but this year, after everything than unraveled, this felt like a test. Is this the end of Evgenia Medvedeva? That\u2019s the question everyone in the media was asking. If she lost, it not only reinforced the idea that Alina had come to take her place, but also it would erase what she accomplished, she would be another story to add to the older figure skater losing her place to someone younger narrative. Maybe Eteri was right & she already reached her peak before the Olympics. For two years, she was on the top of her field, but not anymore & although she was still in the podium she knew it was just a matter of time until one of the juniors of her country became a senior & started making things more complicated for her with quads. She made sure to avoid the media while getting ready for the World\u2019s, she didn\u2019t want anything to distract her from her training, but everyday Eteri informed her of new requests for interviews with Alina. The media was enjoying their rivalry & with Yuzuru not participating at the World Championship, the media made sure to hype the battle of the Russian Ladies as much as they could. But that wasn\u2019t what worried her, but the lack of stability she had been showing during the practice of her jumps. She had tried to convince Eteri to allow her to backload her jumps to catch up to Alina, but she had the last word & she told her that as long as she wasn\u2019t having clean landings, she would continue doing three of her jumps before the second half. She also took out the triple lutz, triple loop combination she had been practicing for her program, which meant that just in technical, she was already several points behind Alina. It seemed like only a miracle could help her retain the title. She took a deep breath & started her routine backstage, practicing her jumps while Exo played in her ipod. This felt like a chronicle of a death foretold, she knew the scores even before she stepped on the ice, she never felt as defeated as today. She saw the girls on her group practicing as she did, Satoko (Miyahara) warmed up flexing her legs while Kaetlyn (Osmond) ran from one corner of the room to the other & Alina practiced her spins in the floor. They all looked focus & ready, while she felt more lost than ever, she tried to put on a brave face but she knew what she was going to be facing, after all she had been seeing Alina\u2019s routine for the last three weeks, while practicing next to her for the World\u2019s Championship. \\- \u201cWhat is the mark of a true champion?\u201d, she remembered the question that Tatyana Tarasova asked her the first time she became a World Champion. That time she answered, \u201cthe way they deal with success\u201d, but Tatyana simply said \u201cNo, my girl. It\u2019s how they face adversity\u201d. Now, she finally understood the depth of her words. Because for two years, she only knew success & maybe during that time she wasn\u2019t a true champion, because her biggest competition was herself. But now, she wasn\u2019t the one leading the group, instead she was the one that had to catch up. And she knew she only had two options, either fight with all her might or settle & be one of the many, another Russian name that would get lost in obscurity after being replaced by a younger skater. Alina would take her place and then someone younger than Alina would come & the cycle would continue. But she refused to be another disposable name in history, she refused to accept her sacrifices meant nothing to her future, she didn\u2019t want her dream to end when it hadn\u2019t even started. So when she heard one of the officials of the event announce to them that they were going to be next on the presentation of the short program, she knew she had to make a choice. And while all the girls started to put on their skates to get ready to hit the ice, she started thinking about the possibilities of the risky decision that she was about to take. And when she finished tying her laces, she held her moon necklace for strength because she knew she had reached one of the most difficult decisions of her life. \t6. Day 30    The season was over for her, \u201cit couldn\u2019t have ended in a worst note\u201d, she thought while she walked Jerry to the park. Summer was near & while she usually looked forward to practice fun routines for the summer shows & catch up with all the animes she missed during the season, this summer felt drearier than ever. For the first time in two years she had missed the podium, she couldn\u2019t even get bronze & this was her own fault. \u201cI knew it was going to be risky\u201d she said to herself. Her last-minute decision to backload all of her jumps didn\u2019t pay off, her foot was still recovering & her stamina didn\u2019t match Alina\u2019s so she fell in her triple Salchow triple toe loop combination. She also got lower GOEs than usual on her jumps, because her landings kept getting sloppier & to top it all, Eteri was mad at her. She didn\u2019t like her decision of changing her program content without consulting her & even when she managed to make it up in the free program following their original script, it wasn\u2019t enough & she ended up being fourth. She knew she was in trouble when Eteri didn\u2019t sat with her at the Kiss & Cry when her results were shown. And she was paying it now, because Eteri had demoted her to train under Sergei (Dudakov), who worked as her right hand on the Training Center. Eteri only managed the top students, so at the moment her main focus was Alina, while she had to raise to the ranks again if she wanted to be considered. Not that it matter, because her last checkup with her doctor shown that she couldn\u2019t train for a month. Her foot was still recovering & all the competitions she had been participating lately, delayed her rehabilitation process. So, she had to sit for the rest of the season & concentrate in getting better, at least that\u2019s what the doctor said. But could she afford to sit & recover? Because that tactic wasn\u2019t working for Adelina (Sotnikova), who was rumored to be retiring soon. Yulia (Lipnitskaya) had already retired & she seemed to be going into coaching. \u201cBut at least they got gold\u201d, her doubts murmured in her head. What did she have? She was just a fading star, one that was dying before she actually had the opportunity to shine. A sudden vibration took her out of her thoughts as she saw a new message on her phone. It was from Misha, since the World Championship ended, Yuzuru, Misha & Wakaba had been her main support, sending her funny messages so she could cheer up. Today, it was a Ryan Gosling meme that said \u201chey girl, the only thing more marvelous than my abs is your smile\u201d. She smiled at his silly joke & only wrote on the group chat she had with her boys   -\u201cHow do you always know how to cheer me up Misha?\u201d   He only answered with another meme, this time it was an image of Yuzuru shirtless with the words   -\u201cHey girl, keep that smile on, or I\u2019ll put my shirt back on\u201d   She laughed this time, and before she could answer she saw that Yuzuru was writing something too   -\u201cYou guys know that I can read everything you write, right?\u201d   Misha wrote back   -\u201cLook at the bright side, your shirtless picture made Janny laugh. Now the question is, if she\u2019s laughing because she\u2019s not impressed by your abs, or because my joke was that funny\u201d   Evgenia joined the banter by writing   -\u201cCouldn\u2019t it be the two options?\u201d   Misha continued   -\u201cDon\u2019t be mean to Yuzu, Janny. Remember that he has an army of fans that can hunt you down\u201d   Evgenia simply answered   -\u201cI know, I\u2019m always afraid I would be attacked by a group of girls holding Pooh bears\u201d   Misha quickly wrote   -\u201cThat\u2019s the nightmare of every girl that interacts with Yuzu for more than 10 seconds\u201d   Yuzuru joined their game & he simply put   \u201cDon\u2019t worry Zhenya, you know that as a Sailor Soldier your powers would prevent the attack of any Pooh bear in your vicinity. And if all you needed to cheer up was a picture of abs, here is a picture of me & Misha shirtless\u201d   When Evgenia saw the picture, she couldn\u2019t stop laughing, because for once Yuzu wasn\u2019t the bottom of the jokes & he finally paid back Misha\u2019s constant teasing. While she wiped the laughing tears from her eyes, she realized that this was the reason she would never regret getting into figure skating. Regardless of her results, what she would take with her wasn\u2019t only the memories of her triumphs, but also the friends she made thanks to this profession. With that thought on her mind, she set up to make a meme of her own to make her boys smile, at that moment she felt that sense of happiness for being able to enjoy the little things in life, she felt the smell of the beginning of summer reaching her & bringing her hope that maybe her journey wasn\u2019t over. And if it was, what a ride it was. \t7. Day 50    Getting back on the ice after sustaining a long-term injury was never easy. It had been almost a month since she last came to train & from her last check-up things seemed better with her foot. Of course, the doctor said to avoid doing triples at least for two more weeks, but she could return to the ice to do some step sequences. Sergei watched her from a corner following her every move & checking her speed to review her motions later on. Before she stepped on the ice, they had discussed what type of music she was thinking for the new season. During her time away from the rink, that\u2019s all she was thinking, what she could do to restore her position and what type of music would suit her comeback. She had settle on \u201cCoppelia: Act I \u2013 Valse\u201d for her free skate program & \u201cPulcinella suite: VIIIb. Finale. Allegro assai\u201d for her short program. Sergei seemed satisfied with her choices & he told her she would need extra training this summer to be able to backload her jumps as she wanted. She was happy with those news, because it meant she was going to be able to face Alina in the same conditions, but it also meant she would have to train extra hard to be able to have enough stamina to keep all of her jumps at the end of her program. When she finished her practice, Sergei pointed out that she was still a little bit stiff on the ice, but that was normal considering she had stopped training for several weeks. He also told her about some of the offers she had for the summer shows, including Dreams on Ice in Japan again",
    "Agent (2024-08-19 15:22:04.727484): I'm still here, listening. Feel free to continue whenever you're ready!",
    "Test (2024-08-19 15:22:04.835971): 3rd and last page:\n\nShe immediately wrote to Yuzuru & Misha who also confirmed they were thinking about it, so she was planning to accept. She already had a song on mind for that show, it was a song she wanted to use for one of her competition programs, but she wouldn\u2019t be able to use it because she had to use ballet songs if she wanted to compete with Alina, because those songs suited better the programs when there was backloading involved. As she left the gym she saw Alina arriving to the Training Center. Now that it was the beginning of summer & she was working with Sergei, she didn\u2019t see Alina as often as before, because they weren\u2019t working together anymore. She waved to Alina from a distance who waved back, but continued her way into the gym without stopping, she knew why. Eteri didn\u2019t like when her students were late & she knew how harder trainings got when she was in a bad mood, so she didn\u2019t blame her. Today, her mom didn\u2019t pick her up from training because she was busy with some errands, and she was planning to ask her to stop bringing her to the gym in the mornings as well. During her time away from the rink she had started to think about asking her mom to keep her distance from her training, maybe if she stopped getting involved with her figure skating, they could have a more normal mother/ daughter relationship, because right now she felt more like a second coach than a mother. The problem is that she didn\u2019t know how to bring the topic to conversation without hurting her mom\u2019s feelings, she knew that making her successful in figure skating had become their joined goal, but right now at her lowest, she didn\u2019t need someone else pushing her harder to get back on shape, she just needed unconditional support, in other words she needed her mom. While waiting to take the subway back home, she saw a guy wearing the best shirt she ever saw & at that moment she wished Yuzuru was with her because he would be the only one else who could understand the joke. But they lived in opposites sides of the world, so she settled for sharing her discovery with him. Carefully she took her cellphone out of her bag & while pretending to write a message, she subtly took a picture of the shirt of the guy, and smiled to herself while she admired the treasure she found. After zooming the picture and checking that the numbers on the shirt were clear, she sent a message to the group chat she had with Yuzuru & Misha. She couldn\u2019t wait for Yuzu to see the picture & maybe give back to him a little bit of the happiness he gave her while he was trying to cheer her up. At that moment the train stopped on the station & she went inside while putting on her headphones, because today \u201cUnravel\u201d would be the soundtrack that would guide her way back home.",

Day 64    Training started as it always did for her for the past two weeks, joining a group of skaters as they followed Tracy (Wilson) on the ice. Among that group she recognized familiar faces that were becoming frequent in the new routine that her life was taking. She could see Gabby trailing behind her, while her brother Zachary adopted a more serious mood on the ice and was fully concentrated on imitating the movements of Tracy along his partner Alison (Schumacher). Cha (Jun-Hwan) stayed closer to Tracy as she explained in a calm manner how every movement they did built agility, balance, coordination & speed. \u201cRemember to listen to your own blade, and follow the sound as the guideline for your movement, forget about how you look & just feel it\u201d, was the instruction that Tracy imparted as they all continued to do the exercises she guided.",

He did recommend she slept with an ice pack on her foot for the next two weeks to finish her treatment & she had to meet him again by the end of the month to confirm her injury had completely healed. She was happy things were finally looking up, and to top it all she was finally going to be able to work on some choreographies for the summer shows. She already told Daniil (Gleichengauz) she was planning to use \u201cDark Paradise\u201d from Lana del Rey for the two summer shows she confirmed.",

And she knew she was going to miss this kind of training environment, the camaraderie, the laughs, these weren\u2019t things she could get in Russia because everyday it was a competition, everyday it felt like she was part of a battle where only the fittest girls could survive. They had just finished the choreography for the \u201cDreams on Ice\u201d show & while Misha went to change she stayed on the ice practicing by herself. It was rare to have a solo session on the ice, at Eteri\u2019s gym she had to share it with Alina & Polina (Tsurskaya), that\u2019s without counting all the juniors that worked out on that Training Center as well. When she first became a skater, she was in the same position as those girls, looking up to the seniors, dreaming of being on their shoes.",

Day 64    As Evgenia made her way to the rink with David following her from behind, she couldn\u2019t help but feel nervous about Yuzuru & Javier watching her practice. So as soon as they reached the ice, she turned to David unsure if she should share her doubts   -\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong\u201d, he asked noticing her hesitant expression. -\u201cMaybe it would be better if you start with Javier after all, because I don\u2019t want to bore them watching my program, when I don\u2019t even have any jumps to show them yet\u201d, she expressed nervously. -\u201cIt\u2019s too late to do that now, Javier already gave you his training turn. Besides I think they would like what we have done so far\u201d, said David in a kind tone trying to give her some reassurance. -\u201cMaybe we can start adding some of the jumps today\u201d, suggested Evgenia. -\u201cHave you finished training your jumps with Ghislain?\u201d, asked David to bolster his point. -\u201cNo, he\u2019s still making me do doubles.",

Day 64    Impatience wasn\u2019t an attribute that she was known for, but that was the feeling that she had through the morning before the show. After all, most of her morning consisted in interviews with different members of Japanese media to talk about the show \u201cDreams on Ice\u201d. And while a part of her appreciated the distraction, because keeping herself busy allowed her to push the problems she wasn\u2019t ready to face under the carpet, she couldn\u2019t help but dread that her last hours in Japan had to be giving interviews instead of spending time with her friends. After all this was going to be the last time she stood on the same ice as Misha, unless he continued doing exhibitions as he had hinted.
