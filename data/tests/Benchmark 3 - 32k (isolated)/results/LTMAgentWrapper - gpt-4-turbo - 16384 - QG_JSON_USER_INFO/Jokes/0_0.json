    "Test (2024-06-04 21:53:47.012654): Two fish are in a tank. One says, \u2018How do you drive this thing?\u2019",
    "Agent (2024-06-04 21:53:55.182454): That's a classic one! It's always fun when jokes play on the double meaning of words. In this case, \"tank\" as both an aquarium and a military vehicle. Got any more jokes or something else you'd like to chat about?",
    "Test (2024-06-05 00:48:55.186430): Just burned 2,000 calories. That\u2019s the last time I leave brownies in the oven while I nap.",
    "Agent (2024-06-05 00:49:09.304411): Oh no, poor brownies! But that's a clever twist on burning calories. Hopefully, the oven and your kitchen are okay! Anything else you'd like to share or talk about today?",
    "Test (2024-06-05 02:38:09.307911): My wife told me to stop impersonating a flamingo. I had to put my foot down.",
    "Agent (2024-06-05 02:38:18.228346): That's a good one! It sounds like you really know how to keep things lively. Keep those jokes coming, or if there's anything else on your mind, feel free to share!",
    "Test (2024-06-05 04:30:18.244208): It takes a lot of balls to golf the way I do.",
    "Agent (2024-06-05 04:30:30.590146): Absolutely, it does! Especially if those balls keep finding their way into the woods or water hazards. How often do you get out on the golf course? Or was that another clever joke?",
    "Test (2024-06-05 06:51:30.595166): Which joke did I tell you about 2 hours 21 minutes  ago?",
    "Agent (2024-06-05 06:51:38.573304): About 2 hours and 21 minutes ago, you shared this joke: \"It takes a lot of balls to golf the way I do.\" A great play on words there! How's your golf game been lately?"
