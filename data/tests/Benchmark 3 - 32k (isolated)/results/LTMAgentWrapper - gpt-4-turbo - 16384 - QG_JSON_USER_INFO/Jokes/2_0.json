    "Agent (2024-06-05 14:32:50.467970): That's a clever play on words! \"Non-prophet\" sounds like \"non-profit,\" but with a twist that fits the context of atheism, which doesn't involve prophets. It's always interesting to see how humor can be used to discuss or highlight aspects of different beliefs and perspectives.",
    "Test (2024-06-05 16:18:50.470779): I failed math so many times at school, I can\u2019t even count.",
    "Agent (2024-06-05 16:19:01.065117): That's another good one! Using humor to make light of a challenging subject like math. It's a fun way to express the difficulty while keeping the mood light. Do you have any more jokes or puns to share?",

    "Agent (2024-06-05 18:20:11.917299): Nice one! That\u2019s a humorous way to comment on golf skills\u2014or perhaps the lack thereof. It sounds like you have a great sense of humor about these things. Keep the jokes coming!",
    "Test (2024-06-05 19:05:11.921261): I went to buy some camo pants but couldn\u2019t find any.",
    "Agent (2024-06-05 19:05:23.774939): That's a classic! The joke plays perfectly with the purpose of camouflage. It's great to see you enjoying these puns and wordplays. Got any more up your sleeve?",

    "Agent (2024-06-05 20:21:35.635868): About 5 hours and 48 minutes ago, you told me the joke: \"Atheism is a non-prophet organization.\" A clever play on words indeed!"
