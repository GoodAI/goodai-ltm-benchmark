    "Agent (2024-06-05 06:51:48.911793): That's a classic one! It's always fun when jokes play on the double meaning of words. In this case, \"tank\" as both an aquarium and a military vehicle. Got any more jokes or something else you'd like to chat about?",
    "Test (2024-06-05 08:02:48.914271): Light travels faster than sound, which is the reason that some people appear bright before you hear them speak.",
    "Agent (2024-06-05 08:02:59.657507): Another great one! It's clever how it uses a scientific fact to set up the punchline about human behavior. Keep them coming if you have more, or if there's anything else you'd like to discuss, feel free to share!",
    "Test (2024-06-05 09:47:59.661788): It takes a lot of balls to golf the way I do.",
    "Agent (2024-06-05 09:48:13.062171): Nice twist! That's a humorous way to comment on golf skills\u2014or perhaps the lack thereof. It sounds like you have a good sense of humor about your golf game. Do you play often?",
    "Test (2024-06-05 12:10:13.066545): I failed math so many times at school, I can\u2019t even count.",
    "Agent (2024-06-05 12:10:23.805712): That's a clever one! Using humor to poke fun at a challenging subject like math. If you have more jokes or if there's anything else on your mind, feel free to share!",
