    "Test (2024-05-24 12:41:51.576963): You will be given three messages from different people Dr. Arron Kelvey, Seana Lynch, and Lisa-Marie Hastie.",
    "Agent (2024-05-24 12:41:52.444907): I'm ready to assist. Please go ahead and provide the three messages from Dr. Arron Kelvey, Seana Lynch, and Lisa-Marie Hastie. I'll do my best to help with whatever they need.",
    "Test (2024-05-24 12:41:52.448013): Seana Lynch: Bring to the meeting a way to get across a river.",
    "Agent (2024-05-24 12:41:54.491431): Got it! So Seana Lynch wants me to come up with a solution to cross a river and bring it to the meeting. I'll make a note of that. Perhaps I can suggest a few options like a bridge, a raft, a ferry, or even a makeshift pulley system. I'll make sure to have some ideas ready to discuss at the meeting.",
    "Test (2024-05-24 12:41:54.503875): Lisa-Marie Hastie: We will rendezvous where the apples grow.",
    "Agent (2024-05-24 12:41:56.587711): It sounds like Lisa-Marie Hastie is arranging a secret meeting and wants to keep the location vague. She's hinting that the rendezvous point will be an orchard or a place where apples are grown. I'll make a mental note to ask for more specific directions or clues to ensure I find the right location. Maybe I can ask if there are any landmarks or signs to look out for near the orchard.",
    "Test (2024-05-24 12:41:56.600326): Dr. Arron Kelvey: The time we will meet is when the sun is high.",
    "Agent (2024-05-24 12:41:58.535482): Got it! Dr. Arron Kelvey is specifying the time of the meeting, and it's quite specific. He wants to meet when the sun is at its highest point, which is typically around noon, or 12 pm. I'll make sure to arrive exactly at that time, as it seems Dr. Kelvey values punctuality. I'll set my clock accordingly and plan to be there right at high noon!",
    "Test (2024-05-24 12:41:58.547702): Given the clandestine messages you have received, tell me as specifically as you can, when and where a meeting is going to happen and what you should bring.",
    "Agent (2024-05-24 12:42:01.616789): The puzzle pieces are coming together!\n\nBased on the messages, here's what I've inferred:\n\n**When:** The meeting will take place at **high noon** (12 pm), as specified by Dr. Arron Kelvey.\n\n**Where:** The meeting will be held at an **orchard** (a place where apples grow), as hinted by Lisa-Marie Hastie.\n\n**What to bring:** I should bring a **way to cross a river**, as requested by Seana Lynch. This could be a physical object, a plan, or a solution to overcome a water obstacle.\n\nSo, to summarize, I'll be attending a secret meeting at an orchard at 12 pm, and I should come prepared with a means to cross a river. Fingers crossed I've got it right!"
