    "Test (2024-05-24 12:37:55.640076): There is a Retail Area in the center of my hometown.",
    "Agent (2024-05-24 12:37:57.508958): That's great! A retail area in the center of your hometown can be a bustling hub of activity, with a variety of shops, restaurants, and services for locals and visitors to enjoy.\n\nWhat would you like to know or discuss about the retail area in your hometown? Are you thinking of visiting it soon and looking for recommendations? Or perhaps you're curious about the history or development of the area? Let me know and I'd be happy to help!",
    "Test (2024-05-24 12:37:57.522915): About 2 km North of the Retail Area there is a Hospital",
    "Agent (2024-05-24 12:37:59.323050): So there's a hospital located about 2 km north of the retail area in your hometown. That's convenient for people who may need to visit the hospital and then grab some essentials or grab a bite to eat afterwards. It's also close enough that hospital staff and visitors can easily access the retail area during their breaks.\n\nIs the hospital a major one in your area, or is it a smaller specialized facility? Are there any other amenities or services near the hospital that cater to its patients and staff, such as pharmacies, medical offices, or food courts?",
    "Test (2024-05-24 12:37:59.335933): Park is a location in my home town, it is 2 KM, South from Hospital.",
    "Agent (2024-05-24 12:38:01.268463): So, there's a park in your hometown, and it's located about 2 km south of the hospital. That's a lovely spot for people to relax and unwind, especially for those who may be visiting loved ones at the hospital or need a break from the hustle and bustle of daily life.\n\nIs the park a popular spot for recreation, with features like walking trails, playgrounds, or sports facilities? Or is it more of a quiet, serene space for contemplation and relaxation? Does it have any notable landmarks, monuments, or events that take place there?",
    "Test (2024-05-24 12:38:01.281578): I visited Library, which is 1 KM, North from Park.",
    "Agent (2024-05-24 12:38:03.624102): You've been to the library, which is conveniently located just 1 km north of the park. That's a great combination - getting some fresh air and exercise at the park, and then heading to the library to indulge in some reading or learning.\n\nIs the library a modern facility with a wide range of books, media, and resources? Do they have any special collections or programs for kids, or is it more of a quiet study space? Did you have a favorite section or book that you like to visit when you're there?",
    "Test (2024-05-24 12:38:03.636846): About 1 km West of the Library there is a High Street",
    "Agent (2024-05-24 12:38:06.808931): So, there's a High Street about 1 km west of the library. That's a great location, as it's likely to be a busy and vibrant area with a mix of shops, cafes, and services.\n\nIs the High Street the main shopping street in your hometown, with a variety of independent boutiques and national chain stores? Are there any particular landmarks or attractions on the High Street, such as a historic town hall, a museum, or a popular restaurant or pub?\n\nAlso, I'm starting to get a sense of the layout of your hometown. If I'm correct, the Retail Area is about 2 km south of the Hospital, the Park is about 2 km south of the Hospital, the Library is about 1 km north of the Park, and the High Street is about 1 km west of the Library. Am I right?",
    "Test (2024-05-24 12:38:06.821168): And finally there is Playground which is East from High Street and 1 KM from it.",
    "Agent (2024-05-24 12:38:09.563236): So, there's a playground located east of the High Street, about 1 km away. That's a great spot for kids to burn off energy and have some fun, and it's conveniently located near the shops and services on the High Street.\n\nI think I've got a good sense of the layout of your hometown now. To recap, we have:\n\n* The Retail Area in the center of town\n* The Hospital, about 2 km north of the Retail Area\n* The Park, about 2 km south of the Hospital\n* The Library, about 1 km north of the Park\n* The High Street, about 1 km west of the Library\n* The Playground, about 1 km east of the High Street\n\nIs that correct?
