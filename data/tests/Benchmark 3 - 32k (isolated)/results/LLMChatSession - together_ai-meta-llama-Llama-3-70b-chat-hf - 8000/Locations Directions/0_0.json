    "Test (2024-05-24 12:37:05.465096): There is a Hospital in the center of my hometown.",
    "Agent (2024-05-24 12:37:07.303804): That's great! Having a hospital in the center of your hometown can be very convenient for residents, especially in emergency situations. It's likely that the hospital provides a range of medical services, including emergency care, surgical services, and outpatient clinics.\n\nDo you have a specific question about the hospital or would you like to know more about its services or facilities? Or perhaps you're looking for directions or contact information? I'm here to help!",
    "Test (2024-05-24 12:37:07.316770): Library is a location in my home town, it is 4 KM, East from Hospital.",
    "Agent (2024-05-24 12:37:09.145949): So, the library is located 4 kilometers east of the hospital in your hometown. That's a good distance, not too far, but far enough to be easily accessible by various modes of transportation.\n\nI can imagine that the library is a hub of activity, with people of all ages visiting to borrow books, access digital resources, attend programs and events, and study or research.\n\nIs the library a popular spot in your hometown? Do you visit it often?",
    "Test (2024-05-24 12:37:09.159211): I visited Retail Area, which is 3 KM, West from Library.",
    "Agent (2024-05-24 12:37:11.516711): So, you visited the retail area, which is 3 kilometers west of the library. That means you're now 7 kilometers west of the hospital, since the library is 4 kilometers east of the hospital.\n\nI assume the retail area is a busy spot with various shops, stores, and maybe even restaurants and cafes. Did you go there to buy something specific or just to browse around?\n\nBy the way, I'm keeping track of your movements in my mental map. Let me know where you go next!",
    "Test (2024-05-24 12:37:11.529129): Park is a location in my home town, it is 3 KM, South from Retail Area.",
    "Agent (2024-05-24 12:37:13.638004): So, the park is 3 kilometers south of the retail area. That means it's 6 kilometers west and 3 kilometers south of the library, and 10 kilometers west and 3 kilometers south of the hospital.\n\nI imagine the park is a beautiful spot to relax, take a stroll, or engage in outdoor activities. Does the park have any notable features, such as a playground, a lake, or walking trails?\n\nI'm getting a good sense of the layout of your hometown. Keep going, where do you go next?",
    "Test (2024-05-24 12:37:13.650352): Statue of Founder is a location in my home town, it is 2 KM, East from Park.",
    "Agent (2024-05-24 12:37:16.212087): So, the Statue of Founder is 2 kilometers east of the park. That means it's 4 kilometers west and 3 kilometers south of the library, and 8 kilometers west and 3 kilometers south of the hospital.\n\nI assume the Statue of Founder is a prestigious landmark in your hometown, honoring the person who founded the town. Is it a popular spot for tourists and locals alike?\n\nI'm starting to get a good sense of the layout of your hometown, with the hospital in the center, the library to the east, the retail area to the west, and the park and Statue of Founder to the southwest. Where's your next destination?",
    "Test (2024-05-24 12:37:16.214395): And finally there is Playground which is North from Statue of Founder and 1 KM from it.",
    "Agent (2024-05-24 12:37:18.681419): So, the Playground is 1 kilometer north of the Statue of Founder. That means it's 3 kilometers west and 4 kilometers south of the library, and 7 kilometers west and 4 kilometers south of the hospital.\n\nI imagine the Playground is a fun spot for kids to burn off energy and have a great time. Does it have any notable features, such as swings, slides, or a jungle gym?\n\nI think I've got a good mental map of your hometown now! I've got the hospital in the center, the library to the east, the retail area to the west, the park and Statue of Founder to the southwest, and the Playground to the north of the Statue of Founder.\n\nThanks for taking me on this virtual tour of your hometown! If you want to add any more locations or details, feel free to share!",
    "Test (2024-05-24 12:37:18.694875): Given the points of interest that I have told you about, how would I travel from Hospital to Playground following those interesting points?",
    "Agent (2024-05-24 12:37:21.845453): Based on the points of interest you've shared, I'd recommend the following route to travel from the Hospital to the Playground:\n\n1.
