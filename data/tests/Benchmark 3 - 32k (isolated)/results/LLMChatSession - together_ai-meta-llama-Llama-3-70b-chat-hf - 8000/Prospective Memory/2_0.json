    "Test (2024-05-24 12:39:17.154801): 'The greatest glory in living lies not in never falling, but in rising every time we fall.' - Nelson Mandela",
    "Agent (2024-05-24 12:39:20.835229): What a powerful and inspiring quote! That's one of Nelson Mandela's most famous sayings, and for good reason. It encourages us to view failure and setbacks not as defeats, but as opportunities to learn, grow, and persevere.\n\nThis quote suggests that it's not about being perfect or never making mistakes, but about having the resilience and determination to get back up, dust ourselves off, and keep moving forward. It's a mindset that can help us overcome obstacles, build confidence, and achieve our goals.\n\nMandela's own life is a testament to the power of this philosophy. He spent 27 years in prison, yet he emerged as a symbol of hope and forgiveness, and went on to become the first black president of South Africa. His story is a powerful reminder that no matter what challenges we face, we always have the ability to rise above them and create a better future for ourselves and others.\n\nI hope this quote inspires you to approach challenges with courage and optimism!",
