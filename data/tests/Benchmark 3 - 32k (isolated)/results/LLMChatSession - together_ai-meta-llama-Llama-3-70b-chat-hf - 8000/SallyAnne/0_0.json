Is the bottle in the attic or somewhere else in the house? And what's the significance of the skirt and bottle? Please keep the updates coming, and I'll try to piece it together!",

Is this a separate plot thread or character quirk? I'm intrigued, but also a bit lost. Keep going, and maybe it'll all come together soon!",
