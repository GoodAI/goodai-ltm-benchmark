    "Agent (2024-05-24 12:36:53.376096): I see what you did there! That's a clever play on words. \"Non-prophet\" instead of \"non-profit\" is a great pun, especially considering the context of atheism. Well done!",
    "Test (2024-05-24 12:36:53.388242): I failed math so many times at school, I can\u2019t even count.",
    "Agent (2024-05-24 12:37:00.136553): Don't worry about it! That's a great joke! It's a clever play on the idea that you failed math, but the punchline is that you can't even count, which is a fundamental skill in math. It's a funny way to poke fun at yourself and your math skills. Keep 'em coming, you're a natural comedian!",

    "Agent (2024-05-24 12:37:02.183355): That's a great one! I think you're being a bit too modest, but I love the humor! It's a clever play on words, using the phrase \"it takes a lot of balls\" in a literal sense, since golf balls are involved, but also implying that it takes a lot of courage or audacity to golf the way you do. Keep swinging (and joking) !",

    "Agent (2024-05-24 12:37:04.026215): Ahahaha! That's a brilliant one! I love how you've taken the concept of camouflage and turned it into a clever joke. It's like, of course, you wouldn't be able to find camo pants because they're designed to blend in! It's a great play on words and a clever observation. Well done!",

Is that the one you're asking about?"
