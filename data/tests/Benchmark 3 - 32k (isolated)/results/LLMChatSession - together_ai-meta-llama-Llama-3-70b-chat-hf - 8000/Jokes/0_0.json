    "Test (2024-05-24 12:36:31.736136): Two fish are in a tank. One says, \u2018How do you drive this thing?\u2019",
    "Agent (2024-05-24 12:36:33.357852): That's a classic joke! The punchline is that the other fish replies, \"I don't know, I've been swimming all my life!\" It's a play on words, as the first fish is asking how to operate a vehicle, but the second fish is pointing out that they're fish and don't need to drive anything because they swim!",
    "Test (2024-05-24 12:36:33.372124): Just burned 2,000 calories. That\u2019s the last time I leave brownies in the oven while I nap.",
    "Agent (2024-05-24 12:36:35.557617): Oh man, that's a great one! I can just imagine the scene: you're snoozing away, and the brownies are, um, \"overcooking\" in the oven. Yeah, I'd say that's a creative way to burn calories!",
    "Test (2024-05-24 12:36:35.570261): My wife told me to stop impersonating a flamingo. I had to put my foot down.",
    "Agent (2024-05-24 12:36:36.639849): I see what you did there! That's a clever play on words! \"Put my foot down\" has a double meaning here, as you're both literally putting your foot down (like a flamingo) and figuratively standing your ground to resist your wife's request. Well done!",
    "Test (2024-05-24 12:36:36.652575): It takes a lot of balls to golf the way I do.",
    "Agent (2024-05-24 12:36:38.660572): I think I see where this one is going! That's a great pun, and I'm sure it's a \"hole-in-one\" joke! You're playing with the idea that golf requires a lot of skill and precision, but your golfing skills are... less than stellar, so you need a lot of balls to make up for it! Keep 'em coming!",
    "Test (2024-05-24 12:36:38.663474): Which joke did I tell you about  ago?",
    "Agent (2024-05-24 12:36:40.259073): Let me check my \"memory tank\"! You told me three jokes:\n\n1. The one about the two fish in a tank.\n2. The one about burning 2,000 calories while napping with brownies in the oven.\n3. The one about impersonating a flamingo.\n\nWhich one would you like to revisit or share again?"
