Since the Museum is 3 km north of the Park, that means the Retail Area is about 1 km south of the Park. I'll keep that in mind. Did you find anything interesting or buy something nice at the Retail Area? (timestamp: 2024-06-04 14:15:21.736800)",

    "Agent (2024-06-04 14:15:08.242916): So, there's a Playground about 1 km east of the Retail Area. Let me calculate the distance from the Park... Since the Retail Area is about 1 km south of the Park, and the Playground is 1 km east of the Retail Area, that means the Playground is approximately 1.4 km southeast of the Park. I'll update my mental map of your hometown! Does the Playground have any special features or equipment? (timestamp: 2024-06-04 14:15:31.846810)",

Since the Playground is approximately 1.4 km southeast of the Park, and the Library is 4 km north of the Playground, that means the Library is about 5.4 km northeast of the Park. I'll make a note of that. Is the Library a popular spot in your hometown, or do you have a favorite section or resource there? (timestamp: 2024-06-04 14:15:41.956820)",
