    "Test (2024-06-03 15:47:31.830511): Two fish are in a tank. One says, \u2018How do you drive this thing?\u2019",
    "Agent (2024-06-03 15:47:36.691157): I remember you! We haven't interacted before, but I'm happy to chat with you now.\n\nAs for the joke, it's a classic! The punchline is that the fish are in a tank, so they don't need to drive anything. It's a play on the typical scenario where someone asks for driving instructions, but in this case, it's a fish who has no need for driving. Do you have any other jokes or topics you'd like to discuss? (timestamp: 2024-06-03 15:47:41.830514)",

    "Agent (2024-06-03 18:42:42.663583): Oh man, that's a great one! I can almost smell the burnt brownies. It's amazing how a simple mistake can lead to a hilarious joke. I'm glad you have a sense of humor about it! By the way, I've noted that you enjoy humor, so I'll make sure to keep the jokes and puns coming. (timestamp: 2024-06-03 18:42:36.696387)",

I'm glad to see that your humor interest is still going strong. Keep 'em coming, and I'll do my best to keep up! (timestamp: 2024-06-03 20:31:42.672577)",
