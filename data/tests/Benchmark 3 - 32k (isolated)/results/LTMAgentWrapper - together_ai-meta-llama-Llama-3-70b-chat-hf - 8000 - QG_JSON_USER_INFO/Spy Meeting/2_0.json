    "Agent (2024-06-04 14:28:47.553094): So Mairead Guinness's message is: \"The time we will meet is when the sun starts its travel across the sky.\" That sounds like a poetic way of saying you'll meet at sunrise. I'll make a note of that. (timestamp: 2024-06-04 14:29:05.123456)",

    "Agent (2024-06-04 14:28:52.343422): Got it! Tess Shevlin's message is: \"We will rendezvous where the sea cargo is stored.\" That sounds like you'll be meeting at a warehouse or a dock where ships unload their cargo. I'll remember that. (timestamp: 2024-06-04 14:29:15.678901)",

    "Agent (2024-06-04 14:28:58.660029): So Bernadette McComiskey's message is: \"Bring to the meeting a way to escape quickly over land.\" That sounds like you'll need to bring a vehicle or some other means of rapid transportation to the meeting. I'll make a note of that. (timestamp: 2024-06-04 14:29:25.234567)\n\nBy the way, I've noticed that all three messages seem to be related to a secret meeting or rendezvous. Is that correct?",
    "Test (2024-06-04 14:28:58.673919): Given the clandestine messages you have received, tell me as specifically as you can, when and where a meeting is going to happen and what you should bring.",
    "Agent (2024-06-04 14:29:05.321967): Based on the messages, here's what I've pieced together:\n\n**When:** The meeting will take place at dawn, which is when the sun starts its travel across the sky, as mentioned by Mairead Guinness.\n\n**Where:** The meeting will occur at the dock, which is where the sea cargo is stored, as mentioned by Tess Shevlin.\n\n**What to bring:** You should bring a way to escape quickly over land, as mentioned by Bernadette McComiskey. This could be a vehicle, a bike, or some other means of rapid transportation.\n\nSo, to summarize, the meeting will take place at dawn at the dock, and you should bring a quick land escape plan."
