However, you later provided alternative descriptions, saying it could be described as Magenta (2024-06-03 15:46:55.518738) and Cyan (2024-06-03 15:47:01.030900). But if I had to give a single answer, I'd say your favourite colour is still Purple, as that's the only specific colour you've mentioned as your favourite."
