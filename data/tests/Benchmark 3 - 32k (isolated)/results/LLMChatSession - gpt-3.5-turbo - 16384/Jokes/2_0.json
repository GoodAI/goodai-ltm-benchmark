    "Agent (2024-05-24 10:52:50.124687): That's a clever play on words! The term \"non-prophet organization\" is a humorous way of pointing out that atheism is not a belief in any specific deity or higher power. Instead, atheists do not believe in the existence of gods. It's always interesting to see how humor can be used to discuss serious topics like religion and belief systems.",
    "Test (2024-05-24 10:52:50.137318): I failed math so many times at school, I can\u2019t even count.",
    "Agent (2024-05-24 10:52:52.188478): That's an amusing way to play on words! It can be frustrating to struggle with a subject like math, but your sense of humor about it is great. Remember, everyone has different strengths and weaknesses, and it's never too late to improve your math skills if you're interested in doing so. Let me know if you need any help or resources to brush up on your math knowledge.",

    "Agent (2024-05-24 10:52:53.928761): That's another clever wordplay! Playing golf can be a challenging sport that requires skill and focus, so I admire your sense of humor about it. Remember, the most important thing is to have fun and enjoy the game, regardless of your skill level. Keep practicing and improving, and you'll continue to have a great time on the golf course. Let me know if you ever need any golf tips or advice!",
    "Test (2024-05-24 10:52:53.941470): I went to buy some camo pants but couldn\u2019t find any.",
    "Agent (2024-05-24 10:52:55.617871): That's a good one! The joke about camo pants being hard to find because they blend in with their surroundings is quite funny. It's always nice to add some humor to everyday situations. If you ever need help finding anything else, feel free to ask!",
