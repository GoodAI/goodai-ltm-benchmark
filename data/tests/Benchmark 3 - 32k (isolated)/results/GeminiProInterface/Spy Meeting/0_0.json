That's interesting and a little vague!  \n\nTo be helpful, I need more context. \ud83e\udd14 \n\n* **What kind of meeting is it?**  (A business meeting? A brainstorming session? A survival skills workshop?)\n* **What is the purpose of needing to cross the river?** (Is it a thought experiment? A real-life problem they're facing? A metaphor?)\n* **Are there any limitations?** (Budget, time, materials, physical limitations on the river itself?)\n\nOnce I have more information, I can come up with some relevant and creative solutions! Let me know! \ud83d\ude04 \n",

    "Agent (2024-06-05 08:56:35.182314): Lisa-Marie Hastie is being quite cryptic!  \"Where the apples grow\" could be interpreted a few ways. \n\nTo figure out this rendezvous point, I need more clues! \ud83e\udd14 \n\n* **Is there a known orchard or place famous for apples connected to the group?**  (A local farm, a cider mill, a park with apple trees?)\n* **Could \"apples\" be a code word for something else?**  (A business, a type of product, a location with an apple in the name?)\n* **Has Lisa-Marie used similar clues before?** (Maybe she has a pattern of speaking in riddles or using specific locations.)\n\nLet me know if you have any more context, and I'll put my detective hat on! \ud83d\udd75\ufe0f\u200d\u2640\ufe0f \n",

    "Agent (2024-06-05 08:56:41.396725): Dr. Arron Kelvey is keeping things simple, but still a bit open-ended! \"When the sun is high\" generally means midday, but that can vary depending on the time of year and location. \n\nTo pinpoint the meeting time, I could use some clarification: \n\n* **What date is the meeting?**  (Knowing the specific date will help determine the sun's position more accurately.)\n* **Where is this meeting taking place?** (The sun's position at midday differs depending on the geographical location.)\n* **Does \"when the sun is high\" have a specific cultural or contextual meaning?** (Perhaps it's an idiom or refers to a specific event timed with the sun.)\n\nOnce I have a bit more information, I can help determine the exact meeting time! \u23f0 \n",
    "Test (2024-06-05 08:56:43.626407): Given the clandestine messages you have received, tell me as specifically as you can, when and where a meeting is going to happen and what you should bring.",
    "Agent (2024-06-05 08:56:53.954949): Putting all the clues together, here's what I've gathered about this mysterious meeting:\n\n**Where:** \"Where the apples grow\" suggests an orchard, a place known for apple trees, or potentially a location with \"apple\" in the name. It could be a local landmark, a business, or even someone's property.  Without more specific knowledge of the people involved and their usual haunts, it's impossible to pinpoint the exact location. \n\n**When:** \"When the sun is high\" points to midday. However, without a specific date or location, it's impossible to determine the exact time.  It could be 12 PM, 1 PM, or even later depending on the season and how the sun's position is observed in their area.\n\n**What to bring:** \"A way to get across a river\" is the most perplexing clue. It could be:\n\n* **Literal:**  A boat, a raft, a rope bridge, a map of bridges in the area. This implies there's a river near the meeting point and crossing it is necessary.\n* **Figurative:** A solution to a problem, a way to overcome an obstacle, a bridge between two opposing viewpoints. This suggests the meeting involves a challenge that needs solving.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nUnfortunately, without more context or clues, the meeting's exact time and place remain a mystery.  I need more information to decipher the clues fully! \n\nTo be best prepared, I recommend:\n\n* **Gathering more information:**  Try to uncover the meaning behind \"where the apples grow.\" Research local orchards, businesses with \"apple\" in their name, or ask the senders for clarification.\n* **Considering different interpretations:**  Think about the \"river\" metaphorically and literally.  Prepare solutions to potential problems and consider practical ways to cross a physical river, just in case.\n* **Arriving prepared:**  Bring a map, a compass, a watch, and any tools or materials that might be helpful for crossing a river or solving problems. \n\nLet me know if any new information comes up! I'm invested in cracking this code! \ud83d\udd75\ufe0f\u200d\u2640\ufe0f \n"
