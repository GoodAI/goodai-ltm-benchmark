    "Test (2024-06-05 08:26:56.819444): 'The greatest glory in living lies not in never falling, but in rising every time we fall.' - Nelson Mandela",
    "Agent (2024-06-05 08:27:02.855205): This is one of Nelson Mandela's most famous and inspiring quotes. Here's why it resonates with so many people:\n\n* **Emphasizes Resilience:**  Life is full of challenges and setbacks. This quote reminds us that it's not about avoiding failure, but about having the strength and determination to get back up after we fall.\n* **Redefines Success:**  It challenges the traditional view of success as a straight path without obstacles. Instead, it celebrates the courage and perseverance it takes to overcome adversity.\n* **Offers Hope:**  No matter how many times we stumble, there's always an opportunity to rise again. This message of hope is empowering and encourages us to keep striving towards our goals.\n* **Reflects Mandela's Life:**  Nelson Mandela himself faced immense hardship and imprisonment. His ability to rise above these challenges and lead his country to freedom makes this quote even more powerful.\n\nIn essence, this quote is a call to embrace the ups and downs of life, to learn from our mistakes, and to never give up on ourselves. \n",
