It's a personal belief system, or lack thereof, and doesn't have the structure or leadership of a typical organization. \n",

You're suggesting you're so bad at math that you can't even do a simple task like counting, which is the foundation of math. \n\nOf course, if you really couldn't count, you wouldn't be able to say you failed math \"many times.\"  \ud83d\ude09 \n",
