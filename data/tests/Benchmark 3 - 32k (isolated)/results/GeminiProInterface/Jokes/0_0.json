    "Test (2024-06-04 09:48:54.258124): Two fish are in a tank. One says, \u2018How do you drive this thing?\u2019",
    "Agent (2024-06-04 09:48:57.940976): This is a classic joke! It's funny because:\n\n* **It plays on words:**  \"Drive\" usually refers to vehicles, but the joke makes us think about how fish move in a tank. \n* **It's absurd:** Fish can't drive, and the idea of them trying is silly.\n\nLet me know if you'd like to hear another joke! \ud83d\ude0a \n",
