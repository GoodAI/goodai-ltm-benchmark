    "Agent (2024-06-05 08:15:26.793971): That's helpful to know! So your hometown has a hospital and a library relatively close to each other. \n\nTo get a clearer picture, could you tell me:\n\n* **What is the name of your hometown?** (Even if you don't want to give the real name, you could make one up!)\n* **Are the hospital and library in the center of town, or more towards the edge?**\n* **Are there any other landmarks or points of interest near the library?** \n\nThe more details you give, the better I can understand the layout of your town! \ud83d\ude0a \n \n",
