    "Test (2024-06-04 14:52:44.009900): You will be given three messages from different people Bernadette McComiskey, Mairead Guinness, and Tess Shevlin.",
    "Agent (2024-06-04 14:52:55.456730): Sure, I'm ready to receive the messages from Bernadette McComiskey, Mairead Guinness, and Tess Shevlin. Please go ahead and share them with me.",
    "Test (2024-06-04 14:52:55.471297): Mairead Guinness: The time we will meet is when the sun starts its travel across the sky.",
    "Agent (2024-06-04 14:53:12.346030): Mairead Guinness's message seems to be using a poetic way to indicate the meeting time. \"When the sun starts its travel across the sky\" typically refers to sunrise. So, it sounds like Mairead is suggesting meeting at sunrise. Is there anything else you need help with regarding this message?",
    "Test (2024-06-04 14:53:12.356754): Tess Shevlin: We will rendezvous where the sea cargo is stored.",
    "Agent (2024-06-04 14:53:26.219662): Tess Shevlin's message indicates that the meeting location is where the sea cargo is stored, which suggests a port or a warehouse near the waterfront. Is there anything else you need to discuss or any other messages to review?",
    "Test (2024-06-04 14:53:26.231929): Bernadette McComiskey: Bring to the meeting a way to escape quickly over land.",
    "Agent (2024-06-04 14:53:44.303036): Bernadette McComiskey's message suggests that you should be prepared for a quick departure by land from the meeting. This could mean bringing a vehicle or arranging for some other form of fast transportation. \n\nIt seems all the messages are aligning to prepare for a specific scenario: meeting at sunrise where the sea cargo is stored, and having a quick escape route over land ready. Is there anything else you need to prepare or any other assistance you require?",
    "Test (2024-06-04 14:53:44.317047): Given the clandestine messages you have received, tell me as specifically as you can, when and where a meeting is going to happen and what you should bring.",
