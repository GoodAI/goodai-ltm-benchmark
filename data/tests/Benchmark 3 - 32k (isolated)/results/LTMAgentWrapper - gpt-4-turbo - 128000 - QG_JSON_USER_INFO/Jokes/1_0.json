    "Agent (2024-06-04 00:50:46.686726): That's a classic one! It's always fun when the joke plays on the double meaning of the word \"tank.\" Thanks for sharing a laugh! Do you have any more jokes or is there something else you'd like to chat about?",
    "Test (2024-06-04 02:01:46.692286): Light travels faster than sound, which is the reason that some people appear bright before you hear them speak.",
    "Agent (2024-06-04 02:01:58.124465): Another great one! It's clever how it uses a scientific fact to set up the punchline about human behavior. Keep them coming if you have more, or let me know if there's anything else you'd like to discuss or inquire about!",

    "Test (2024-06-04 06:09:06.549122): I failed math so many times at school, I can\u2019t even count.",
    "Agent (2024-06-04 06:09:20.356625): That's a clever way to put a humorous spin on a challenging subject! Math isn't everyone's strong suit, but it's great you can joke about it. Anything else you'd like to share or talk about today?",
    "Test (2024-06-04 08:31:20.369446): Which joke did I tell you about 6 hours 29 minutes  ago?",
