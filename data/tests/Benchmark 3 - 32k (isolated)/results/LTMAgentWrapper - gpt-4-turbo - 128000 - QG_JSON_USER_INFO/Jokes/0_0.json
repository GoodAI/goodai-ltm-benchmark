    "Test (2024-06-03 15:52:32.076268): Two fish are in a tank. One says, \u2018How do you drive this thing?\u2019",
    "Agent (2024-06-03 15:52:40.862184): That's a classic one! It's always fun when the joke plays on the double meaning of the word \"tank.\" Thanks for sharing a laugh! Do you have any other jokes or anything else you'd like to chat about?",
    "Test (2024-06-03 18:47:40.866252): Just burned 2,000 calories. That\u2019s the last time I leave brownies in the oven while I nap.",
    "Agent (2024-06-03 18:47:50.982141): Oh no, poor brownies! But that's a clever twist on burning calories. Hopefully, the oven is okay too! If you're up for another attempt at those brownies, I can help you with a recipe or some baking tips. What do you think?",
    "Test (2024-06-03 20:36:50.989350): My wife told me to stop impersonating a flamingo. I had to put my foot down.",

    "Test (2024-06-03 22:28:58.982652): It takes a lot of balls to golf the way I do.",
    "Agent (2024-06-03 22:29:09.488377): Absolutely, that's a great way to put it! Golf can definitely be challenging, especially when those balls seem to have a mind of their own. How often do you get out on the golf course?",
