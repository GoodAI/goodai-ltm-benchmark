    "Test (2024-06-04 08:31:36.427193): Atheism is a non-prophet organization",
    "Agent (2024-06-04 08:31:48.908882): That's a clever play on words! Atheism, indeed, involves a lack of belief in deities and doesn't involve prophets, making it a \"non-prophet\" organization in a literal and punny sense. Humor like this can be a light-hearted way to discuss or think about serious topics. Do you enjoy jokes that involve wordplay?",
    "Test (2024-06-04 10:17:48.911470): I failed math so many times at school, I can\u2019t even count.",
    "Agent (2024-06-04 10:18:06.621250): That's another great example of wordplay! It sounds like you have a knack for humor that uses irony and self-deprecation. Jokes like these can be a fun way to lighten up traditionally stressful topics like math. Do you have any more jokes or puns up your sleeve?",
    "Test (2024-06-04 12:19:06.624652): It takes a lot of balls to golf the way I do.",
    "Agent (2024-06-04 12:19:18.332661): Another great one! That joke plays nicely on the double meaning of \"balls\" \u2014 both courage and the actual golf balls that might end up lost due to wayward shots. It seems like you have a great sense of humor. Do you play golf often, or is it more about the jokes for you?",
    "Test (2024-06-04 13:04:18.337804): I went to buy some camo pants but couldn\u2019t find any.",
    "Agent (2024-06-04 13:04:28.714855): That's a classic! The joke perfectly captures the essence of camouflage. It seems like you really enjoy these clever, pun-based jokes. Do you have a favorite type of humor, or do you like mixing it up with different styles?",
    "Test (2024-06-04 14:20:28.723299): Which joke did I tell you about 5 hours 48 minutes  ago?",
    "Agent (2024-06-04 14:20:38.101550): About 5 hours and 48 minutes ago, you told me the joke: \"Atheism is a non-prophet organization.\" It's a witty play on words!"
