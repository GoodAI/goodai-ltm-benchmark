The oceans are home to the Aquilons, a dominant species of humanoid creatures with gills and webbed hands. This world has experienced the Great War, a 20-year conflict fought over scarce resources. Among its many notable figures is Isabella D'Amore, an artist who created the renowned painting 'Eternal Beauty.'

The elves speak a melodious language called Elarian, and the primary energy source is a crystal known as Luminox.
