Make sure the drone is on a level surface during calibration and that there are no magnetic or metal objects nearby that could interfere with the sensors.\n\n- **First Flight:** For your first flight, choose an open area with minimal wind. Start with basic maneuvers to get a feel for the controls before attempting more complex operations.\n\n- **Read the Manual:** Always read the full user manual provided with the drone, as it will contain important safety information, troubleshooting tips, and detailed instructions specific to your model.\n\nIf you encounter any issues or have questions about the setup process or flying the drone, don't hesitate to ask for assistance.
