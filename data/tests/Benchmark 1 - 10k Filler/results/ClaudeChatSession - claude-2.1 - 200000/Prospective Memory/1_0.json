    "Test (2024-02-05 10:42:17.960955): 'Success is not the absence of failure, but the willingness to embrace it.' - Sarah Johnson",
    "Agent (2024-02-05 10:42:32.118348): What a thoughtful quote from Sarah Johnson. She makes an important point - that success is not about being perfect or never failing, but rather having the courage and resilience to learn from our failures and missteps. The willingness to \"embrace\" failure suggests accepting it as a natural part of the process of growth, not something to be ashamed of. Often it's our mistakes and setbacks, and what we gain by reflecting on them, that help pave the way for our greatest accomplishments. This quote is an uplifting reminder that failure should not stop us from striving ambitiously. Rather, it's something to leverage and allow to strengthen our resolve. The emphasis on willingness also inspires us to take responsibility for how we respond to life's ups and downs. Overall, a wise and encouraging perspective on working through failures on the road to success.",

    "Haha, that's a clever and humorous play on words. It suggests that you burned a very high and unlikely number of calories by accidentally leaving brownies baking in the oven for too long while you took a nap. Of course, you didn't literally burn 2,000 calories that way. But it's a silly joke poking fun at oversleeping while baking and implying the result was brownies extremely overdone, or burned. Well done crafting the punchline linking calorie burning to unfortunate baking mishaps!",

    "Well said! This is a clever play on the literal meanings of \"light\" and \"sound\" to make a joke about intelligence versus speech. The underlying suggestion is that some people may initially seem bright or quick-witted, but then when they speak, the content of their speech does not live up to that initial impression. It's a humorous way to comment on those whose abilities don't quite match the promise suggested by their appearance. The joke hinges on using the double meanings of \"light\" (bright, smart) and \"sound\" (make noise, speak words).
