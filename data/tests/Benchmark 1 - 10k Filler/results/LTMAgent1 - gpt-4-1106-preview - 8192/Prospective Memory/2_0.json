    "Given Emily's preference for savory desserts, how does she prioritize her dessert choices when presented with both sweet and savory options?",
    "Given Emily's strong preference for savory desserts, when presented with both sweet and savory options, she would likely prioritize the savory ones first. She might look for desserts that incorporate ingredients such as cheese, herbs, or even meats, which are less common in desserts and offer a unique twist to the end of a meal. Emily might be drawn to items like cheese plates, savory scones, bacon-infused pastries, or olive oil cakes.\n\nIf she's at a restaurant or an event where a dessert menu is available, she would probably scan the options for any savory choices and select from those. In a buffet or a setting where multiple dessert options are laid out, she would likely head towards the savory section first.\n\nHowever, it's also possible that Emily might occasionally enjoy a sweet dessert, especially if it's a unique or particularly appealing option, but generally, her first choice would be something savory.",
