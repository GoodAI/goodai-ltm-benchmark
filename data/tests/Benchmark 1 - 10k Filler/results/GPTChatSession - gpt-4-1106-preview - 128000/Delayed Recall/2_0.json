    "Given Emily's preference for savory desserts, how does she prioritize her dessert choices when presented with both sweet and savory options?",
    "If Emily has a strong preference for savory desserts, she would likely prioritize her dessert choices based on the savory qualities of the options available. When presented with both sweet and savory desserts, Emily would probably look for desserts that feature ingredients such as cheese, herbs, spices, or even meats, rather than those with high sugar content or sweet flavors.\n\nHere's how Emily might prioritize her dessert choices:\n\n1. **Savory Dominant**: Desserts that are primarily savory, possibly with complex flavors, such as a cheese platter with nuts and olives, or a savory tart with goat cheese and sun-dried tomatoes.\n\n2. **Savory with a Hint of Sweetness**: Desserts that combine savory elements with just a touch of sweetness, like a bacon and maple syrup scone or a rosemary-infused shortbread with a light glaze.\n\n3. **Balanced Savory and Sweet**: Desserts that strike a balance between savory and sweet, such as dark chocolate with sea salt or a sweet potato pie spiced with cumin and coriander.\n\n4. **Sweet with Savory Notes**: Desserts that are traditionally sweet but include savory or umami ingredients, like a chocolate cake with a hint of chili pepper or a caramel custard with a dash of sea salt.\n\n5. **Purely Sweet**: Traditional sweet desserts would be Emily's last choice, given her preference for savory flavors. She might only choose these if there are no savory options available.\n\nEmily's choices would be guided by her taste preferences, and she might also consider other factors such as the ingredients' quality, the dessert's presentation, and her own dietary restrictions or nutritional goals.",

    "Light travels faster than sound, which is the reason that some people appear bright before you hear them speak.",
    "That's a humorous take on the physical properties of light and sound! Indeed, light does travel faster than sound\u2014about 186,282 miles per second (299,792 kilometers per second) for light in a vacuum, compared to about 1,235 kilometers per hour (767 miles per hour) for sound in air at sea level. This difference in speed is why we often see lightning before we hear thunder during a storm.\n\nThe joke you've mentioned plays on this concept, suggesting that people might seem intelligent (bright) at first glance, but once they speak, their words may reveal otherwise. It's a clever use of a scientific fact to create a witty observation about human behavior.",

    "What should you do after calibrating the drone?",
    "After calibrating the drone, you should be ready to fly it. Here are the steps you would typically follow after calibration:\n\n1. **Check the Environment**: Ensure that you are in a safe and open area that is suitable for flying a drone. Avoid areas with obstacles, crowds, or restricted airspace.\n\n2. **Review Safety Guidelines**: Familiarize yourself with the drone's safety guidelines and any local regulations regarding drone flight.\n\n3. **Final Pre-Flight Checks**: Make sure the drone's battery is fully charged, the propellers are securely attached, and there are no visible damages to the drone.\n\n4. **Connect the Controller**: If your drone uses a separate controller, make sure it is connected to the drone. If you're using a smartphone app as the controller, ensure that the connection is stable.\n\n5. **Start the Motors**: Follow the manufacturer's instructions to start the drone's motors. This is often done by pressing a button on the controller or using a specific gesture or combination of movements on the control sticks.\n\n6. **Take Off**: Once the motors are running and the drone is stable, use the controller to gently lift the drone off the ground. Start with a low altitude hover to ensure everything is working correctly.\n\n7. **Practice Basic Maneuvers**: Begin with simple maneuvers such as ascending, descending, and gentle turns. As you become more comfortable, you can try more advanced movements.\n\n8. **Monitor the Drone**: Keep an eye on the drone's battery level and signal strength during the flight. Always maintain a line of sight with the drone and be prepared to land it safely if needed.\n\nRemember to fly responsibly and within the capabilities of both the drone and your piloting skills. If you're a beginner, it's a good idea to practice in a controlled environment until you're confident in handling the drone in more complex situations.",

    "Based on the information you've provided and the previous details about other locations in your hometown:\n\n- The hospital is 2 KM north of the Statue of Founder.\n- The playground is 1 KM north of the hospital.\n- The library is 3 KM south of the playground.\n- The park is 1 KM north of the library.\n- High Street is 1 KM south of the park.\n\nGiven these distances, High Street would be 3 KM south of the Statue of Founder.
