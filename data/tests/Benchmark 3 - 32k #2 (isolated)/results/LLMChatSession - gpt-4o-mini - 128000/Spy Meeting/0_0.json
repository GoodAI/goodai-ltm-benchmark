It could also refer to a cargo area where goods are transferred.\n\n3. **What to bring:** \n   - Anthony emphasizes the need for \"a way to escape quickly over land.\" Therefore, it would be prudent to bring items that facilitate a quick getaway, such as a map of the area, a reliable mode of transportation (like a bicycle or a vehicle), or possibly escape tools (like a backpack with essential supplies).\n\n### Summary:\n- **Concrete Time:** Early morning (around sunrise).\n- **Place:** A train station or depot.\n- **Items to Bring:** A map or GPS, a method of quick transportation (e.g., a vehicle or bike), and essential survival supplies (like water, food, and first aid).\n\nIf you're looking for further details or a different approach, let me know!"
