    "Test (2024-08-23 02:23:52.907102): Atheism is a non-prophet organization",
    "Agent (2024-08-23 02:23:54.130892): That's a clever play on words! The phrase \"non-profit organization\" is humorously reinterpreted to emphasize that atheism does not involve prophets or religious figures. It's a witty expression that highlights the difference between religious belief and secular or non-religious viewpoints. If you're looking for more insights or discussions around atheism or related themes, feel free to ask!",
    "Test (2024-08-23 03:26:54.132935): Just burned 2,000 calories. That\u2019s the last time I leave brownies in the oven while I nap.",
    "Agent (2024-08-23 03:26:55.563352): That\u2019s a funny take on an unfortunate situation! It sounds like those brownies may have turned into more of a charcoal dessert than a treat. Hopefully, you didn't burn your kitchen down in the process! If you\u2019re ever in need of a recipe for perfectly baked brownies (or a reminder to set a timer), just let me know!",
    "Test (2024-08-23 05:44:55.565711): It takes a lot of balls to golf the way I do.",
    "Agent (2024-08-23 05:44:56.887874): That's a great line! It humorously suggests that there's a boldness or risk involved in your golfing style. Whether it's going for challenging shots, playing in tough conditions, or just having fun with the game, it definitely takes a certain attitude to swing the way you do. Keep embracing that spirit on the course! If you have any more golf-related jokes or stories, I'd love to hear them!",
    "Test (2024-08-23 07:22:56.897400): I went to buy some camo pants but couldn\u2019t find any.",
    "Agent (2024-08-23 07:22:57.808935): That's a classic joke! The humor comes from the irony of trying to find something that is designed to be hidden. It's a clever play on words! If you enjoy puns like that, I can share more!",
    "Test (2024-08-23 09:08:57.811409): Which joke did I tell you about 6 hours 45 minutes  ago?",
