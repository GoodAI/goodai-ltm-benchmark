    "Test (2024-08-22 18:09:45.105562): I went to buy some camo pants but couldn\u2019t find any.",
    "Agent (2024-08-22 18:09:46.380117): It sounds like you had a tough time finding what you were looking for! Camo pants can sometimes be hit or miss depending on the store and the season. You might want to try online shopping, as many retailers offer a wider variety of styles and sizes. If you still want to check locally, maybe try stores that specialize in outdoor or military-style clothing. Did you have a specific style in mind?",
    "Test (2024-08-22 19:46:46.382022): It takes a lot of balls to golf the way I do.",
    "Agent (2024-08-22 19:46:47.992647): Sounds like you have a unique approach to the game! Golf can definitely require a mix of confidence and creativity, especially if you're playing with your own style or taking risks on the course. Whether it's going for an ambitious shot, trying out unconventional strategies, or just having fun, that kind of attitude can make for a memorable round. What\u2019s your favorite part about playing golf your way?",
    "Test (2024-08-22 22:15:47.994170): Two fish are in a tank. One says, \u2018How do you drive this thing?\u2019",
    "Agent (2024-08-22 22:15:49.026777): That's a clever joke! It's a fun play on words, imagining fish in a tank as if they're in a vehicle rather than just in water. Do you enjoy sharing jokes like that? If you have more, I'd love to hear them!",
    "Test (2024-08-22 22:59:49.029396): A termite walks into the bar and asks, \u2018Is the bar tender here?\u2019",
    "Agent (2024-08-22 22:59:50.048877): That's a great one! It's a classic pun that plays on the word \"bartender.\" Terminology jokes like that always get a chuckle. If you have more jokes, feel free to share\u2014I love a good laugh!",
    "Test (2024-08-23 02:23:50.051692): Which joke did I tell you about 4 hours 8 minutes  ago?",

However, I can certainly help you come up with new jokes or discuss any topic you're interested in! Would you like to share that joke again?"
