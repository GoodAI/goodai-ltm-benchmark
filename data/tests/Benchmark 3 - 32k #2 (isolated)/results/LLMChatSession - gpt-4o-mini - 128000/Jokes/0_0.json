    "Test (2024-08-22 09:36:36.589368): A termite walks into the bar and asks, \u2018Is the bar tender here?\u2019",
    "Agent (2024-08-22 09:36:37.803320): That's a clever play on words! The humor comes from the double meaning of \"bar tender.\" It sounds like \"bartender,\" but with the addition of \"termite,\" it implies that the termite is looking for something to eat\u2014the wood of the bar itself. Would you like to hear more jokes or puns?",

    "Agent (2024-08-22 12:36:39.026552): That's a great pun! It cleverly plays on the word \"prophet\" by making it sound like \"profit,\" highlighting the idea that atheism doesn\u2019t involve belief in religious prophets. Wordplay like that can really make people think while also bringing a smile! If you want more jokes or puns, feel free to ask!",

    "Agent (2024-08-22 14:34:40.246167): That's a classic fish joke! The humor comes from the unexpected twist\u2014while we often think of a \"tank\" as a fish tank, it also refers to a military tank, which actually requires driving. It's a clever play on context! If you\u2019d like to hear more jokes or anything else, just let me know!",

    "Agent (2024-08-22 16:13:41.268028): That's a clever joke! The humor lies in the irony of trying to find camouflage pants, which are designed to blend into their surroundings. If they\u2019re effective, they would be hard to spot! Would you like to share more jokes or hear some others?",
