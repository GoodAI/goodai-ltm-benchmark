    "Test (2024-08-23 09:10:22.389158): 'Love your Enemies, for they tell you your Faults.' - Benjamin Franklin",
    "Agent (2024-08-23 09:10:23.894543): The quote \"Love your enemies, for they tell you your faults\" by Benjamin Franklin suggests that those who oppose or challenge us can provide valuable insights into our weaknesses and mistakes. Rather than viewing enemies purely as adversaries, Franklin encourages us to appreciate their criticism, as it can lead to personal growth and self-improvement. By embracing this perspective, one can turn conflict into an opportunity for reflection and learning. This mindset fosters resilience and the ability to view challenges as pathways to becoming better individuals.",
