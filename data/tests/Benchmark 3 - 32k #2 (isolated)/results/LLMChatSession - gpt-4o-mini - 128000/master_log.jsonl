Thoughts keep getting tangled in my head    This is a side of him that no one\u2019s ever seen. It\u2019s true for Taehyung too, but even more so for himself. It\u2019s not like he hasn\u2019t slept over friend\u2019s houses, or no one else has ever seen him sleeping before. But this. This is different. The light coming from the window is usually scarce, because Jungkook doesn\u2019t like waking up with the sun in his eyes, nor does Taehyung. However, the night before Taehyung had insisted that they should watch the stars together, because he\u2019s been studying them and he wanted to show everything he had learned to Jungkook as well. (Jungkook was studying them too, because he was really curious about things, especially things Taehyung was curious about, but he enjoyed to listen to Taehyung talk as if he was teaching him from scratch, his observations and words always beautiful and way more interesting than the ones Jungkook had read on the internet.) So, this time around, Taehyung\u2019s face is clear and bright under the morning light, the slope of his nose highlighted, each and every mole apparent, lips puffed and slightly parted, face squished against the pillow by Jungkook\u2019s side on Jungkook\u2019s bed. And Jungkook stares, because he\u2019s not fully awake just yet. He takes a while to wake up, always have, and therefore there\u2019s nothing to stop him from staring. Even blinking comes slow and lazily, and that has nothing to do with the fact he\u2019s a little hypnotized by the view. It\u2019s just how it is. How things are. How he is. Hopefully, how they are. It\u2019s simply not a step he\u2019s willing to take. Not right now. A step bigger than his legs are, that\u2019s what it feels like. He wants to reach for it, oh, Jungkook does. But that might scare Taehyung away. Taehyung isn\u2019t ready for that just yet. And that\u2019s really fine. Just, moments like this, under the rising sun, on his bed, by Taehyung\u2019s side, this feels all too different. Too beautiful, too good, too much. His chest aches, then, for something. A warmth. Someone. A proximity lacking, and he needs it then, as if his life depends on it, his chest is pulling Taehyung to him, begging, screaming, heart threatening to burst through if Jungkook doesn\u2019t do something, anything. Maybe it works, and the thing inside his chest is so strong that it manages to make Taehyung stir in his sleep, and literally roll to Jungkook\u2019s side. Or it\u2019s just Taehyung, being Taehyung, and squishing his face into Jungkook\u2019s chest is just way better than any pillow could ever be. He sighs in contentment, sinking further into Jungkook\u2019s aching chest, and in a moment it\u2019s like there was never any pain there, to begin with. I must be going crazy, is what Jungkook thinks, breathing through his nose as slowly and quietly as he can. \u201c\u2018Mmnornin, Koo.\u201d  A heartbeat\u2014one Taehyung certainly hears, left ear pressed against Jungkook\u2019s heart\u2014and a soft smile on Jungkook\u2019s lips as he replies, voice hoarse from sleep:  \u201cGood morning, Taetae.\u201d  And Jungkook is glad he gets to wake up like this a bunch of days. Because this. This is special. On other days he wakes up with a punch to the stomach, yeah, sometimes even with a pair of feet resting way too close to his face, but still. Still, this isn\u2019t something he\u2019d ever trade. \t2. Chapter 2  The bad thing about sleeping with Jungkook is the one thing that shouldn\u2019t be bad at all about sleeping. Only, it\u2019s 7h10 and Taehyung really needs to wake up, really needs to get ready to work, really needs to _get out of bed._  But capitalism. As Yoongi said, capitalism ruined the simplest, most beautiful thing ever. Sleep. But it\u2019s _sooo gooood!_ Sleeping is too good, and sleeping with Jungkook, really, he had to be doing something to Taehyung, be it sprinkling suspicious substances on his water or even magic, Jungkook definitely had a secret under his sleeves. Something to make Taehyung sleep like a rock, and wake up like he just had the best night of rest in years, but also like he could keep on sleeping like that forever. _Drugs._ That should be it. Because it _is_ addicting. Once he found his way into Jungkook\u2019s bed, it was really hard to resist the urge of inviting himself in every night. He only did it for the sake of Jungkook not getting tired of him, and throwing him out of their shared apartment. \u201cKoo, we gotta wake up now.\u201d  Jungkook mumbles this time, maybe they took a ten minutes nap from the moment they exchanged good mornings. It happens frequently. Taehyung pokes his ribs, rather carefully, but the location guarantees an immediate reaction. The body under him moved, and Taehyung looks up to find an angry look pointed down at his face. \u201cMust you hurt me in order to wake me up, Taehyung?\u201d  \u201cYeah. Otherwise, you never do, not as fast as we need you to, at least. Plus, that didn\u2019t really hurt, you\u2019re just being a baby.\u201d  \u201cIt hurt. I\u2019m very sensitive when I wake up.\u201d  Taehyung almost beams at the slip-up, his day already made when his lips part and he pronounces very attentively:  \u201cOh?\u201d  Jungkook is torn between blushing and grunting, and that gets a pillow smashed into Taehyung\u2019s face. \u201cWhy are you like this?\u201d He rolls out of bed, maybe suppressing his laughter. Taehyung giggles, getting up too. \u201cThis is an important piece of information, Koo, I can tell your future girlfriend about it, and that\u2019s gonna be good for you later.\u201d  He winks, and Jungkook visibly rolls his eyes. \u201cYeah, and she wouldn\u2019t find it suspicious at all that you somehow seem to have this important piece of information.\u201d  Taehyung realizes\u00a0a lot of things at once, but the most important one is that Jungkook shouldn\u2019t get a girlfriend anytime soon. That would mean the end of their nights sleeping together. He feels too selfish to actually say that out loud, so he moved to the bathroom instead, Jungkook\u2019s bathroom, and grabbed his toothbrush, his extra toothbrush that has been used more times than his actual toothbrush, almost forgotten at his own bathroom. Still, Jungkook is too attentive to let something like this pass by unnoticed, his eyes are careful on Taehyung and some of the hairs on his nape bristle as an effect. Jungkook walks to his side and grabs his own toothbrush. \u201cWhat?\u201d  Taehyung stops brushing. \u201cPromise me one thing.\u201d  \u201cHuh?\u201d  \u201cJust say you\u2019ll promise me one thing.\u201d  Jungkook looks down to his toothbrush as he puts on some toothpaste. \u201cThat\u2019s already a promise, Tae.\u201d  \u201cWhatever. Then promise twice.\u201d  Jungkook smiles, rather softly. \u201cYeah, okay.\u201d  \u201cHm. Good.\u201d Taehyung takes the toothbrush off his mouth, and lowers himself to spit on the sink. When he rises again, Jungkook is brushing his teeth, waiting only mildly curiously. \u201cThen promise we\u2019ll still do everything we do now even if we start dating someone.\u201d  His brain supplies an \u201celse\u201d that stays on Taehyung\u2019s mind only, echoing like a disturbing horror movie sound. He\u2019s got no idea why he thought that, but it\u2019s probably just a habit, from usually saying the words \u201csomeone else\u201d together. Jungkook nods within a heartbeat, and that\u2019s enough to appease Taehyung messy head. Then he looks surprised, as if he had just understood what Taehyung has said. Not what he _asked,_ but what was being said behind all that. He\u2019s smug the rest of that hellish day, as Taehyung leaves to his own bathroom to shower (not before Jungkook purposely gets toothpaste on his nose), as they prepare tea and eat before leaving, on the way to the bus stop, all the way to the subway station, Jungkook doesn\u2019t utter a word but his smile says everything. _I didn\u2019t know I was_ **_that_ ** _important to you._ \t3. Chapter 3  They met during college, both music students, Taehyung already a trainee at the Orchestra that Jungkook was applying for an internship. At some point, they started going to work together, then they were going to college together too, and sharing the touring road trips together, and suddenly they were\u2026 living under the same roof. It happened naturally. It was a better location, rent cheaper than they were paying before, because they could split the bills. It was only reasonable. And, well, the company was not unwelcome at all. Jungkook is a trainee now, recently graduated, so he usually arrives home first. Taehyung is a junior, and he\u2019s far from being a workaholic \u2014 that\u2019s easily a lot more like Jungkook \u2014 , but in between distractions he always comes home around eight p.m., while Jungkook is sometimes free even before six. Their roles on the Orchestra had nothing to do with their work titles \u2014 that was more salary and work hours related. Whereas Jungkook was a pianist, Taehyung played the cello. Neither of them were soloists yet, but their Orchestra was a little different than the most formal ones. This Thursday, however, Taehyung had promised to get home as soon as he could, so he could help Jungkook with the laundry. _ The laundry _ is a very specific procedure which Jungkook prefers to take care of himself. He had his own difficulties in the beginning, but by now he was quite the expert in washing machines. Well, at least with the washing machine that was  _ theirs. _  He never denied the company, however, and Taehyung could never stay still for too long, not even when he was lying down. \u201cGod, Tae, that was too much detergent.\u201d  \u201cThat\u2019s what you put the last time! I paid attention.\u201d  His forehead creases, lips pressed tightly together on a pout. \u201cYeah, and we found out that night that it was too much detergent! And we had a lot more clothes inside back then\u2026\u201d They were getting the hang of the whole house chores thing, the days where clothes would pile up until they were almost a living creature left way behind them. They exchange quizzical looks. Taehyung\u2019s smile is practically sly as he pushes the start button. \u201cWe\u2019ll have to wash it all twice. Mark my words.\u201d Jungkook sighs, defeated. \u201cWanna bet?\u201d  That makes him take a 180 degrees turn. \u201cWhat?\u201d  \u201cDinner. It\u2019s on me if you\u2019re right. You can choose.\u201d  \u201cWill we go out?\u201d  \u201cSure. Not too far, though, I know you\u2019re tired.\u201d  Jungkook shrugs. He is, and so must be Taehyung \u2014 it was a long week \u2014 , but they rarely ever go out to eat. \u201cDeal.\u201d  They deal with the first batch of clothes while the washing machine works, and soon the foam leaking out of the machinery\u2019s door is a good enough indicative that, yeah, Jungkook was right after all. Unfortunately, they only notice the foam the moment when Taehyung slips on it. It all happens in slow motion right in front of Jungkook\u2019s widened eyes. A jacket is thrown to the ceiling, Taehyung\u2019s arms reaching for any kind of support as he falls to his imminent death. Or so it looks like, which prompts Jungkook to react as fast and best as he can. That doesn\u2019t guarantee, however, that the results are anything different from the both of them falling down, weirdly tangled, but all the heads involved in the disaster are  _ safely  _ away from the floor and all the pointy corners surrounding them. \u201cOuch, my ass.\u201d  Jungkook breathes in a ridiculous amount of air. \u201cLeast it wasn\u2019t that thing attached to your neck which apparently you never use for anything at all.\u201d  \u201cHey! No need to get all aggressive on me now.\u201d  Jungkook grunts. \u201cMy back\u2026\u201d  Taehyung scrambles to get off of him, sitting up. \u201cDid you hit it somewhere? Are you hurt? I\u2013\u201d  \u201cNo. It\u2019s just a little sore, it\u2019s nothing.\u201d  \u201cYou sure?\u201d  A small sigh leaves his lips, and Jungkook helplessly smiles. \u201cYeah. You?\u201d   Taehyung visibly relaxes, eyes closing as his lips shape into a signature boxy-smile. \u201cYeah, thanks to you! My hero.\u201d  \u201cDon\u2019t go quoting anime on me right now.\u201d  \u201cI\u2019m only quoting because you can recognize it, otherwise I\u2019d just be  _ saying _ it. It\u2019s a normal phrase, you weeb. People say that all the time.\u201d  \u201cThe frequency and the generalization are both highly debatable. Anyway, I win.\u201d  \u201cHuh?\u201d  \u201cThe bet. I want barbecue, by the way.\u201d  \u201cHuuh?\u201d Taehyung\u2019s face gets impossibly close, closer than it was when they were literally tangled. \u201cYou\u2019re really going for my savings here, Koo.\u201d  Jungkook laughs, which grants him foam at his right cheek. Foam he never saw coming because he had a serious case of Taehyung tunnel-vision. But even after a battle with the detergent\u2019s foam\u2014there are no winners, both of them sticky and dirty \u2014 , and the shower they have to take while the washing machine works for the second time, Taehyung never mentions it again. \u201cHey, we don\u2019t really have to\u2026\u201d  \u201cShh, I was just playing with you. Barbecue is great, actually. That\u2019s what money\u2019s for, right?\u201d  Taehyung\u2019s face disappears behind a floral shirt, and they resume hanging out the clothes. \u201cEating?\u201d  The shirt wavers as he hears a chuckle. \u201cThat, too.\u201d  _ And what else? _  Jungkook waits, but Taehyung never explains himself. \t4. Chapter 4  \u201cOh, I\u2019m sorry, I have plans for tonight already.\u201d  Jiwoo\u2019s smile doesn\u2019t waver, as kind and collected as it was a moment ago, when she offered an invitation to the pub nearby, along with at least half of their musicians. \u201cWhere are you going? Perhaps we can meet at some point\u2026 just to say hi? It\u2019s a group hangout, after all.\u201d  \u201cHahah, I don\u2019t think that will happen, no, my plans involve staying in.\u201d  \u201cReally? You could do that another time, though\u2026\u201d  Has he been avoiding hanging out with his coworkers that much? No, not really, they almost never did this kind of thing, maybe that\u2019s why Jiwoo was being so forceful. However, she wasn\u2019t being invasive. Her tone was respectful and inviting. \u201cDefinitely not, no, I promised Jungkook we would do a movie marathon and eat popcorn. He\u2019s never going to forgive me if I make him leave the house instead. To a pub.\u201d  He laughs, and Jiwoo nods, tilting her head", "is_question": false}}

I care about all of my friends.\u201d  Even as he says it, Taehyung feels the lie on his tongue. It tastes weird, and kind of bitter, because it isn\u2019t a lie. He\u00a0 _is_ a good friend, always has been, and he\u2019s got a pretty chunky list of people who could vow to that. But\u2026 it\u2019s a lot more than his responsibility as a friend, here. And of course, of course it is, Jungkook is a very dear friend with whom Taehyung really enjoys to spend time with. So why the hell would he cancel on Jungkook, if he actually had been waiting for their night in the whole week? He never voices that, parting ways a little awkwardly. It\u2019s like Jiwoo is waiting for something he\u2019s got no idea _what_ might be. Luckily, he doesn\u2019t dwell too long on it. Taehyung goes to the nearest market and buys ice cream too, mint chocolate flavored because it's Jungkook's favorite, and soon enough he is home. No one questioning him, only popcorn and a movie night with Jungkook ahead of him. Who would even dare to prefer a pub to this? Everything\u2019s already arranged, even if Jungkook isn\u2019t on sight. Pillows from both bedrooms spread on the floor, with their blankets and comforters making a nicer mattress than the couch. \u201cTae?\u201dJungkook\u2019s voice comes from the kitchen, at Taehyung\u2019s left. He puts his shoes away before answering. \u201cYep.\u201d  \u201cGo shower, I\u2019m cooking lamen.\u201d  \u201cCooking, right,\u201d Taehyung teases, entering the small kitchen and going for the freezer. Jungkook stops midway what would possibly be a complain the second he sees what Taehyung is doing. \u201cIce cream? Is it ice cream?\u201d  Taehyung shrugs, hiding the package as best as he can as he stores it inside the refrigerator. \u201cIt\u2019s a surprise.\u201d  The faintest smile passes through Jungkook\u2019s frame before he fakes annoyance, furrowing his eyebrows and frowning. Taehyung sprints to his bathroom, taking the quickest shower of his entire life and rushing back to the cozy living room, where he finds Jungkook this time around, sitting surrounded by the pillows, and starring the lamen cups with big, hungry eyes. \u201cOnly four?\u201d  He points to the floor beside him, where another four lamen cups remain closed, next to a thermal jug which is probably filled with hot water. Of _course_ there was more. Taehyung sits by Jungkook\u2019s side and they start their marathon, burning their tongues and crying from the extra spice of the lamens, emptying a few water bottles before finishing six of the eight cups. It\u2019s comfortable between them, intimacy coming naturally with gentle and tender touches, even when Jungkook pokes his ribs, or Taehyung flicks his earlobe, this is even more comfortable than the nest made of pillows and blankets on the floor. There isn't much space left for the popcorn after that, but they manage. And desserts get a whole other stomach for them, Jungkook's eyes shining so brightly it almost blinds Taehyung in the darkness of their home. They eat from the pot, and Jungkook almost gets a brain freeze, saved by Taehyung physically pulling it away from his grip. The movies are dumb, zombie comedies, and they manage to get to the third one before Jungkook starts to doze off, head falling on Taehyung\u2019s shoulder. Still, he struggles against the sleep, refusing to go to bed and pretending to be awake every time Taehyung says something. He can\u2019t help but smile fondly, and discreetly try to make their position more adequate for Jungkook to sleep. They have two beds, and a perfectly good sofa, but every once in a while sleeping on the living room floor isn\u2019t that bad, either. \t5. Chapter 5  He only ever heads back home by himself if there\u2019s something waiting for him to do that can\u2019t be dealt with later. Most times, there\u2019s a lot he can do near work: groceries, bookstores, malls. The possibilities are endless, and time waiting for Taehyung is too scarce for him to even notice. Soon enough his phone chimes and it certainly is Taehyung asking if he\u2019s still around. Sometimes he heads home first, even cooks a little something for dinner\u2014Taehyung always praises his food, and Jungkook thinks he\u2019s just talking his ears off because he wants Jungkook to cook more. Either way, he can\u2019t deny that it works a _little._ And he himself thinks his food isn\u2019t half as bad as it could be. But one thing rarely changes, even during the weekends. It\u2019s almost as if Taehyung _puts him to bed._  Not literally, Jungkook isn\u2019t a kid anymore, but he is kind of an insomniac. Taehyung has his own moments, too, but Jungkook is really worse. He forgets to sleep, he doesn\u2019t notice the time passing by, and he\u2019s awful at dealing with his own insomnia. The biggest proof of that is: He has some sick playlists to help him sleep, but does he remember to use them? So the first thing that happens is: Taehyung brews him some tea. And Taehyung takes that pretty seriously\u2014he\u2019s studied all kinds of plants and herbs after the best teas he could make to help Jungkook. They are ridiculously good, too, and how Taehyung manages this is out of his comprehension. Then, as Jungkook drinks the tea, Taehyung talks. He talks about trivial things, voice serene and low, lulls Jungkook\u2019s brain into a false state of peacefulness. He\u2019s always liked Taehyung\u2019s voice, that ain\u2019t something new. Listening to it to sleep has its disadvantages\u2014that\u2019s how the dreams started\u2014, but are they really disadvantages? When the tea ends, Taehyung drags Jungkook to bed and keeps talking his ears off. Jungkook talks back, too, some times more than others, but his tongue drags heavier inside his mouth. His own voice is deeper than usual, letting his tiredness show. The tea sure has an effect, his eyelids can barely hold up, and he _likes_ to hear Taehyung talk. Taehyung can be silent for long times, and Jungkook likes that, too, but Taehyung\u2019s voice seems to make his heart overflow. Sadly, it\u2019s not always that Taehyung stays. For some reason Jungkook can\u2019t understand, he has to go to his own bed. He considers disposing of Taehyung\u2019s bed a few times, but then he would have to give up the times Taehyung invited him to his bed instead of joining in Jungkook\u2019s one, and he wasn\u2019t ready for that yet. It was nice and different when they watched a drama or anime in _Taehyung\u2019s_ bed. And Taehyung _invited_ him to stay. Jungkook liked sleeping in Taehyung\u2019s bed too, and for that to keep happening Taehyung had to have his own bed. Unfortunately. Watching anime before bed is a big no\u2014they both get way too excited, and end up sleeping way past one in the morning. That, sometimes, happens. But not much. Taehyung takes sleeping seriously, for his sake. Which is why most of the times he leaves Jungkook\u2019s bed when he thinks Jungkook is already asleep, Jungkook won\u2019t say anything. Most times, however, aren\u2019t tonight. On some rare occasions such as now, Jungkook reaches his left hand, towards Taehyung\u2019s wrist, and grabs it gently. \u201cYou\u2019re still awake?\u201d Taehyung whispers, surprised. They barely slept that Saturday, waking up to sunlight on their faces because the living room windows are big and the curtains translucent. The movie marathon the night before had Jungkook sleeping on the floor, he just didn\u2019t want it to end. \u201cBarely,\u201d he answers, not even opening his eyes. Taehyung waits in silence for a moment, then asks: \u201cYou want something?\u201d   _Stay,_ Jungkook thinks. _You don\u2019t have to go._  \u201cNah,\u201d he answers instead, suddenly way more nervous than he should be. What was he thinking? Why did he reach for Taehyung when Taehyung clearly wanted to leave? \u201c... Then?\u201d  Jungkook loosens the grip on Taehyung\u2019s wrist, pulling back. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing. Sorry.\u201d  Silence befalls the room, Taehyung isn\u2019t moving and Jungkook is definitely getting more anxious by the second. He opens his eyes at the same time Taehyung lays down again. \u201cI\u2019m staying. My job here isn\u2019t done yet.\u201d  Jungkook chuckles, closing his eyes again in a dumb attempt at hiding his embarrassment. \u201cThat\u2019s not your _job_.\u201d  \u201cHmph. Who said that?\u201d He can hear Taehyung moving closer, until his body is wrapping around Jungkook\u2019s waist, pressing his face against Taehyung\u2019s chest. \u201cThey\u2019re right, but only because I\u2019m doing this because I want to. Now, let\u2019s go to sleep, Koo. Good night.\u201d  Jungkook lets out a breath he didn\u2019t know he was holding. \u201cNight.\u201d  It\u2019s a little strangled, but Taehyung tightens the embrace and runs his fingers through Jungkook\u2019s hair, and soon enough he\u2019s not conscious enough to be nervous about anything at all. \t6. Chapter 6  Neither of them has a car, therefore, groceries have to be bought in parcels, little by little. That\u2019s not a problem. Taehyung loves grocery shopping. Jungkook spaces out through most of it, dutifully pushing the shopping cart, even though he enjoys the food bits. And there are always food bits, no matter how many times they hit the market. \u201cDetergent _again_?\u201d Jungkook asks, startled to see it inside their cart. \u201cYes? Have you seen the number of dishes we make?\u201d  \u201cHave you seen the amount of _laundry_ we make? And we\u2019re not buying detergent for _that_ again.\u201d  Taehyung shakes his head, chuckling. \u201cOh, honey, that\u2019s not how this works.\u201d  Jungkook\u2019s face heats up instantly, and he focuses on hiding it instead of arguing. Taehyung must be right, he\u2019s the one who can\u2019t see a single spoon on the kitchen sink before he\u2019s doing the dishes again. A worker nearby drops one of the cans she\u2019s piling up on the bottom shelf, attracting both their eyes for a second. \u201cAnyway, last time we bought this was just a test, sometimes I\u2019m allergic to detergents. This one is good, though, and it\u2019s cheaper too, so we\u2019re buying more.\u201d  Jungkook shrugs. \u201cFair enough.\u201d  \u201cWhat else is on the list?\u201d  \u201cCereals. And eggs.\u201d  \u201cOh, this way then!\u201d  They stop when there\u2019s enough to fill four\u2014ecological\u2014bags, heading to the single counter and waiting for the cashier to come. It\u2019s a small market, a little farther from their apartment building than other markets, but Taehyung likes to support local businesses such as this one. And so does Jungkook, who also appreciates the extras they get whenever the owners are around, and the homemade treats they always have. \u201cLook, Tae, homemade melonpan!\u201d  Taehyung eyes it with curiosity. Their melonpan is his favorite. \u201cIs it fresh?\u201d  Before Jungkook can check the date, the same worker from before answers, assuming the cashier\u2019s place. \u201cYes! They were baked today.\u201d  \u201cCan we buy them? Can we, Tae?\u201d  Jungkook\u2019s eyes sparkle, as if Taehyung was ever going to deny him and he needed to resort to such a low trick. \u201cSure, you big baby.\u201d  The woman chuckles as Jungkook gets them _four_ packages, and Taehyung flicks his earlobe and messes with his hair, almost annoyed with his cuteness. \u201cHow long have you two been together, if you don\u2019t mind me asking?\u201d  Taehyung\u2019s smile fades into confusion as he stops looking at Jungkook and turns to the cashier. \u201cUh?\u201d It\u2019s Jungkook who asks, though, eyes big and curious. The cashier fumbles with the groceries, visibly flustered. \u201cUm, you two live together, right?\u201d  \u201cYeah, but\u2026\u201d  Taehyung interrupts him, throwing his arm around Jungkook\u2019s shoulders. \u201cAlmost two years, ain\u2019t it, Koo?\u201d  \u201cHuh? Tae, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s what-\u201d  Taehyung nods, turning back to her. \u201cAlmost two years now!\u201d  The woman nods, smiling shyly. \u201cYou\u2026 both seem really happy, that\u2019s all. Sorry if I stepped out of line...\u201d  \u201cNot at all! We don\u2019t really keep track of time because it\u2019s just so effortless. Time passes too fast. I am happy. Aren\u2019t you, Koo?\u201d  Jungkook nods, albeit visibly stunned. The cashier finishes helping them with their groceries, and as soon as they step out of the market, Jungkook says, very slowly:  \u201cI have no idea what just happened.\u201d  Taehyung laughs, nerves hidden by how loud he allows himself to be now that they\u2019re out in the open. \u201cMr. and Ms. Jun hired a nice woman, that\u2019s what happened, Koo.\u201d  He still looks confused, but Taehyung is carrying both bags with the same hand just so he can keep his other arm around Jungkook\u2019s shoulders, and he\u2019s not going to say anything that could possibly ruin this. The night is a bit chilly, after all. \t7. Chapter 7  \u201cI\u2019d rather die.\u201d  \u201cLovely. We still promised Hoseok we would go. Even _Min Yoongi_ is going.\u201d  \u201cThat I\u2019ll have to see with my own two eyes to believe it.\u201d  \u201cThen _wake up,_ Taehyung.\u201d  Jungkook pushes him for real this time, and Taehyung almost falls off the bed. This is why he\u2019s usually the first one to wake up, and not the other way around. As he huffs and grumbles in surprise, all Jungkook does is _laugh._  _So inconsiderate._  \u201cI was almost there!\u201d  \u201cYou\u2019ve been almost there for the past thirty minutes. Breakfast is ready, you have five minutes to get ready and move your ass to the kitchen.\u201d  \u201cHarsh.\u201d  In truth, it\u2019s really hard to wake up and get ready fast when the perspective of running a marathon is the only thing on his horizon. On a Sunday, above all. Taehyung isn\u2019t the biggest fan of running, that\u2019s all. Goddamn Hoseok and all his voluntary work. No, scratch that. Voluntary work was great, overall, but why did it have to involve _running_ of all things? \u201cHe\u00a0has to stop trying to impress Namjoon,\u201d he declares as soon as he steps in the kitchen, where Jungkook waits, playing some game on his smartphone. \u201cHm? Isn\u2019t Joon and Jimin a thing?\u201d  \u201cWhat? !\u201d  \u201cYeah, I thought everyone knew?\u201d  \u201cHow did _you_ find that out?\u201d  \u201c..", "is_question": false}}

That\u2019s just absurd. Yeah, they\u2019re all pretty cute, yes, but dating? A relationship? It just sounds\u2026 No, Taehyung can\u2019t see that. _Wait._ But what about Jungkook? \u201cSo\u2026\u201d He starts, instantly earning a glare from Jungkook. In turn, he apparently dies in the game he was playing, so Taehyung gets more than two seconds of his attention. \u201cHave _you_ got your eyes on anyone?\u201d  Jungkook coughs like he\u2019s choked on something, perhaps air. \u201cWhat?\u201d  \u201cEveryone\u2019s dating or something, apparently. I thought you might\u2019ve been, too?\u201d  \u201cNo. _No,_ \u201d Jungkook repeats, with extra emphasis. \u201cNot dating?\u201d  \u201cNo.\u201d  \u201cNot even any crushes?\u201d  \u201cWe should get going.\u201d  \u201cOh?\u201d He looks down at his bowl, finding it still half-full. \u201cBut I\u2019m not finished. Koo-\u201d  He drinks it in a hurry, praying it won\u2019t be too bad for his stomach, and rushes to the front door where Jungkook awaits still looking flustered. Or mad, because they\u2019re late? Or both. The marathon isn\u2019t too far, but they need to catch a bus first. Still, they\u2019re pretty on time\u2014Hoseok compliments their punctuality and Taehyung raises an eyebrow at Jungkook, who simply ignores him. It\u2019s not as bad as it seemed to be now that they\u2019re here. It\u2019s a nice day, not cold but not hot either, and of Taehyung manages to take it easy, he\u2019s positive he can reach the finish line. He does the stretching carefully, with Jungkook\u2019s help. Jungkook is probably ending the marathon in first place, the way he\u2019s always exercising around the apartment and going out for night or morning runs at ass o\u2019clock. He even looks like a natural, like he\u2019s a part of this environment instead of one of the people brought by a friend. He goes around helping everyone he can, morning sunlight hitting the most prominent features of his face and catching Taehyung\u2019s eyes. Taehyung squints, but doesn\u2019t look away. \u2b52\u2b51\u2b52\u2b51\u2b52  \u201cSee, it wasn\u2019t that bad, was it?\u201d  Taehyung looks up from the concrete where he\u2019s flat out lying. Jungkook is sitting at the sidewalk by his side, smiling from ear to ear like he\u2019s not anywhere close to imminent death. \u201cMy legs were burning, Jungkook. _Burning._ And I\u2019m not exaggerating.\u201d  His hair is dripping sweat, and it shouldn\u2019t be _cute_ , but it\u2019s Jungkook. \u201cBut you did it! Imagine if you had some practice.\u201d  Taehyung lets out a weak snarl, lacking any bite to it. \u201cI\u2019d rather just keep watching you doing your routines around the house, thanks.\u201d  If Jungkook blushes, it\u2019s well hidden by the exercising blush that\u2019s still there. \u201cC\u2019mon, Tae. It was way better running along with you than it is running by myself every day. I\u2019ll keep up with you, and we don\u2019t have to go every day. _Please._ \u201d  That\u2019s true. Jungkook had kept his pace throughout the whole marathon, and that was probably why Taehyung had actually crossed the finish line. It was just impossible to resist Jungkook\u2019s puppy eyes. It was a trap all along, and Taehyung should have known it. \u201cFine.\u201d  Jungkook\u2019s face lights up instantly, and Taehyung almost feels good with himself for being the cause for his euphoria. A blond drops by Jungkook\u2019s side at the crosswalk, offering Taehyung a cold water bottle. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t even that hard.\u201d  And, truly, he\u2019s barely breaking any sweat. In fact, Yoongi looks almost _exactly_ like he did right before the marathon. Jungkook only chuckles by his side, and something clicks inside Taehyung\u2019s head. \u201cBastard. You called a taxi, didn\u2019t you?\u201d  Yoongi feigns innocence and utter bafflement. \u201cI would _never_ think of something like that.\u201d \t8. Chapter 8  The one thing Jungkook always tried to avoid was a matter of principle. Borrowing clothes from Taehyung was completely out of line. Because he had feelings Taehyung wasn\u2019t aware of, and he could never wear even a t-shirt from Taehyung without feeling stupidly giddy about it. This self-imposed rule only made him really good at having a tight schedule for their laundries. However. The weather was something Jungkook couldn\u2019t control just yet, and walking around the apartment without a t-shirt? That is fine. Going out in the cold weather without a hoodie? Well, that\u2019s just not as fine. Luckily, Jungkook wouldn\u2019t have to leave the house before his hoodies were all dry and ready to go, because it was still Sunday. \u201cOkay, we have like\u2026 six clothing items, together.\u201d Taehyung states, scientifically. \u201cI\u2019ll just stay under the blankets the whole day.\u201d  Taehyung chuckles, leaning into him. It makes everything inside Jungkook lights up, but he does his best to remain still. \u201cDon\u2019t be dumb, you should wear this.\u201d   And maybe it\u2019s because the specific item of clothing is so unexpected that Jungkook\u2019s brain comes to a halt, but he can\u2019t deny it. He ends up promptly accepting the pastel yellow crop top (crop top???) with long sleeves and then it\u2019s too late to deny it. Taehyung is happily singsonging to his favorite song (at the moment) and waltzing away from the laundry room, and Jungkook tries the crop top on  _ just because. _ It has their laundry\u2019s smell, after all, it shouldn\u2019t be that dangerous. \u2026 Except for the fact that he can\u2019t stop imagining Taehyung wearing this exact piece of clothing. When? In which context? Why hadn\u2019t Jungkook heard  _ anything  _ about this? They literally _ lived together. _  He can t deny the clothing item is fairly comfortable, and wearing nothing isn\u2019t exactly appalling when it\u2019s almost snowing outside. Even when their heating system is working just fine. Surely, Taehyung is waiting under Jungkook\u2019s blankets, like there isn\u2019t anywhere else for him to be on a Sunday afternoon, and it\u2019s some kind of high that Jungkook gets from seeing Taehyung\u2019s blatant stare, looking him up and down, and then suddenly standing up and rushing out of the bedroom, cheeks red and eyes avoiding him. \u201cI just remembered I haven\u2019t eaten anything today.\u201d  \u201cWe\u2019ve literally just had lunch, what are you talking about?\u201d Jungkook closes the door behind him, dragging Taehyung back to his bed. \u201cAre we watching something?\u201d  And suddenly Taehyung is back to his usual self, scrambling back to bed and picking Jungkook\u2019s laptop. \u201cThere\u2019s a new episode of-\u201d  That\u2019s how they go \u2018til seven p.m., Taehyung tickling the expanse of exposed skin under the blankets every single time Jungkook threatened to fall asleep. When their group chat with\u00a0their friends from work decides to come back to life talking about dinner (? ), Taehyung jumps out of bed and runs to the laundry again, rummaging through their laundry, more clothes dry than before, and for some reason, Jungkook gets to wear his own clothes again, but Taehyung needs a hoodie. And all Taehyung\u2019s hoodies are either wet or dirty. So. \u201cMines are finally dry,\u201d Jungkoook offers, in exchange for the crop top offer earlier. \u201cLook, it was an unexpected change of weather, we couldn\u2019t have known,\u201d Taehyung says, already wearing Jungkook\u2019s jacket, not sure about what he\u2019s even accepting, only worried about not catching a cold. \u201cYeah,\u201d Jungkook agrees, reluctantly. But there\u2019s not much he can do. His selfish feelings have absolutely nothing to do with this. \u2b52\u2b51\u2b52\u2b51\u2b52  Namjoon saw them getting in the restaurant and gasps when he sees what Taehyung is wearing because there, at Taehyung\u2019s back, is Jungkook\u2019s name. Printed on fabric. Everyone is shellshocked, and then Seokjin says, \u201cCongrats on the relationship update! !\u201d  Jungkook looked confused and even more so Taehyung, even from afar, but their friends were just happy. They come to their table and greet everyone, Jungkook getting redder by the second. \u201cFucking finally,\u201d Jimin says, making space for them right by his side. \u201cWe can order now.\u201d  \u201cIt was about time,\u201d Hoseok says, winking Jungkook\u2019s way. Taehyung looks from Hoseok to Jungkook, and the later avoids him. \u201cTo order food?\u201d  \u201cYeah, sure,\u201d Hoseok winks again, and Taehyung looks like he\u2019s about to lose it. They choose a meal course to share, neither of them super hungry but both wanting extra fries, and even though that\u2019s usual, every single person on their table sighs, calling them disgusting,  _ of fucking course they\u2019re gonna share. _ And that\u2019s when Taehyung loses it. He stands up, shouting \u201cRestroom!\u201d and dragging Jungkook along with him. \u201cWhy does everyone seem to think that we\u2019re dating now?\u201d  Jungkook hides further inside his hoodie. \u201cIt\u2019s the jacket. The one I lent you.\u201d  \u201cWhat about it? I mean, what if they know it\u2019s yours, what does it have to do with\u2026\u201d  \u201cHmm, it\u2019s my university\u2019s varsity jacket.\u201d  Taehyung looks right into his eyes, in complete silence. \u201cOh.\u201d  \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I just- you needed something, and it was dry, and-\u201d  \u201cYou let me borrow your varsity jacket! That\u2019s so cute. _ Cutie. _ It\u2019s an honor, I can\u2019t believe it. I need a mirror, might snap some pics since we\u2019re here, I\u2019m wearing your varsity fucking jacket oh my god-\u201d  Jungkook is caught between dying and punching Taehyung, so he obviously only groans instead. \u201cTaehyung\u2026\u201d  \u201cYeah, join the photo, come here!\u201d  He ceases resisting Taehyung\u2019s shenanigans and just enjoys the moment. He deserves it, Taehyung being ridiculous and posing a hundred different ways to show off Jungkook\u2019s jacket is something he should be enjoying to the fullest. Christ. If Taehyung knew he could have that damn jacket for all eternity if he wanted, that Jungkook was _ so fucking there for this,  _ that this is literally his wildest fucking dream come alive. Taehyung obliviously poses with his back turned to the mirror, hand resting on Jungkook\u2019s left shoulder, their chests almost pressed together, and it takes everything inside him not to embrace Taehyung\u2019s waist on a hug and sink his face on Taehyung\u2019s neck, hiding how flustered he is, but also how content he feels. Something changes right there and then, and Jungkook mentally sighs. This is why there was a rule, and he should have never borrowed any piece of clothing from Taehyung. He was still wearing the yellow crop top under his hoodie, even though it wasn't to show off, it was there, and he knew it, and that was why he was wearing it, despite whatever Taehyung thought it was. Now, there was  _ no  _ turning back.", "is_question": false}}

Day 1    The medal felt heavy on her neck, but the weight of the situation she found herself in weighted more. She tried to smile looking at her training partner on her side, Alina was wearing the gold medal, she had been wearing the gold medal in every competition the last couple of months & although she wanted to be happy for her, she couldn\u2019t help but think in how this would affect her future. Just in their training team with Eteri they had two young girls doing quads, she couldn\u2019t even perfect the triple lutz, how she was going to manage to get to that level in the years to come. \u201cSilver medal is a big achievement\u201d, she tried to tell herself, but the truth is that it felt like a death sentence. It felt like the ending of an unsatisfying journey, she knew the reality of her country in her field, everyday there was a new girl, training as hard as her, younger & better than her. She felt like an used car just waiting to be discarded. An old model who knew her time was up. She had been dedicating her whole life to a sport just to lose it in a matter of minutes, she wanted to be hopeful, to have faith in herself but her last year as a senior was taking a toll on her. She was not only physically exhausted, but also mentally and emotionally tired, \u201cand the season hasn\u2019t even ended yet\u201d, she reminded herself. She still had the Worlds to focus on & she wasn\u2019t sure she could beat Alina there, she wasn\u2019t sure if she would be able to beat her ever again, that\u2019s how crushed she felt. While the anthem of the Olympics played, she saw Eteri from a distance looking at her & Alina, she had a calm expression on her face, saving her thoughts to herself about their results. Eteri had been her coach since she was 6 & although she was friends with her mom & a mentor to her, she never played favourites, she had to earn her respect with every training & every performance. But she knew that now that she lost 2 competitions in a row to Alina, things weren\u2019t looking good for her, especially because soon her competition was going to be tougher with Anna (Scherbakova) & Alexandra (Trusova) close to making their senior debuts. After the medal ceremony ended at Pyeong Chang, Evgenia returned quickly to Eteri\u2019s side while Alina walked slowly behind her. They had to start getting ready for the gala, if she was honest with herself, she didn\u2019t want to participate, she just wanted to be alone, maybe put some ice on her foot that was still not completely healed. She wished she could sleep until the end of the season, if she won gold she could afford to miss the Worlds, but she didn\u2019t, so she had to work hard to maintain herself relevant. But would it be worth it? In two to three years she would have to compete with little girls who could do quads in their sleep. The future look depressing whenever she thought about it. While returning to their hotel to change for practices, Evgenia put on her headphones to avoid interacting with anyone, both Alina & Eteri had been quiet after the ceremony, but that wasn\u2019t rare, Alina was a quiet girl by nature & Eteri wasn\u2019t that talkative either, only during practice she was blunt, after that she only talked when necessary. Normally, she would take on the job of filling the silence, but today she didn\u2019t want to talk, she just wanted to sulk & listen to some music. So she got lost in the music of EXO & closed her eyes. Two hours later they were at the rink, getting ready to practice their exhibition numbers, Evgenia was getting ready to hit the ice when Eteri stopped her. -\u201cAlina is going first today\u201d, she said softly but sternly. Evgenia looked at her atonished before asking why. Eteri simply said, \u201cyou know why\u201d, before walking to Alina\u2019s side to give her some instructions. Evgenia waited outside the rink while Alina worked with Eteri on her \u201cAfro Blue\u201d exhibition number, but she wasn\u2019t looking at Alina, instead she was going through the steps of her program on her mind, remembering each step, trying to analyze how to make her program more complex so it could be more competitive. This was her life, one competition at a time, a whole life dedicated to a sport so it could be reduced to 4 minutes of the world watching & judging. When it was her turn & she stepped to the ice, she closed her eyes to get ready for the same program she had at the exhibitions of the European Championships, it was going to be \u201cKukushka\u201d, the song that represented her journey, the song that represented how she felt at that moment. She tried to put everything behind her, \u201cdon\u2019t look back\u201d she said to herself, she opened her eyes & started everything again. \t2. Day 2    When she opened her eyes, she knew she didn\u2019t felt ready for a new day, the day before it had been the medal ceremony & also her first day of practice for the Exhibition Gala of the Olympics. She practiced with all her heart, she jumped until her legs felt numb because she wanted to tire her body, she wanted to feel tired enough to quiet the doubts of her mind, so she could sleep in peace, so she didn\u2019t fear the uncertainty of her future. The alarm of her cellphone went off at that second reminding her she only had 30 minutes to get ready. They had to leave in one hour to the main rink at Gangneung to practice with the rest of the athletes for their group number at the Gala. This put a smile on her face, she was going to see Misha & Yuzuru there, it still broke her heart that Wakaba wasn\u2019t able to make it to the Olympics, she could have used one of her hugs right now. Checking the clock on her cellphone she realized she lost too much time lost in her thoughts, so she quickly left her bed to start her day. Two hours later she couldn\u2019t stop smiling watching everyone enjoying the practice for the Gala. Everyone at the rink was in a good mood, no one thought about what was going to happen in their futures after the Olympics, they stopped thinking about their falls & mistakes, about the ones who would retire after the Gala, at that moment they were all kids at the playground & that playground was the ice. Just like her, everyone at the rink had dedicated their lives to this sport, to this dream & at that moment she felt ashamed of herself, for not feeling it was enough. Just being here it was a dream, how many girls wanted to be in her position, Wakaba herself couldn\u2019t get a spot on her team, so what if she didn\u2019t win gold, she gave her all. \u201cBut my all wasn\u2019t enough\u201d whispered the doubts on her mind. Today it wasn\u2019t about thinking about her failures, today she was going to enjoy the moment, so she put a smile on her face, the same smile that didn\u2019t reach her heart, but it didn\u2019t matter, because even if she felt empty inside, she was going to enjoy this day, she was going to create memories she would treasure for the rest of her life. -\u201cDo you want to do a jump competition?\u201d asked a playful voice next to her, distracting her from her thoughts. She turned her head to see Misha smiling at her & she laughed before joining his playful mood to say   \\- \u201cI don\u2019t know, I don\u2019t want you to get hurt, we all know joints start to ache at 26\u201d. He laughed before continuing their game   \\- \u201cAre you calling me old Medvedeva\u201d. She put on her best poker face before saying   -\u201cSo it\u2019s not only your joints that hurt, you\u2019re also bad at hearing, I feel so sorry for you Misha\u201d. Immediately after saying that, she felt his hands on her hips & she felt her weight leaving the ice before she realized Misha was carrying her & laughing loudly. -\u201cPut me down Misha\u201d she said a little bit scared. \\- \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I had a big breakfast, so I\u2019m still strong\u201d he said with a smile. -\u201cAre you guys going to try pair figure skating now?\u201d asked a voice next to them, that belonged to the Yuzuru Hanyu, someone Evgenia still couldn\u2019t believe she was able to call a friend. -\u201cWhy, are you jealous?\u201d asked Misha, \u201cdon\u2019t believe I forgot how Ondrej (Hotarek) carried you yesterday\u201d, he said joking, while carefully putting Evgenia back on the ice. \\- \u201cOndrej carried this kid?\u201d asked Zhenya with a smile. -\u201cEverybody wants to carry me because I\u2019m cute\u201d joked Yuzuru. \\- \u201cI always knew that Ondrej was one of your fangirls\u201d teased Evgenia. \\- \u201cMaybe he would get you a new Pooh bear\u201d said Misha, joining Evgenia on her teasing. Yuzuru just laughed as he always did & Evgenia couldn\u2019t help but think how lucky she was to be able to share this kind of moments with them. \u201cTreasure this moments because they are not going to last\u201d, said the treacherous voice on her head, but she refused to listen, not today, she said to herself. \u201cToday my fears are not going to take over\u201d, she repeated as a mantra on her mind. So to quiet her doubts, she skated close to Yuzuru & Misha and asked \u201cso, are you ready for this jump competition?\u201d. \t3. Day 3    The night of the Gala felt like a pause on her life. Like time had stop over to give her a break. She walked around backstage excited of seeing everyone while they got ready. It was strange to not feel nerves, but tonight it wasn\u2019t a competition, tonight it was about enjoying the ice. Performing was what she had done through her whole life, bringing joy to people through her hardwork it was an indescribable feeling, a feeling she didn\u2019t want to give up. -\u201cYou look happy\u201d said a voice behind her. She turned & saw Yuzuru looking at her. He had a smile on his face, because Yuzuru without a smile wasn\u2019t the Yuzuru she knew. -\u201cI\u2019m happy to see everyone happy\u201d she said a little bit shyly, she always felt timid when she was alone with Yuzuru, it was easier when Misha was around, but being alone with him made her nervous. -\u201cI like your outfit\u201d he said, before picking her hood & putting it on her head. \\- \u201cWe can exchange outfits if you want\u201d she said smiling while putting her hood back in its place, \u201cI\u2019m sure the feathers would suit me better than you\u201d. \\- \u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d he answered, \u201cno one is as badass as you\u201d. Evgenia stayed silent because she didn\u2019t know how to answer. It was easy to go for the joke, but when he was earnest, he destroyed all of her walls. -\u201cI wanted to congratulate you\u201d he said softly, taking a step closer to her. \\- \u201cFor what\u201d she asked quietly. \\- \u201cGetting silver of course\u201d he said gently & she felt the understanding on his voice. -\u201cThank you\u201d she said while looking at the floor \u201cbut you\u2019re the one that should get all the praises, two golds is not a small feature Yuzuru\u201d. -\u201cYou don\u2019t have to pretend\u201d he said in a whisper & she felt the air leaving her lungs as if someone had punched her. \u201cI know it\u2019s hard, what you did that day, it\u2019s worth more than a medal, you\u2019re a champion Zhenya, never forget it\u201d he said carefully. She looked up not caring anymore he would see the tears in her eyes & she saw the surprise on his face when she went for a hug. -\u201cI\u2019m sorry\u201d she said softly in his arms, she tried to let go because she had acted on impulse, but she felt him hugging her even tighter. \\- \u201cDon\u2019t apologize, we all need a hug sometimes\u201d he told her gently finally letting go. -\u201cI know those hugs are exclusive for Pooh-san\u201d she joked while wiping the tears from her eyes. -\u201cHe told me he can share the hugs with you & with Luna-chan\u201d he told her in a voice that warmed her heart, she was no match for him, her heart ran wild & beat harder than ever, so she said in a whisper \u201cI think I\u2019m ok with that\u201d. During the rest of the evening she could feel the eyes of Yuzuru following her at times, she knew she surprised him with the hug. They have hugged before but this was different because this time it felt like he was consoling her, so it felt more intimate. She tried to calm herself as she always did, with skating, she started going back on the steps for her program on her mind, she repeated the choreography on loop on her memory while listening to Kukushka on her ipod. She usually listened to Exo before the competitions but tonight she wasn\u2019t competing, she wasn\u2019t even performing, because she wasn\u2019t planning to portray anyone but herself through her program, she was going to express something she couldn\u2019t put into words, something she felt in her heart. This is what skating was for her, not only the sport that she dedicated her life to, but also the place where she could be herself. Even when she played a character there was always a little bit of herself in every show, in every step, in every turn & in every jump. Tonight, her heart was going to stay on the ice. She stayed close to the rink when Gabriella & Guillaume took the ice. She had been watching everyone\u2019s program, from Javier\u2019s fun \u201cAerobic class\u201d to the romantic performance of Han & Sui with \u201cRun\u201d. She wanted to take it all, because this moment with everyone relaxing & smiling was rare, in less than a month they had to be in Milan for the World Championships & she wasn\u2019t looking forward to it. This would be the last day to relax before she started training for her next competition. That had been her routine for the last four years, competitions during the winter & fall seasons and shows & training through the summer. Time passed by, people changed but ice was always there, as a permanent feature on her life. As she saw Gabriella & Guillaume finish their performance to \u201cPray you catch me\u201d she got ready to be next. It was always difficult to get back to perform for an audience after a disappointing result in competition, especially when it was an exhibition that relied more in engaging the audience than just concentrating in the technical side of her program. Luckily, she didn\u2019t have to smile or be flirty for \u201cKukushka\u201d, the dark themes of the song suited the state of her soul at the moment, so it was easy to get lost in the tempo of the song. She skated slowly to the center of the rink after Gabriella & Guillaume left the ice, she could see the flashes, hear the announcer calling her name, she could feel the eyes of every person in the arena, but at that moment she erased them all. This was not a performance for them, this was for herself. To remind herself why she still dedicated her life to this profession, why even after the biggest disappointment in her life she couldn\u2019t imagine doing anything else but going back to what she knew. This was who she is & this was what she wanted to continue doing for as long as she could. She closed her eyes & when she heard the first notes of the song, she felt ready to tell a story through her art again. \t4. Day 15    She could feel every muscle in her body ache at the end of her practice, she had one more week to train before the World Figure Skating Championship started & her goal of revalidating her gold medal there seemed to be more far away than ever", "is_question": false}}

She skated slowly to the end of the rink where she was standing to hear the reviews of her training. -\u201cYour landings are off\u201d she said severely, \u201cif you don\u2019t have secure landings, you cannot do the combinations\u201d, she reminded her. \u201cYou need to stay later tomorrow to practice if you want to catch up to Alina\u201d, she said sternly before turning & walking down to her office. This was common with Eteri, always pointing down the mistakes, but never praising her skaters when things went well, she should be used by now, but sometimes she wished she could get a word of encouragement. She turned to the ice & saw Alina leaving the rink quietly. -\u201cAre you alright?\u201d asked Alina as soon as she reached her. -\u201cYes, thank you. I\u2019m just tired\u201d, answered Zhenya before walking to the dressing rooms to pick her things so she could go home. As she left the gym, she saw her mom\u2019s car in the parking lot. She always made time to take her to trainings & pick her up everyday, that\u2019s why she felt she had no right to complain. Her mom had already sacrificed enough to make her dreams come true, so the least she could do is to deliver in what has become the dream of both of them. -\u201dHey honey, how was practice?\u201d, her mom asked as soon as she got in the car. -\u201cIt was good, I feel I\u2019m improving\u201d she said without looking at her mom in the eyes while pretending to be busy with her phone. That was a bad habit she had, everytime she felt she couldn\u2019t be honest, she looked at the floor or anywhere else to avoid the eyes of the person she couldn't be sincere to. Wakaba once told her that the expressiveness of her face was her biggest curse but also her biggest weapon. On the ice it was a great help when she needed to portray a character, but on real life it presented a problem because it meant anyone could read her like a book. -\u201cEteri called me this morning\u201d said her mom, taking her out of her thoughts. -\u201cWhy?\u201d, she asked softly, fearing her answer   -\u201cShe told me you are having problems with your landings & she\u2019s worried\u201d, she told her while starting the car   Evgenia didn\u2019t answer, didn\u2019t confirm her mom\u2019s suspicions because if she vocalized her fears, she knew she would crumble, so she stayed silent until her mom spoke again. -\u201cEteri said that there are only two reasons this could be happening & let\u2019s hope it\u2019s not the worst case scenario\u201d she told her in a tone that worried her   -\u201cwhat is the worst case scenario?\u201d, she asked with fear   -\u201cSkaters start to lose precision & flexibility with age, you\u2019re getting older so it\u2019s normal you cannot jump as easily as other skaters younger than you, the problem is that this would mean you already reached your peak\u201d she said in a straight tone. When her mom put the facts so bluntly she really hated to be the daughter of a former figure skater, if her mom had been just a housewife like Alina\u2019s grandmother maybe she could be more supportive. But that wasn\u2019t the nature of her mom, she always went straight to the point, which might be the reason why she was close with Eteri, they were both painfully frank. -\u201cwhat is the best case scenario?\u201d she asked hopefully   -\u201cthat you might be injured\u201d she answered candidly. Evgenia felt the tears in her eyes, but held it together & simply said   -\u201cthen let\u2019s hope for the best case scenario\u201d before putting on her headphones on & staying silent until they reached home. As soon as she reached the apartment she shared with her mom, she took her shoes off & started walking to her bedroom but the voice of her mother made her stop   -\u201cYou don\u2019t want dinner?\u201d her mom asked while closing the door of their home. -\u201cYou know I can\u2019t eat after 6, least of all so close to competition\u201d, she answered dryly before continuing her way to her bedroom. As soon as she arrived to her destination, she saw a small package on her bed & while picking up the small gift she saw a simple note that said \u201cTo Zhenya-chan\u201d. When she opened carefully the wrapping paper she saw that inside there was a cute necklace of a moon & next to it a note that said   \u201cThis is your belated Olympic gift, you\u2019re always gold in our hearts, gambatte Zhenya-chan! With love   M & Y\u201d   She smiled to herself & immediately reached for her phone to write to her boys. When the world looked bleak they always put a smile on her face, this was a reminder of what she held dear, after this there was only one way, she was going to fight for a chance. \t5. Day 24    It was loud on the arena, louder than any normal competition, because this wasn\u2019t any normal competition, this was the World\u2019s Championship. After the Olympics, this was the biggest accomplishment any athlete on her field could get. She had already won it twice & she should be relaxed at this stage by now, but this year, after everything than unraveled, this felt like a test. Is this the end of Evgenia Medvedeva? That\u2019s the question everyone in the media was asking. If she lost, it not only reinforced the idea that Alina had come to take her place, but also it would erase what she accomplished, she would be another story to add to the older figure skater losing her place to someone younger narrative. Maybe Eteri was right & she already reached her peak before the Olympics. For two years, she was on the top of her field, but not anymore & although she was still in the podium she knew it was just a matter of time until one of the juniors of her country became a senior & started making things more complicated for her with quads. She made sure to avoid the media while getting ready for the World\u2019s, she didn\u2019t want anything to distract her from her training, but everyday Eteri informed her of new requests for interviews with Alina. The media was enjoying their rivalry & with Yuzuru not participating at the World Championship, the media made sure to hype the battle of the Russian Ladies as much as they could. But that wasn\u2019t what worried her, but the lack of stability she had been showing during the practice of her jumps. She had tried to convince Eteri to allow her to backload her jumps to catch up to Alina, but she had the last word & she told her that as long as she wasn\u2019t having clean landings, she would continue doing three of her jumps before the second half. She also took out the triple lutz, triple loop combination she had been practicing for her program, which meant that just in technical, she was already several points behind Alina. It seemed like only a miracle could help her retain the title. She took a deep breath & started her routine backstage, practicing her jumps while Exo played in her ipod. This felt like a chronicle of a death foretold, she knew the scores even before she stepped on the ice, she never felt as defeated as today. She saw the girls on her group practicing as she did, Satoko (Miyahara) warmed up flexing her legs while Kaetlyn (Osmond) ran from one corner of the room to the other & Alina practiced her spins in the floor. They all looked focus & ready, while she felt more lost than ever, she tried to put on a brave face but she knew what she was going to be facing, after all she had been seeing Alina\u2019s routine for the last three weeks, while practicing next to her for the World\u2019s Championship. \\- \u201cWhat is the mark of a true champion?\u201d, she remembered the question that Tatyana Tarasova asked her the first time she became a World Champion. That time she answered, \u201cthe way they deal with success\u201d, but Tatyana simply said \u201cNo, my girl. It\u2019s how they face adversity\u201d. Now, she finally understood the depth of her words. Because for two years, she only knew success & maybe during that time she wasn\u2019t a true champion, because her biggest competition was herself. But now, she wasn\u2019t the one leading the group, instead she was the one that had to catch up. And she knew she only had two options, either fight with all her might or settle & be one of the many, another Russian name that would get lost in obscurity after being replaced by a younger skater. Alina would take her place and then someone younger than Alina would come & the cycle would continue. But she refused to be another disposable name in history, she refused to accept her sacrifices meant nothing to her future, she didn\u2019t want her dream to end when it hadn\u2019t even started. So when she heard one of the officials of the event announce to them that they were going to be next on the presentation of the short program, she knew she had to make a choice. And while all the girls started to put on their skates to get ready to hit the ice, she started thinking about the possibilities of the risky decision that she was about to take. And when she finished tying her laces, she held her moon necklace for strength because she knew she had reached one of the most difficult decisions of her life. \t6. Day 30    The season was over for her, \u201cit couldn\u2019t have ended in a worst note\u201d, she thought while she walked Jerry to the park. Summer was near & while she usually looked forward to practice fun routines for the summer shows & catch up with all the animes she missed during the season, this summer felt drearier than ever. For the first time in two years she had missed the podium, she couldn\u2019t even get bronze & this was her own fault. \u201cI knew it was going to be risky\u201d she said to herself. Her last-minute decision to backload all of her jumps didn\u2019t pay off, her foot was still recovering & her stamina didn\u2019t match Alina\u2019s so she fell in her triple Salchow triple toe loop combination. She also got lower GOEs than usual on her jumps, because her landings kept getting sloppier & to top it all, Eteri was mad at her. She didn\u2019t like her decision of changing her program content without consulting her & even when she managed to make it up in the free program following their original script, it wasn\u2019t enough & she ended up being fourth. She knew she was in trouble when Eteri didn\u2019t sat with her at the Kiss & Cry when her results were shown. And she was paying it now, because Eteri had demoted her to train under Sergei (Dudakov), who worked as her right hand on the Training Center. Eteri only managed the top students, so at the moment her main focus was Alina, while she had to raise to the ranks again if she wanted to be considered. Not that it matter, because her last checkup with her doctor shown that she couldn\u2019t train for a month. Her foot was still recovering & all the competitions she had been participating lately, delayed her rehabilitation process. So, she had to sit for the rest of the season & concentrate in getting better, at least that\u2019s what the doctor said. But could she afford to sit & recover? Because that tactic wasn\u2019t working for Adelina (Sotnikova), who was rumored to be retiring soon. Yulia (Lipnitskaya) had already retired & she seemed to be going into coaching. \u201cBut at least they got gold\u201d, her doubts murmured in her head. What did she have? She was just a fading star, one that was dying before she actually had the opportunity to shine. A sudden vibration took her out of her thoughts as she saw a new message on her phone. It was from Misha, since the World Championship ended, Yuzuru, Misha & Wakaba had been her main support, sending her funny messages so she could cheer up. Today, it was a Ryan Gosling meme that said \u201chey girl, the only thing more marvelous than my abs is your smile\u201d. She smiled at his silly joke & only wrote on the group chat she had with her boys   -\u201cHow do you always know how to cheer me up Misha?\u201d   He only answered with another meme, this time it was an image of Yuzuru shirtless with the words   -\u201cHey girl, keep that smile on, or I\u2019ll put my shirt back on\u201d   She laughed this time, and before she could answer she saw that Yuzuru was writing something too   -\u201cYou guys know that I can read everything you write, right?\u201d   Misha wrote back   -\u201cLook at the bright side, your shirtless picture made Janny laugh. Now the question is, if she\u2019s laughing because she\u2019s not impressed by your abs, or because my joke was that funny\u201d   Evgenia joined the banter by writing   -\u201cCouldn\u2019t it be the two options?\u201d   Misha continued   -\u201cDon\u2019t be mean to Yuzu, Janny. Remember that he has an army of fans that can hunt you down\u201d   Evgenia simply answered   -\u201cI know, I\u2019m always afraid I would be attacked by a group of girls holding Pooh bears\u201d   Misha quickly wrote   -\u201cThat\u2019s the nightmare of every girl that interacts with Yuzu for more than 10 seconds\u201d   Yuzuru joined their game & he simply put   \u201cDon\u2019t worry Zhenya, you know that as a Sailor Soldier your powers would prevent the attack of any Pooh bear in your vicinity. And if all you needed to cheer up was a picture of abs, here is a picture of me & Misha shirtless\u201d   When Evgenia saw the picture, she couldn\u2019t stop laughing, because for once Yuzu wasn\u2019t the bottom of the jokes & he finally paid back Misha\u2019s constant teasing. While she wiped the laughing tears from her eyes, she realized that this was the reason she would never regret getting into figure skating. Regardless of her results, what she would take with her wasn\u2019t only the memories of her triumphs, but also the friends she made thanks to this profession. With that thought on her mind, she set up to make a meme of her own to make her boys smile, at that moment she felt that sense of happiness for being able to enjoy the little things in life, she felt the smell of the beginning of summer reaching her & bringing her hope that maybe her journey wasn\u2019t over. And if it was, what a ride it was. \t7. Day 50    Getting back on the ice after sustaining a long-term injury was never easy. It had been almost a month since she last came to train & from her last check-up things seemed better with her foot. Of course, the doctor said to avoid doing triples at least for two more weeks, but she could return to the ice to do some step sequences. Sergei watched her from a corner following her every move & checking her speed to review her motions later on. Before she stepped on the ice, they had discussed what type of music she was thinking for the new season. During her time away from the rink, that\u2019s all she was thinking, what she could do to restore her position and what type of music would suit her comeback. She had settle on \u201cCoppelia: Act I \u2013 Valse\u201d for her free skate program & \u201cPulcinella suite: VIIIb. Finale. Allegro assai\u201d for her short program. Sergei seemed satisfied with her choices & he told her she would need extra training this summer to be able to backload her jumps as she wanted. She was happy with those news, because it meant she was going to be able to face Alina in the same conditions, but it also meant she would have to train extra hard to be able to have enough stamina to keep all of her jumps at the end of her program. When she finished her practice, Sergei pointed out that she was still a little bit stiff on the ice, but that was normal considering she had stopped training for several weeks. He also told her about some of the offers she had for the summer shows, including Dreams on Ice in Japan again", "is_question": false}}

She already had a song on mind for that show, it was a song she wanted to use for one of her competition programs, but she wouldn\u2019t be able to use it because she had to use ballet songs if she wanted to compete with Alina, because those songs suited better the programs when there was backloading involved. As she left the gym she saw Alina arriving to the Training Center. Now that it was the beginning of summer & she was working with Sergei, she didn\u2019t see Alina as often as before, because they weren\u2019t working together anymore. She waved to Alina from a distance who waved back, but continued her way into the gym without stopping, she knew why. Eteri didn\u2019t like when her students were late & she knew how harder trainings got when she was in a bad mood, so she didn\u2019t blame her. Today, her mom didn\u2019t pick her up from training because she was busy with some errands, and she was planning to ask her to stop bringing her to the gym in the mornings as well. During her time away from the rink she had started to think about asking her mom to keep her distance from her training, maybe if she stopped getting involved with her figure skating, they could have a more normal mother/ daughter relationship, because right now she felt more like a second coach than a mother. The problem is that she didn\u2019t know how to bring the topic to conversation without hurting her mom\u2019s feelings, she knew that making her successful in figure skating had become their joined goal, but right now at her lowest, she didn\u2019t need someone else pushing her harder to get back on shape, she just needed unconditional support, in other words she needed her mom. While waiting to take the subway back home, she saw a guy wearing the best shirt she ever saw & at that moment she wished Yuzuru was with her because he would be the only one else who could understand the joke. But they lived in opposites sides of the world, so she settled for sharing her discovery with him. Carefully she took her cellphone out of her bag & while pretending to write a message, she subtly took a picture of the shirt of the guy, and smiled to herself while she admired the treasure she found. After zooming the picture and checking that the numbers on the shirt were clear, she sent a message to the group chat she had with Yuzuru & Misha. She couldn\u2019t wait for Yuzu to see the picture & maybe give back to him a little bit of the happiness he gave her while he was trying to cheer her up. At that moment the train stopped on the station & she went inside while putting on her headphones, because today \u201cUnravel\u201d would be the soundtrack that would guide her way back home.", "is_question": false}}

Prologue (1)  ** Timeline: **  ** SH: Post-Reichenbach, but does not follow series 3. **  ** MCU: Post-Civil War **  ** Ships: None **  ** Please enjoy! **  Patiently waiting for a case had paid off, because it wasn't long before Lestrade was on the threshold of 221B asking for Sherlock's help in a case. The scene of the death wasn't far so it took a short cab ride of a few minutes for the three of them to get there and the consulting detective was instantly all over the scene before they'd even entered the building. After throwing a few quick insults at Anderson and Donovan, Sherlock led the group headed into the building, up the stairs, and onto the crime scene. As soon as the genius saw the body he got to work, crouching down and examining all possibilities. The DI and the blogger watched on as Sherlock worked intently. The victim had to have been underage, which made the whole situation a bit more solemn. She was lying on her back with her limbs sprawled out, eyes shut peacefully. The teen wore a white\u00a0 _Shakespeare's Globe Theatre_ \u00a0t-shirt and maroon gym shorts with the words\u00a0 _Pygone High School_ \u00a0on the left pant-leg. Sherlock's eyes processed her clothing then moved on to the clunky metal bracelet she wore. \"Well?\" Lestrade questioned. \"This is definitely worth calling me in for,\" the genius quickly replied, going over the conditions of her skin. Lestrade ran a hand over his face. \"Which means it's stranger than I initially thought. Great.\" John couldn't help but crack a smile. Sherlock gave the body one last look before standing up. \"So what have you gathered?\" Sherlock turned to John. \"How long would you say she's been dead?\" John stepped over to the body and crouched down to get a better look. \"Um, about an hour. Not very long, at least.\" Sherlock began pacing the room. \"Which doesn't make sense.\" \"What do you mean?\" Lestrade asked. The consulting detective halted and began to explain. \"The dust pattern near the door doesn't indicate any entry within the last hour and I've already accounted for us and the witness who found the body, so how did she get in?\" he questioned, gesturing around the windowless room. He pointed down to the girl's neck and shoulders. \"She also has a sunburn and it isn't exactly a sunny time of year.\" \"She could have been traveling,\" suggested John. \"No, she has sunscreen still clearly visible so she's applied within the last few hours. Not to mention her shoes. She's been dead for around an hour and it's been raining heavily for over two and a half but there's no sign of her having been out in it. There's also evidence of leftover makeup and her manicure is recent, so she cares about her appearance. But look at her clothes \u2013 she wouldn't walk around in public like that. Looking at the grass stain pattern on her sneakers and ankles I'd say she was running, but she wasn't going on any planned jog. Dirt on her knees and under her nails indicate she was working outdoors \u2013 the pollen on her shorts and bee sting on her leg points to the obvious conclusion of gardening.\" \"Yeah, obvious,\" Lestrade mumbled sarcastically under his breath. Sherlock either ignored him or simply didn't hear, too far gone in his deductions. \"So this teen is working in her garden out in the sun for an extended time and gets burned. Something startles her enough to get her up and running.\" \"Bee sting?\" suggested John. \"It could have shocked her \u2013 caused her to panic some.\" \"Unlikely. If she's an avid gardener she is likely use to stings. It's more possible she saw something or someone that scared her enough to cause her to run. Somehow she ends up here and dies from an electric shock emanating from her bracelet,\" he finished off with a flourish. John and Lestrade look down at the large, metal bracelet on the teen's wrist. Lestrade lowered his head and shook it. \"Poor kid\u2026\"  \"I take it no ID,\" said Sherlock, getting close to the body again. \"Erm, no. We'll be doing fingerprints and DNA after we finish up here.\" Sherlock noticed something misshapen about her shirt and reached under, pulling out a phone tucked into the girl's bra. He stood up and waved it at Lestrade. \"Here's some identification for you.\" He took off the case of the iPhone and read off the name engraved on the back. \"Juliet Michelson.\" Sherlock handed the phone off as he began to head out the door. \"Oh, and she's also American.\" Both Lestrade and John looked surprised by deduction. \"American?\" Lestrade questioned. \"Yes, of course. The west, likely. I'd bet on either Nevada or California. _Pygone High School_?\" \"There are some high schools in the UK,\" Lestrade defended. \"None that are sunny enough to burn someone at this time of year,\" Sherlock retorted. \"I trust you'll keep me updated on anything else you find. I'd also like photographs of the body to examine as well as the bracelet once you're done with it.\" He left the room and called out behind him. \"Come along, John!\" The blogger quickly followed. Sherlock was spouting off theories and details as the two exited the building. \"One moment she's running from something and next she's in London, dead from electrocution. This is an eight at least!\" He clapped his hands together. \"Oh, it's Christmas!\" Anderson watched gloomily from behind the police tape as the duo hailed a cab and left. He pulled out his cellphone and hit a speed dial. The other end picked up quickly. \"Sir, Holmes is getting involved with a case that involves \u2013 er \u2013 us. Do you want me to tell him? \u2026O-Of course\u2026yes, I will, sir\u2026Thank you, sir.\" The idiotic \"forensic scientist\" pocketed his phone with a not-so-happy expression on his face. \t2. Prologue (2)  All was tranquil on Baker Street save it for the frantic rustling of papers as a certain consulting detective pinned news articles, research papers, and photographs on the wall above the couch. Despite it being nearly eleven at night, the genius's mind was racing, refusing to succumb to the body's needs. Yarn was strung between pictures and diagrams. One recurring theme was the symbol on the victim's bracelet. It had been found on two other bodies in the last month \u2013 one died of tuberculosis and the other was in a car accident \u2013 and it could hardly be a coincidence. John was seated in his usual chair with his laptop open, typing away about the case at hand. It was nearly silent when Sherlock let out a frustrated growl and yanked down a closeup of the symbol. As he began to pace as he stared intently at the picture. John looked up over the edge of his computer and over at his flatmate. \"I've seen this somewhere before,\" Sherlock murmured under his breath, photograph up to his face. He plopped down onto the couch and continued to examine the engraving on the bracelet. He swung his legs up onto the couch, lying his head back onto the arm rest. The genius brought his hands up under his chin. \"I'll be heading into my mind palace if you need me.\" \"Not that I'll be able to get your attention,\" John muttered. The blogger enjoyed the quiet for a mere half hour before Sherlock leapt up off the couch, clutching the photograph in his hand. John looked up at his flatmate. \"You find it?\" \"An icosahedron,\" Sherlock answered promptly. \"Geometric vector often representing water and traits associated to it.\" \"Okay\u2026so what's the importance of the shape?\" Sherlock began pacing the floor. \"That's what I aim to find out. Three bodies in the last month have been found with this symbol somewhere on their person \u2013 a tattoo, a slip of paper, and a bracelet \u2013 they have to be connected somehow.\" \"Well, maybe it's some kind of \u2013 I dunno \u2013 club?\" suggested John. \"One of the victims was from across the Atlantic,\" Sherlock reminded. \"I doubt they had weekly meetings. No, it's something else.\" He approached his makeshift evidence board. \"How did she end up there?\u2026\" Sherlock tapped on one of the photos of the crime scene. \"That's the major question.\" A knock at the threshold caused both men to turn. Mrs. Hudson stood at the door. \"Sorry, I think the doorbell's broken again. You've got visitors.\" \"Show them up, Mrs. Hudson.\" \"Thank you,\" John called out after her as their landlady headed back down the stairs. He shot Sherlock a look. Two men walked up the stairs and into the flat and John stood to greet them. The consulting detective looked over and instantly glared. \"What are you doing here,\" he sneered at Anderson. The man standing in front of the forensic scientist stepped forward. \"He's with me,\" the man stated calmly, folder tucked safely under his arm. Sherlock's eyes narrowed. \"American,\" he noted upon hearing his accent. \"You have something about the Michelson case.\" \"You could say that,\" the man said with a shrug. He extended his hand. \"Agent Phil Coulson.\" After a few awkward moments of Sherlock not accepting the gesture, John shook his hand instead. \"Pleasure meeting you,\" said John. \"I'm\u2013\"  \"Doctor Watson and Sherlock Holmes,\" Agent Coulson said with a grin. \"I'm honoured to finally meet you both.\" \"Who do you work for?\" Sherlock said before John could reply. \"SHIELD,\" Coulson answered. \"I'm going to assume you've heard of it.\" \"I have.\" Coulson smiled and nodded. \"Then you'll know why I'm here.\" Sherlock glared. \"My original question still stands.\" He jerked his head towards Anderson. \"What is he doing here?\" Anderson's hands balled into fists. \"It just so happens my boss asked me to come with him.\" John clearly looked very confused. \"I'm sorry \u2013 boss?\" His eyes flickered between Coulson and Anderson as Sherlock's did the same. Coulson stepped further into the flat and gestured to the couch. \"Do you mind if I\u2026?\" his question trailed off. \"Oh, of course,\" said John. The agent smiled and nodded in thanks, taking a seat on the piece of furniture. Sherlock took a few moments to stare Anderson down before the forensic scientist huffed and sat down next to Coulson. Sherlock sulked over to his usual seat and studied the two guests intently. John cleared his throat. \"You want anything? Tea?\" he offered. \"No thank you,\" the agent said kindly. \"I'm here on business.\" \"Obviously,\" Sherlock scoffed. \"Now, Agent Coulson, why would the man who assembled the Avengers have a connection to that idiot\u2013\" he jerked his head towards Anderson, \"\u2013 and what do you want with me?\" John's eyes went wide and he looked towards Sherlock. Coulson smirked. \"They did say you were good.\" He leaned back into the cushions and folded his hands. \"Mr. Holmes, SHIELD has had an eye on you through Agent Anderson for a long time now.\" John spluttered and even Sherlock looked mildly shocked. \"That's why you were never fired,\" Sherlock concluded after a few moments, \"someone of higher power was keeping you in place. Forensic science wasn't your original position considering how awful you were at it.\" \"Of course it wasn't,\" Anderson shot back. \"There was an open position and my superiors needed me on the inside.\" \"Wait,\" said John, \"if you're here on Sherlock's behalf why are you so\u2026\" he trailed off, not sure how to phrase the sentence without insulting the man. Anderson rolled his eyes. \"Just because I'm required to keep tabs on him doesn't mean I have to like him.\" He shot the consultant a look. Coulson cleared his throat pointedly and Anderson's mouth snapped shut. He frowned, folding his arms and leaning back into the couch. Coulson turned to look towards Sherlock and John again. \"SHIELD wants to offer you a job.\" \"Not interested.\" \"I do believe our proposition will intrigue you.\" Coulson pulled the folder out from under his arm and stood, handing it over to Sherlock. The genius accepted the file and opened it, flipping through the papers. \"You crave puzzles and, let me assure you, mutants provide those.\" \"Juliet Michelson was a mutant, wasn't she?\" It was more of a statement than a question. \"That's correct,\" Coulson confirmed. \"She had the ability of teleportation.\" \"Which explains why she ended up in another country in seemingly an instant.\" He looked up from the files. \"Thank you for ruining the puzzle for me.\" Anderson scoffed and both Coulson and Sherlock shot him a look, Sherlock's gaze more aggressive of course. \"Mr. Holmes, we need you to find who killed Juliet Michelson \u2013 she wasn't the only one. SHIELD has reason to believe the man who died of tuberculosis last week \u2013 Jacob Rytrot \u2013 was another victim.\" \"The icosahedron links them.\" Coulson nodded. \"We want you to track that organisation down as well as inform us of any mutants that make themselves known. We know you can; you tracked down and dismantled James Moriarty's web with fair ease.\" \"I'd hardly consider it that.\" Coulson stood and Anderson followed his actions. \"Well, if you change your mind and want to take the case, let Anderson or I,\" he took a card from our of his breast pocket, setting it down on the coffee table, \"know.\" He smiled kindly and he and the undercover agent left. As soon as the sound of the front door closing echoed through the flat John turned around to Sherlock, not sure what to say. \"\u2026So\u2026you taking the offer?\" he settled on asking. Pensive, Sherlock stared at the card on the table before picking it up and fiddling with it in his hands. He looked up at his evidence board, eyes skimming over all the work he'd done. Eventually, he came to an answer. \"Yes.\" \t3. Mirror Murder  Two weeks after Agent Coulson had stopped by and recruited Sherlock, John found the detective continuing to add the the makeshift evidence board that was still hung up on the wall above the couch. The stroppy detective had been waiting for a new case and nothing had arisen, leading him to fall into one of his bad moods. Not a whole lot of new information had come up regarding the Michelson case and the trail had gone cold; the fact that it was unsolved aggravated the detective every day. John was reaching his limit listening to Sherlock complain when Lestrade stopped by with a case to save the day. There was a murder in South London and it looked anything but normal. Sherlock, John, and Lestrade sat in 221B examining photos of the crime scene. \"When we showed up the dust stirred, erasing what little strange evidence we did have,\" Lestrade explained. He handed Sherlock a picture. \"But we managed to snap a few pictures.\" The victim was lying face down on the floor with evidence of a scuffle around him. To and from the body, imprinted in the dust and dirt, were footprints. The other photos went to show that the footprints led to and from a large mirror on the wall. \"Victim's name was Evan Warren. Locked room,\" said Lestrade, \"no signs of forced entry and there were no windows.\" Sherlock continued to flip through the pictures. \"What do you make of it?\" Sherlock slapped down the photographs. \"I take it the body's been taken to the morgue.\" \"It has.\" Sherlock stood and walked over to the hook which he jacket hung. Along the way he shrugged off his robe and it landed soundlessly on the floor", "is_question": false}}

The pathologist pulled back the cloth over the body and Sherlock instantly got to work. _Cause of death: Knife wound to throat_  _Owner of two cats_  _Recently divorced_  _Works indoors (desk job)_  _Icosahedron tattoo_  Sherlock halted and stared at the victim's left arm. \"John\u2026\"  The doctor looked over and froze. \"It's the same symbol.\" \"What, so he's connected to the Michelson murder?\" John questioned. \"He's related somehow.\" He pointed to where the tattoo was placed \u2013 which was the inner-forearm. \"This tattoo is in the same part of the body as Garret Vales.\" \"What, the man who died in the car accident a while back?\" \"That's the one.\" The duo stared at the body for a few moments longer. \"I need to find what this symbol represents,\" Sherlock determined, \"it's the keystone to the problem.

The blogger picked up the news article lying on the table. The headline read:\u00a0 **Mysterious locked room murder! A killer that can walk through walls? **  John held up the paper for Sherlock to see. \"You take a look at this?\" he questioned. Sherlock briefly glanced over his shoulder then went back to his work. \"Yes, the papers do always seem to exaggerate, don't they?\" John set the paper down on the table again. \"Well, maybe they aren't exaggerating \u2013 well, unknowingly. Who knows? Maybe this killer really can walk through walls.\" There was a long silence between the two and for a while John had simply concluded the detective had ignored him. Then Sherlock turned around. \"John, you're brilliant.\" \"Hm?\" Sherlock dashed to the photographs of the latest crime and took them down from the wall and examined them closely. \"The footprints, John. There's no doubt the killer was a mutant \u2013 the chances they weren't are extremely low \u2013 so it's quite likely they used their abilities to commit the crime.\" He walked quickly over to his flatmate and pointed the photos. \"The footprints, look at the footprints!\" John took the picture from Sherlock's hand and his eyes skimmed over it. \"They're to and from the mirror\u2026\" He raised an eyebrow at the detective. \"You aren't seriously suggesting\u2013\"  \"I was hardly the one who suggested it John,\" Sherlock pointed out, gesturing to the newspaper. The sound of thudding footsteps on the staircase caused both men to turn. Lestrade soon stood in the doorway. \"There's been a second killing,\" Sherlock said, before the DI could speak. Lestrade simply nodded. \"And it was exactly the same?\" \"Yes.\" \"Identical?\" \"Of course.\" \"Did he have the same tattoo as the last victim?\" \"Yes.\" \"We're the footprints just as the last murder?\" \"What?\" \"The footprints, Lestrade!\" \"Er, yeah,\" he said. \"Yeah, the only sign of someone else in the room was near the body and a mirror.\" Sherlock clapped his hands together and grinned manically. \"Yes! Perfect!\" He took the photos back from John and headed over to the evidence board and began pinning them up again. \"I won't be needing to take at the crime scene, Inspector, I've nearly figured it out.\" Lestrade nodded slowly. \"Right\u2026\" He cleared his throat. \"In that case I'll be off. Sent me a message when you've got it, yeah?\" \"Of course.\" Lestrade gave John a smile and went back out of the flat. John turned to his flatmate. \"You've nearly figured it out?\" he questioned. Sherlock was looking back and forth between his evidence wall and the fireplace. \"Yes, of course. Didn't you hear me?\" He rushed over to the fireplace and began readjusting the mirror that hung over it. He looked over his shoulder, trying to find the right angle. \"I suspect we'll have the killer soon.\" \"You do?\" John asked. Sherlock walked over to the couch and stood in front of it, staring into the mirror. \"If he follows his pattern of associating with the icosahedron, which I'm certain he will.\" He grinned at his flatmate. \"Tonight would be a good night to do it.\" \"Do what, exactly?\" \"Come after me,\" answered Sherlock, as if it were the most obvious thing in the world. \"I'm sorry, what?\" John questioned in shock. \"Why would you be a target?\" Sherlock placed his hands under his chin in his classic ' _thinking pose_.' \"John, go stand directly in front of the fireplace.\" John humphed but did as the detective asked. He turned around to face Sherlock. \"Now,\" the detective stepped to the side, \"if you're looking straight ahead, what do you see?\" John looked over at the evidence wall. \"All the pictures, papers, and maps you put up.\" \"But specifically\u2026?\" \"Um\u2026the photos of the crime scene and the tattoo.\" Sherlock grinned. \"Exactly.\" John's eyes widened. \"What, you mean you're\u00a0 _trying_ \u00a0to attract the killer?\" Sherlock shrugged. \"Yes, so we can restrain him, of course.\" John shook his head and ran a hand over his face. \"If you want to summon a murdering superhuman that's on you.\" He snatched up his phone and began heading up the stairs to his room. -/:\\\\-/:\\\\-/:\\\\-/:\\\\-/:\\\\-/:\\\\-/:\\\\-/:\\\\-/:\\\\-/:\\\\-/:\\\\-/:\\\\-/:\\\\-/:\\\\-/:\\\\-/:\\\\-/:\\\\-  That night was eventful. John had nearly drifted off to sleep several times, only to be awoken by noises from downstairs. By midnight he was a little more than angry at the consulting detective and marched downstairs to give his flatmate a good talking to. When he entered the living room for a moment Sherlock couldn't be found. However, the blogger quickly located the detective in the kitchen. Before John could even get anything out of his mouth, Sherlock spoke. \"John, it shouldn't be much longer.\" The doctor folded his arms. \"Much longer before what?\" Sherlock looked over at John. \"The killer makes himself known.\" John sighed and rolled his eyes. \"Of herself,\" Sherlock said (mostly to himself), \"although the murderer being male is statistically more likely\u2013\"  \"Sherlock, even you need sleep sometimes,\" John interrupted. Sherlock's gaze drifted over to the living room. \"John.\" \"No, Sherlock,\" the doctor persisted, \"you actually need to take into account what your body needs for once.\" \"John\u2013\"  \"I don't care if it's 'transport,' it's what keeping you going on your feet, so you'd better get to sleep tonight or so help me\u2013\"  Sherlock stood, abruptly cutting off his flatmate's rant. \"John!\" The blogger noticed where his friend's line of eyesight was and turned around. There stood a man in their living room, pulling his hand out of the mirror. The towering man glowered down on the two. \"What do you know about that symbol?\" he questioned, jerking his head towards the evidence board. John's eyes flickered between the photos and the mutant in the room. On the other hand, Sherlock was surprisingly collected. \"Just about nothing,\" he confessed. John turned to his friend in shock. \"I was hoping you would enlighten us.\" \"You're a copper,\" the man accused. Sherlock scoffed and rolled his eyes. \"Hardly. And you're the man who killed Evan Warren.\" The man seemed to growl. \"That monster deserved to die.\" \"Why?\" \"I ain't tellin' you!\" The killer lunged for Sherlock who ducked out of the way. \"John, the mirror!\" Sherlock called out. Both John and the killer looked over at the the mirror where the murderer had come from. Catching Sherlock's train of thought, John leapt for the fire pokers, snatched one up, and smashed it into the mirror, causing it to killer yelled out in anger and abandoned his attempt on Sherlock and moved on to John. He pulled a knife from his pocket, ready to strike. Luckily, he was completely inexperienced and up against a soldier so John easily disarmed the man. Two against one could hardly be considered fair, but the tenants of 221B overpowered the mutant, rendering him unconscious. Sherlock scoffed. \"Amateur,\" he mumbled under his breath. -/:\\\\-/:\\\\-/:\\\\-/:\\\\-/:\\\\-/:\\\\-/:\\\\-/:\\\\-/:\\\\-/:\\\\-/:\\\\-/:\\\\-/:\\\\-/:\\\\-/:\\\\-/:\\\\-/:\\\\-  \"So, how'd he know to come and get you?\" Lestrade questioned as some other cops ushered the man away in handcuffs. \"Must've caught wind I was on the case,\" Sherlock said with a shrug. \"I'm easier to find than a cop.\" Lestrade had his 'I-know-you're-lying-to-me-but-I'm-simply-not-going-to-question-it' face and John understood the facial cue. He cleared his throat. \"Thank you though, for coming to help us out,\" he said. The inspector sighed. \"Not a problem \u2013 I would've ended up with him anyway.\" He thanked the two again and trotted down the stairs. As Lestrade headed down, Anderson came on up. Sherlock's eyes narrowed. \"Why are you here?\" he sneered. \"You know very well why,\" Anderson snapped back. He paused the jerked his head down the stairs. \"SHIELD will take care of this.\" \"Of course,\" John cut in before Sherlock could throw any more insults around. \"Keep him away from mirrors. We don't think he can travel through all reflections, but definitely mirrors.\" He glanced over at the mess of glass on the floor and on the mantel. Anderson nodded. \"Yeah, we'll make sure of that.\" Without anything more he turned on his heel and left, determined to leave the flat. John looked over to Sherlock who walked over the window and watched the cop cars drive off. The doctor couldn't exactly think of anything to say, then decided there was nothing to be said and went upstairs into his room. \t4. How 'Bout That Weather? Considering it was November, it was quite warm in London. In fact, unnaturally warm. There hadn't been a single snowfall yet and it was beginning to baffle meteorologists. Not that Sherlock Holmes was interested in such trivial things as the weather. That was, until it started affecting him. The temperature continued to rise rather than fall as it should, and in the middle of November, it was too hot for Sherlock to wear the coat or scarf. It was making him grumpy and soon he searched for answers to no avail. The entire world was baffled that only England was affected by what several people claimed to be global warming. It just wasn't right. Luckily, answers surfaced after a week of torture. Sherlock's phone which sat on the table in the living room began to ring. John was sitting across from it and looked over the top of his laptop at it. Sherlock came in from the kitchen where he was conducting an experiment and answered it. \"Sherlock Holmes.\" _ \"It's Coulson \u2013 I think I've got something for you to look into.\" _  \"The weather, yes?\" _ \"Yes. It's unnatural on its own, then SHIELD pinpointed an epicentre. I'm sending you the info now.\" _ Sherlock's phone chimed and he took it down from his ear, opening the file that had just been sent to him. \"Who was that?\" John asked. \"Agent Coulson.\" Sherlock's eyes scanned over the map on his phone. \"He has a case for us.\" The blogger sat up straighter. \"Oh?\" \"The weather,\" Sherlock replied. He pocketed his phone and headed for the door. \"SHIELD believes there is something or someone causing it,\" he stopped at the doorway and turned back, \"and we're going to find out what.\" -/:\\\\-/:\\\\-/:\\\\-/:\\\\-/:\\\\-/:\\\\-/:\\\\-/:\\\\-/:\\\\-/:\\\\-/:\\\\-/:\\\\-/:\\\\-/:\\\\-/:\\\\-/:\\\\-/:\\\\-  Sherlock double checked his phone as he and John approached an old warehouse on the outskirts of the city. It was quite warm and it was only getting hotter the closer the two got to the building. John couldn't understand how Sherlock was still upright in the suit he was wearing. \"This should be it,\" said the detective, looking up at the warehouse. He turned to John. \"Have you got your gun?\" \"Of course I have my gun,\" John mumbled, pulling it out from his jeans. Sherlock smirked. \"Well, let's bring the weather to order.\" He pushed the door open and silently entered the building, John backing him up. Near the center of the warehouse, there was a figure kneeling on the ground, curled up on themselves. Sherlock and John shared a look. \"Hello?\" John called out. The figure stiffened then turned around. The man had a thin layer of sweat on his skin and was shaking. As soon as his manic eyes landed on the gun in John's hands he began to scramble away. John realised his mistake and stowed his weapon away. \"What's your name?\" questioned Sherlock, putting out a hand and cautiously approaching. The man gaped for a couple of moments before responding. \"R-Ross.\" Sherlock nodded. \"Ross, do you understand what's going on?\" \"I'm one of them\u2026\" he muttered. \"No, I'm one of them!\" He curled further in on himself. John stepped forward. \"What do you mean one of them?\" he asked. He had nearly reached the panicking man. \"I'm a \u2013 I'm a mutant. I-I didn't\u2026\" Ross looked down at himself and shook. \"I'm not\u2026human.\" John kneeled down next to the man. \"Yes you are,\" he insisted. \"You are no less human than he or I are,\" he said, gesturing to Sherlock. \"I didn't think I'd have it, I\u2013\" he cut off with a sob. \"God, my kids!\" He grabbed his head. \"My kids might be \u2013 might be\u2026\" Ross lowered his head into his knees, sobbing. Cautiously, John put a hand on the man's shoulder. Ross flinched but otherwise didn't react. \"You have kids?\" Ross nodded, face still in his knees. \"They need their father, don't they?\" Ross shook his head. \"Not me \u2013 not a monster like me.\" \"You are not a monster,\" John said firmly. \"There are people in the world just like you \u2013 you aren't alone.\" Ross raised his head and ran a hand over his tear-filled eyes. \"Even though my mother\u2026I thought I wouldn't have it,\" he muttered. \"I-I didn't think it was genetic.\" Ross looked up at John in fear", "is_question": false}}

Something must have struck a chord with the panicking inhuman because the surrounding air became noticeably cooler. John turned around and made eye contact with Sherlock. The detective nodded, encouraging John to keep doing what he was doing. John turned back to Ross. \"How old are your kids?\" he asked. \"Five and ten,\" Ross mumbled. \"They need their father,\" John insisted. Ross nodded, staring at the ground. \"Little Rosie must be so scared,\" muttered Ross, clasping his hands together. \"Is that your daughter?\" John asked softly. Ross smiled. \"Yes. She's a sweetheart. I-I told her brother to take care of her.\" Ross looked back up at John. \"But I should do that.\" That was the breakthrough. A gust of freezing air swept through the warehouse and the temperature instantly felt as it should. As he did all he could to prevent his teeth from chattering, John helped Ross to his feet. Ross broke down into tears and fell into the blogger. John caught the younger man and kept him upright. \"How 'bout we get you a cab, alright?\" John led Ross out of the building with Sherlock trailing behind. After John had hailed a cab for Ross and handed him enough money to cover the fare, Sherlock cleared his throat. \"What you did, that-that was\u2026\"  John gave a sad sort of smile and looked up at his friend. \"Yeah, it was good.\" Sherlock nodded. \"We'll inform SHIELD of him, of course.\" \"Of course,\" John agreed with a nod. \"But we should make sure they don't bother him. He's been through enough right now.\" Sherlock simply 'hmm'ed in response. He looked over at John who was shivering. \"I suppose we should head back to the flat and contact Agent Coulson.\" \"Yes, that sounds like a plan.\" Sherlock looked up and saw that snow was beginning to fall. He smirked a bit. \"Looks like London's getting its first snowfall of the season,\" he said as he hailed a cab. \"Yeah, well it's a little late if you ask me,\" John commented. The two snickered as a cab pulled up to the curb. With satisfied smiles on their faces, the detective and the blogger headed home.", "is_question": false}}

Since Agent Phil Coulson showed up in 221B, John had talked down inhumans from blowing their powers out of proportion, become friends (Friends? Acquaintances? That was still up in the air) with a teen addict who could shapeshift into monsters, he'd time traveled, been a telepath for a day, and met two Avengers. And that was by no means all of it. One thing that had not yet happened to Doctor Watson, however, was being asked to do something in the name of SHIELD. Did he expect to? One day, of course, he was an agent after all. The day just came up on him a little quicker than he would have guessed.", "is_question": false}}

This suggests a meeting time in the early morning hours.\n\n2. **Where:** \n   - Mark specifies a rendezvous point \"where the trains are supplied.\" This implies a location near a train station or depot where trains are housed or maintained.

It could imply a relatively secluded spot along the shoreline, possibly for discretion.\n\n2. **Time**: \n   - **\"When the sun starts its travel across the sky\"** (Dr. Clifford Queenane): This indicates early morning, likely around sunrise. The exact time would depend on the geographic location, but it could be within the first hour or so after dawn.\n\n### Recommendations on What to Bring:\n\n1. **Persuasion Strategy**: \n   - **To address Mr. Fergal Mullany's request**, have documents or materials that support a persuasive argument for the border guards. This could include:\n     - A well-prepared presentation or talking points.\n     - Relevant permits or identification.\n     - Any documentation that highlights the legitimacy of your presence or purpose.\n\n2. **Supplies for the Setting**: \n   - Since the meeting is at a coastal setting, consider bringing:\n     - A blanket or portable seating for comfort.\n     - Refreshments (like water or light snacks) for the group during their discussion.\n     - Binoculars for surveying the area, if needed.\n\n3. **Communication Tools**:\n   - Having a phone or walkie-talkie might be useful for coordination, especially if the meeting involves multiple parties.\n\nIn summary, the meeting seems set for early morning at a beach or coastal location. It would be wise to prepare both a persuasive approach for the border guards and anything practical needed for the outdoor setting.", "is_question": true}}
