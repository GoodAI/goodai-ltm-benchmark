    "Test (2024-08-23 09:09:00.257562): There is a Park in the center of my hometown.",
    "Agent (2024-08-23 09:09:01.380829): That sounds lovely! Parks often serve as great community spaces for recreational activities, relaxation, and social gatherings. What do you enjoy most about the park in your hometown? Are there any specific features or events that make it special?",
    "Test (2024-08-23 09:09:01.389193): I visited Museum, which is 2 KM, East from Park.",
    "Agent (2024-08-23 09:09:02.713679): That sounds like a nice visit! Museums can be wonderful places to learn about art, history, or science. The 2 km distance from the park makes for a pleasant walk or bike ride if the weather is nice. Was there anything specific that caught your attention in the museum? Or do you often visit both the park and the museum?",
    "Test (2024-08-23 09:09:02.724116): About 1 km East of the Museum there is a High Street",
    "Agent (2024-08-23 09:09:04.148007): It sounds like you have a nice little area centered around the park, museum, and high street! High streets often have shops, restaurants, and cafes, making them great spots for shopping or grabbing a bite to eat. Do you often visit the high street after going to the museum or the park? What are some of your favorite places to go there?",
    "Test (2024-08-23 09:09:04.158735): About 4 km South of the High Street there is a Retail Area",
    "Agent (2024-08-23 09:09:06.196199): That sounds like a well-connected area in your hometown! A retail area can offer a variety of shopping options, including supermarkets, boutiques, or larger department stores. With the retail area being 4 km south of the high street, it provides a nice opportunity for a more extensive shopping trip or even a fun day out. Do you often visit the retail area? Are there any specific shops or places you particularly enjoy there?",
    "Test (2024-08-23 09:09:06.206334): Library is a location in my home town, it is 3 KM, West from Retail Area.",
    "Agent (2024-08-23 09:09:08.040271): Great! It sounds like your hometown has a good mix of cultural and recreational spots. A library is such an important resource for the community, offering access to books, computers, and often hosting events or programs. With the library being 3 km west of the retail area, it could be a nice addition to your visits in the area, allowing for some quiet time to read or study after shopping. Do you have a favorite section in the library, or do you participate in any programs or events there?",
    "Test (2024-08-23 09:09:08.051014): And finally there is Statue of Founder which is West from Library and 4 KM from it.",
    "Agent (2024-08-23 09:09:09.678367): That sounds like a significant landmark in your hometown! A statue of the founder often represents local history and pride, adding a sense of character to the area. Being 4 km west of the library makes it a nice destination for a walk or a bike ride, especially if you enjoy exploring your town\u2019s heritage. Have you visited the statue of the founder? Is there anything special about the statue or the area surrounding it that you enjoy?",
    "Test (2024-08-23 09:09:09.690411): Given the points of interest that I have told you about, how would I travel from Park to Statue of Founder following those interesting points?",
