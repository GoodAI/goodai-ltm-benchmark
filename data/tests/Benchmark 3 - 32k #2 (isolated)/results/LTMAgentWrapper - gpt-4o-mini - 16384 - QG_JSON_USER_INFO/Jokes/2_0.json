    "Test (2024-08-20 08:11:32.116168): Atheism is a non-prophet organization",
    "Agent (2024-08-20 08:11:36.115306): That's a clever play on words! The phrase \"non-prophet organization\" humorously highlights the idea that atheism does not involve belief in prophets or divine figures, while also using a pun on \"non-profit organization.\" It's a witty way to express a perspective on atheism. Would you like to discuss more about atheism or related topics?",
    "Test (2024-08-20 09:14:36.117963): Just burned 2,000 calories. That\u2019s the last time I leave brownies in the oven while I nap.",
    "Agent (2024-08-20 09:14:56.260380): That's a funny way to put it! It sounds like you had quite the baking adventure. Hopefully, the brownies didn't turn out too burnt! Do you often bake, or was this a one-time thing?",
    "Test (2024-08-20 11:32:56.263508): It takes a lot of balls to golf the way I do.",

    "Test (2024-08-20 13:11:00.671689): I went to buy some camo pants but couldn\u2019t find any.",
    "Agent (2024-08-20 13:11:05.724584): That's a classic joke! The humor comes from the irony of trying to find something that's supposed to be camouflaged. Do you enjoy telling jokes like that?",
