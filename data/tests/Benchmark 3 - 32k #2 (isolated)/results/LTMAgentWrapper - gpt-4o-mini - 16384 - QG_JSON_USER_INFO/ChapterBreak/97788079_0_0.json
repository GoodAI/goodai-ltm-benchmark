Prologue (1)  ** Timeline: **  ** SH: Post-Reichenbach, but does not follow series 3. **  ** MCU: Post-Civil War **  ** Ships: None **  ** Please enjoy! **  Patiently waiting for a case had paid off, because it wasn't long before Lestrade was on the threshold of 221B asking for Sherlock's help in a case. The scene of the death wasn't far so it took a short cab ride of a few minutes for the three of them to get there and the consulting detective was instantly all over the scene before they'd even entered the building. After throwing a few quick insults at Anderson and Donovan, Sherlock led the group headed into the building, up the stairs, and onto the crime scene. As soon as the genius saw the body he got to work, crouching down and examining all possibilities. The DI and the blogger watched on as Sherlock worked intently. The victim had to have been underage, which made the whole situation a bit more solemn. She was lying on her back with her limbs sprawled out, eyes shut peacefully. The teen wore a white\u00a0 _Shakespeare's Globe Theatre_ \u00a0t-shirt and maroon gym shorts with the words\u00a0 _Pygone High School_ \u00a0on the left pant-leg. Sherlock's eyes processed her clothing then moved on to the clunky metal bracelet she wore. \"Well?\" Lestrade questioned. \"This is definitely worth calling me in for,\" the genius quickly replied, going over the conditions of her skin. Lestrade ran a hand over his face. \"Which means it's stranger than I initially thought. Great.\" John couldn't help but crack a smile. Sherlock gave the body one last look before standing up. \"So what have you gathered?\" Sherlock turned to John. \"How long would you say she's been dead?\" John stepped over to the body and crouched down to get a better look. \"Um, about an hour. Not very long, at least.\" Sherlock began pacing the room. \"Which doesn't make sense.\" \"What do you mean?\" Lestrade asked. The consulting detective halted and began to explain. \"The dust pattern near the door doesn't indicate any entry within the last hour and I've already accounted for us and the witness who found the body, so how did she get in?\" he questioned, gesturing around the windowless room. He pointed down to the girl's neck and shoulders. \"She also has a sunburn and it isn't exactly a sunny time of year.\" \"She could have been traveling,\" suggested John. \"No, she has sunscreen still clearly visible so she's applied within the last few hours. Not to mention her shoes. She's been dead for around an hour and it's been raining heavily for over two and a half but there's no sign of her having been out in it. There's also evidence of leftover makeup and her manicure is recent, so she cares about her appearance. But look at her clothes \u2013 she wouldn't walk around in public like that. Looking at the grass stain pattern on her sneakers and ankles I'd say she was running, but she wasn't going on any planned jog. Dirt on her knees and under her nails indicate she was working outdoors \u2013 the pollen on her shorts and bee sting on her leg points to the obvious conclusion of gardening.\" \"Yeah, obvious,\" Lestrade mumbled sarcastically under his breath. Sherlock either ignored him or simply didn't hear, too far gone in his deductions. \"So this teen is working in her garden out in the sun for an extended time and gets burned. Something startles her enough to get her up and running.\" \"Bee sting?\" suggested John. \"It could have shocked her \u2013 caused her to panic some.\" \"Unlikely. If she's an avid gardener she is likely use to stings. It's more possible she saw something or someone that scared her enough to cause her to run. Somehow she ends up here and dies from an electric shock emanating from her bracelet,\" he finished off with a flourish. John and Lestrade look down at the large, metal bracelet on the teen's wrist. Lestrade lowered his head and shook it. \"Poor kid\u2026\"  \"I take it no ID,\" said Sherlock, getting close to the body again. \"Erm, no. We'll be doing fingerprints and DNA after we finish up here.\" Sherlock noticed something misshapen about her shirt and reached under, pulling out a phone tucked into the girl's bra. He stood up and waved it at Lestrade. \"Here's some identification for you.\" He took off the case of the iPhone and read off the name engraved on the back. \"Juliet Michelson.\" Sherlock handed the phone off as he began to head out the door. \"Oh, and she's also American.\" Both Lestrade and John looked surprised by deduction. \"American?\" Lestrade questioned. \"Yes, of course. The west, likely. I'd bet on either Nevada or California. _Pygone High School_?\" \"There are some high schools in the UK,\" Lestrade defended. \"None that are sunny enough to burn someone at this time of year,\" Sherlock retorted. \"I trust you'll keep me updated on anything else you find. I'd also like photographs of the body to examine as well as the bracelet once you're done with it.\" He left the room and called out behind him. \"Come along, John!\" The blogger quickly followed. Sherlock was spouting off theories and details as the two exited the building. \"One moment she's running from something and next she's in London, dead from electrocution. This is an eight at least!\" He clapped his hands together. \"Oh, it's Christmas!\" Anderson watched gloomily from behind the police tape as the duo hailed a cab and left. He pulled out his cellphone and hit a speed dial. The other end picked up quickly. \"Sir, Holmes is getting involved with a case that involves \u2013 er \u2013 us. Do you want me to tell him? \u2026O-Of course\u2026yes, I will, sir\u2026Thank you, sir.\" The idiotic \"forensic scientist\" pocketed his phone with a not-so-happy expression on his face. \t2. Prologue (2)  All was tranquil on Baker Street save it for the frantic rustling of papers as a certain consulting detective pinned news articles, research papers, and photographs on the wall above the couch. Despite it being nearly eleven at night, the genius's mind was racing, refusing to succumb to the body's needs. Yarn was strung between pictures and diagrams. One recurring theme was the symbol on the victim's bracelet. It had been found on two other bodies in the last month \u2013 one died of tuberculosis and the other was in a car accident \u2013 and it could hardly be a coincidence. John was seated in his usual chair with his laptop open, typing away about the case at hand. It was nearly silent when Sherlock let out a frustrated growl and yanked down a closeup of the symbol. As he began to pace as he stared intently at the picture. John looked up over the edge of his computer and over at his flatmate. \"I've seen this somewhere before,\" Sherlock murmured under his breath, photograph up to his face. He plopped down onto the couch and continued to examine the engraving on the bracelet. He swung his legs up onto the couch, lying his head back onto the arm rest. The genius brought his hands up under his chin. \"I'll be heading into my mind palace if you need me.\" \"Not that I'll be able to get your attention,\" John muttered. The blogger enjoyed the quiet for a mere half hour before Sherlock leapt up off the couch, clutching the photograph in his hand. John looked up at his flatmate. \"You find it?\" \"An icosahedron,\" Sherlock answered promptly. \"Geometric vector often representing water and traits associated to it.\" \"Okay\u2026so what's the importance of the shape?\" Sherlock began pacing the floor. \"That's what I aim to find out. Three bodies in the last month have been found with this symbol somewhere on their person \u2013 a tattoo, a slip of paper, and a bracelet \u2013 they have to be connected somehow.\" \"Well, maybe it's some kind of \u2013 I dunno \u2013 club?\" suggested John. \"One of the victims was from across the Atlantic,\" Sherlock reminded. \"I doubt they had weekly meetings. No, it's something else.\" He approached his makeshift evidence board. \"How did she end up there?\u2026\" Sherlock tapped on one of the photos of the crime scene. \"That's the major question.\" A knock at the threshold caused both men to turn. Mrs. Hudson stood at the door. \"Sorry, I think the doorbell's broken again. You've got visitors.\" \"Show them up, Mrs. Hudson.\" \"Thank you,\" John called out after her as their landlady headed back down the stairs. He shot Sherlock a look. Two men walked up the stairs and into the flat and John stood to greet them. The consulting detective looked over and instantly glared. \"What are you doing here,\" he sneered at Anderson. The man standing in front of the forensic scientist stepped forward. \"He's with me,\" the man stated calmly, folder tucked safely under his arm. Sherlock's eyes narrowed. \"American,\" he noted upon hearing his accent. \"You have something about the Michelson case.\" \"You could say that,\" the man said with a shrug. He extended his hand. \"Agent Phil Coulson.\" After a few awkward moments of Sherlock not accepting the gesture, John shook his hand instead. \"Pleasure meeting you,\" said John. \"I'm\u2013\"  \"Doctor Watson and Sherlock Holmes,\" Agent Coulson said with a grin. \"I'm honoured to finally meet you both.\" \"Who do you work for?\" Sherlock said before John could reply. \"SHIELD,\" Coulson answered. \"I'm going to assume you've heard of it.\" \"I have.\" Coulson smiled and nodded. \"Then you'll know why I'm here.\" Sherlock glared. \"My original question still stands.\" He jerked his head towards Anderson. \"What is he doing here?\" Anderson's hands balled into fists. \"It just so happens my boss asked me to come with him.\" John clearly looked very confused. \"I'm sorry \u2013 boss?\" His eyes flickered between Coulson and Anderson as Sherlock's did the same. Coulson stepped further into the flat and gestured to the couch. \"Do you mind if I\u2026?\" his question trailed off. \"Oh, of course,\" said John. The agent smiled and nodded in thanks, taking a seat on the piece of furniture. Sherlock took a few moments to stare Anderson down before the forensic scientist huffed and sat down next to Coulson. Sherlock sulked over to his usual seat and studied the two guests intently. John cleared his throat. \"You want anything? Tea?\" he offered. \"No thank you,\" the agent said kindly. \"I'm here on business.\" \"Obviously,\" Sherlock scoffed. \"Now, Agent Coulson, why would the man who assembled the Avengers have a connection to that idiot\u2013\" he jerked his head towards Anderson, \"\u2013 and what do you want with me?\" John's eyes went wide and he looked towards Sherlock. Coulson smirked. \"They did say you were good.\" He leaned back into the cushions and folded his hands. \"Mr. Holmes, SHIELD has had an eye on you through Agent Anderson for a long time now.\" John spluttered and even Sherlock looked mildly shocked. \"That's why you were never fired,\" Sherlock concluded after a few moments, \"someone of higher power was keeping you in place. Forensic science wasn't your original position considering how awful you were at it.\" \"Of course it wasn't,\" Anderson shot back. \"There was an open position and my superiors needed me on the inside.\" \"Wait,\" said John, \"if you're here on Sherlock's behalf why are you so\u2026\" he trailed off, not sure how to phrase the sentence without insulting the man. Anderson rolled his eyes. \"Just because I'm required to keep tabs on him doesn't mean I have to like him.\" He shot the consultant a look. Coulson cleared his throat pointedly and Anderson's mouth snapped shut. He frowned, folding his arms and leaning back into the couch. Coulson turned to look towards Sherlock and John again. \"SHIELD wants to offer you a job.\" \"Not interested.\" \"I do believe our proposition will intrigue you.\" Coulson pulled the folder out from under his arm and stood, handing it over to Sherlock. The genius accepted the file and opened it, flipping through the papers. \"You crave puzzles and, let me assure you, mutants provide those.\" \"Juliet Michelson was a mutant, wasn't she?\" It was more of a statement than a question. \"That's correct,\" Coulson confirmed. \"She had the ability of teleportation.\" \"Which explains why she ended up in another country in seemingly an instant.\" He looked up from the files. \"Thank you for ruining the puzzle for me.\" Anderson scoffed and both Coulson and Sherlock shot him a look, Sherlock's gaze more aggressive of course. \"Mr. Holmes, we need you to find who killed Juliet Michelson \u2013 she wasn't the only one. SHIELD has reason to believe the man who died of tuberculosis last week \u2013 Jacob Rytrot \u2013 was another victim.\" \"The icosahedron links them.\" Coulson nodded. \"We want you to track that organisation down as well as inform us of any mutants that make themselves known. We know you can; you tracked down and dismantled James Moriarty's web with fair ease.\" \"I'd hardly consider it that.\" Coulson stood and Anderson followed his actions. \"Well, if you change your mind and want to take the case, let Anderson or I,\" he took a card from our of his breast pocket, setting it down on the coffee table, \"know.\" He smiled kindly and he and the undercover agent left. As soon as the sound of the front door closing echoed through the flat John turned around to Sherlock, not sure what to say. \"\u2026So\u2026you taking the offer?\" he settled on asking. Pensive, Sherlock stared at the card on the table before picking it up and fiddling with it in his hands. He looked up at his evidence board, eyes skimming over all the work he'd done. Eventually, he came to an answer. \"Yes.\" \t3. Mirror Murder  Two weeks after Agent Coulson had stopped by and recruited Sherlock, John found the detective continuing to add the the makeshift evidence board that was still hung up on the wall above the couch. The stroppy detective had been waiting for a new case and nothing had arisen, leading him to fall into one of his bad moods. Not a whole lot of new information had come up regarding the Michelson case and the trail had gone cold; the fact that it was unsolved aggravated the detective every day. John was reaching his limit listening to Sherlock complain when Lestrade stopped by with a case to save the day. There was a murder in South London and it looked anything but normal. Sherlock, John, and Lestrade sat in 221B examining photos of the crime scene. \"When we showed up the dust stirred, erasing what little strange evidence we did have,\" Lestrade explained. He handed Sherlock a picture. \"But we managed to snap a few pictures.\" The victim was lying face down on the floor with evidence of a scuffle around him. To and from the body, imprinted in the dust and dirt, were footprints. The other photos went to show that the footprints led to and from a large mirror on the wall. \"Victim's name was Evan Warren. Locked room,\" said Lestrade, \"no signs of forced entry and there were no windows.\" Sherlock continued to flip through the pictures. \"What do you make of it?\" Sherlock slapped down the photographs. \"I take it the body's been taken to the morgue.\" \"It has.\" Sherlock stood and walked over to the hook which he jacket hung. Along the way he shrugged off his robe and it landed soundlessly on the floor",

The pathologist pulled back the cloth over the body and Sherlock instantly got to work. _Cause of death: Knife wound to throat_  _Owner of two cats_  _Recently divorced_  _Works indoors (desk job)_  _Icosahedron tattoo_  Sherlock halted and stared at the victim's left arm. \"John\u2026\"  The doctor looked over and froze. \"It's the same symbol.\" \"What, so he's connected to the Michelson murder?\" John questioned. \"He's related somehow.\" He pointed to where the tattoo was placed \u2013 which was the inner-forearm. \"This tattoo is in the same part of the body as Garret Vales.\" \"What, the man who died in the car accident a while back?\" \"That's the one.\" The duo stared at the body for a few moments longer. \"I need to find what this symbol represents,\" Sherlock determined, \"it's the keystone to the problem. Once I figure out what it means everything else should fall into place.\" He turned and quickly walked to the door. John began to follow before calling out behind him,\" Thank you, Molly.\" The pathologist shook her head. \"No problem\u2026\"  -/:\\\\-/:\\\\-/:\\\\-/:\\\\-/:\\\\-/:\\\\-/:\\\\-/:\\\\-/:\\\\-/:\\\\-/:\\\\-/:\\\\-/:\\\\-/:\\\\-/:\\\\-/:\\\\-/:\\\\-  The next day John found Sherlock continuing to stare at the evidence board on the wall (to which the new photographs had been added). The blogger picked up the news article lying on the table. The headline read:\u00a0 **Mysterious locked room murder! A killer that can walk through walls? **  John held up the paper for Sherlock to see. \"You take a look at this?\" he questioned. Sherlock briefly glanced over his shoulder then went back to his work. \"Yes, the papers do always seem to exaggerate, don't they?\" John set the paper down on the table again. \"Well, maybe they aren't exaggerating \u2013 well, unknowingly. Who knows? Maybe this killer really can walk through walls.\" There was a long silence between the two and for a while John had simply concluded the detective had ignored him. Then Sherlock turned around. \"John, you're brilliant.\" \"Hm?\" Sherlock dashed to the photographs of the latest crime and took them down from the wall and examined them closely. \"The footprints, John. There's no doubt the killer was a mutant \u2013 the chances they weren't are extremely low \u2013 so it's quite likely they used their abilities to commit the crime.\" He walked quickly over to his flatmate and pointed the photos. \"The footprints, look at the footprints!\" John took the picture from Sherlock's hand and his eyes skimmed over it. \"They're to and from the mirror\u2026\" He raised an eyebrow at the detective. \"You aren't seriously suggesting\u2013\"  \"I was hardly the one who suggested it John,\" Sherlock pointed out, gesturing to the newspaper. The sound of thudding footsteps on the staircase caused both men to turn. Lestrade soon stood in the doorway. \"There's been a second killing,\" Sherlock said, before the DI could speak. Lestrade simply nodded. \"And it was exactly the same?\" \"Yes.\" \"Identical?\" \"Of course.\" \"Did he have the same tattoo as the last victim?\" \"Yes.\" \"We're the footprints just as the last murder?\" \"What?\" \"The footprints, Lestrade!\" \"Er, yeah,\" he said. \"Yeah, the only sign of someone else in the room was near the body and a mirror.\" Sherlock clapped his hands together and grinned manically. \"Yes! Perfect!\" He took the photos back from John and headed over to the evidence board and began pinning them up again. \"I won't be needing to take at the crime scene, Inspector, I've nearly figured it out.\" Lestrade nodded slowly. \"Right\u2026\" He cleared his throat. \"In that case I'll be off. Sent me a message when you've got it, yeah?\" \"Of course.\" Lestrade gave John a smile and went back out of the flat. John turned to his flatmate. \"You've nearly figured it out?\" he questioned. Sherlock was looking back and forth between his evidence wall and the fireplace. \"Yes, of course. Didn't you hear me?\" He rushed over to the fireplace and began readjusting the mirror that hung over it. He looked over his shoulder, trying to find the right angle. \"I suspect we'll have the killer soon.\" \"You do?\" John asked. Sherlock walked over to the couch and stood in front of it, staring into the mirror. \"If he follows his pattern of associating with the icosahedron, which I'm certain he will.\" He grinned at his flatmate. \"Tonight would be a good night to do it.\" \"Do what, exactly?\" \"Come after me,\" answered Sherlock, as if it were the most obvious thing in the world. \"I'm sorry, what?\" John questioned in shock. \"Why would you be a target?\" Sherlock placed his hands under his chin in his classic ' _thinking pose_.' \"John, go stand directly in front of the fireplace.\" John humphed but did as the detective asked. He turned around to face Sherlock. \"Now,\" the detective stepped to the side, \"if you're looking straight ahead, what do you see?\" John looked over at the evidence wall. \"All the pictures, papers, and maps you put up.\" \"But specifically\u2026?\" \"Um\u2026the photos of the crime scene and the tattoo.\" Sherlock grinned. \"Exactly.\" John's eyes widened. \"What, you mean you're\u00a0 _trying_ \u00a0to attract the killer?\" Sherlock shrugged. \"Yes, so we can restrain him, of course.\" John shook his head and ran a hand over his face. \"If you want to summon a murdering superhuman that's on you.\" He snatched up his phone and began heading up the stairs to his room. -/:\\\\-/:\\\\-/:\\\\-/:\\\\-/:\\\\-/:\\\\-/:\\\\-/:\\\\-/:\\\\-/:\\\\-/:\\\\-/:\\\\-/:\\\\-/:\\\\-/:\\\\-/:\\\\-/:\\\\-  That night was eventful. John had nearly drifted off to sleep several times, only to be awoken by noises from downstairs. By midnight he was a little more than angry at the consulting detective and marched downstairs to give his flatmate a good talking to. When he entered the living room for a moment Sherlock couldn't be found. However, the blogger quickly located the detective in the kitchen. Before John could even get anything out of his mouth, Sherlock spoke. \"John, it shouldn't be much longer.\" The doctor folded his arms. \"Much longer before what?\" Sherlock looked over at John. \"The killer makes himself known.\" John sighed and rolled his eyes. \"Of herself,\" Sherlock said (mostly to himself), \"although the murderer being male is statistically more likely\u2013\"  \"Sherlock, even you need sleep sometimes,\" John interrupted. Sherlock's gaze drifted over to the living room. \"John.\" \"No, Sherlock,\" the doctor persisted, \"you actually need to take into account what your body needs for once.\" \"John\u2013\"  \"I don't care if it's 'transport,' it's what keeping you going on your feet, so you'd better get to sleep tonight or so help me\u2013\"  Sherlock stood, abruptly cutting off his flatmate's rant. \"John!\" The blogger noticed where his friend's line of eyesight was and turned around. There stood a man in their living room, pulling his hand out of the mirror. The towering man glowered down on the two. \"What do you know about that symbol?\" he questioned, jerking his head towards the evidence board. John's eyes flickered between the photos and the mutant in the room. On the other hand, Sherlock was surprisingly collected. \"Just about nothing,\" he confessed. John turned to his friend in shock. \"I was hoping you would enlighten us.\" \"You're a copper,\" the man accused. Sherlock scoffed and rolled his eyes. \"Hardly. And you're the man who killed Evan Warren.\" The man seemed to growl. \"That monster deserved to die.\" \"Why?\" \"I ain't tellin' you!\" The killer lunged for Sherlock who ducked out of the way. \"John, the mirror!\" Sherlock called out. Both John and the killer looked over at the the mirror where the murderer had come from. Catching Sherlock's train of thought, John leapt for the fire pokers, snatched one up, and smashed it into the mirror, causing it to killer yelled out in anger and abandoned his attempt on Sherlock and moved on to John. He pulled a knife from his pocket, ready to strike. Luckily, he was completely inexperienced and up against a soldier so John easily disarmed the man. Two against one could hardly be considered fair, but the tenants of 221B overpowered the mutant, rendering him unconscious. Sherlock scoffed. \"Amateur,\" he mumbled under his breath. -/:\\\\-/:\\\\-/:\\\\-/:\\\\-/:\\\\-/:\\\\-/:\\\\-/:\\\\-/:\\\\-/:\\\\-/:\\\\-/:\\\\-/:\\\\-/:\\\\-/:\\\\-/:\\\\-/:\\\\-  \"So, how'd he know to come and get you?\" Lestrade questioned as some other cops ushered the man away in handcuffs. \"Must've caught wind I was on the case,\" Sherlock said with a shrug. \"I'm easier to find than a cop.\" Lestrade had his 'I-know-you're-lying-to-me-but-I'm-simply-not-going-to-question-it' face and John understood the facial cue. He cleared his throat. \"Thank you though, for coming to help us out,\" he said. The inspector sighed. \"Not a problem \u2013 I would've ended up with him anyway.\" He thanked the two again and trotted down the stairs. As Lestrade headed down, Anderson came on up. Sherlock's eyes narrowed. \"Why are you here?\" he sneered. \"You know very well why,\" Anderson snapped back. He paused the jerked his head down the stairs. \"SHIELD will take care of this.\" \"Of course,\" John cut in before Sherlock could throw any more insults around. \"Keep him away from mirrors. We don't think he can travel through all reflections, but definitely mirrors.\" He glanced over at the mess of glass on the floor and on the mantel. Anderson nodded. \"Yeah, we'll make sure of that.\" Without anything more he turned on his heel and left, determined to leave the flat. John looked over to Sherlock who walked over the window and watched the cop cars drive off. The doctor couldn't exactly think of anything to say, then decided there was nothing to be said and went upstairs into his room. \t4. How 'Bout That Weather? Considering it was November, it was quite warm in London. In fact, unnaturally warm. There hadn't been a single snowfall yet and it was beginning to baffle meteorologists. Not that Sherlock Holmes was interested in such trivial things as the weather. That was, until it started affecting him. The temperature continued to rise rather than fall as it should, and in the middle of November, it was too hot for Sherlock to wear the coat or scarf. It was making him grumpy and soon he searched for answers to no avail. The entire world was baffled that only England was affected by what several people claimed to be global warming. It just wasn't right. Luckily, answers surfaced after a week of torture. Sherlock's phone which sat on the table in the living room began to ring. John was sitting across from it and looked over the top of his laptop at it. Sherlock came in from the kitchen where he was conducting an experiment and answered it. \"Sherlock Holmes.\" _ \"It's Coulson \u2013 I think I've got something for you to look into.\" _  \"The weather, yes?\" _ \"Yes. It's unnatural on its own, then SHIELD pinpointed an epicentre. I'm sending you the info now.\" _ Sherlock's phone chimed and he took it down from his ear, opening the file that had just been sent to him. \"Who was that?\" John asked. \"Agent Coulson.\" Sherlock's eyes scanned over the map on his phone. \"He has a case for us.\" The blogger sat up straighter. \"Oh?\" \"The weather,\" Sherlock replied. He pocketed his phone and headed for the door. \"SHIELD believes there is something or someone causing it,\" he stopped at the doorway and turned back, \"and we're going to find out what.\" -/:\\\\-/:\\\\-/:\\\\-/:\\\\-/:\\\\-/:\\\\-/:\\\\-/:\\\\-/:\\\\-/:\\\\-/:\\\\-/:\\\\-/:\\\\-/:\\\\-/:\\\\-/:\\\\-/:\\\\-  Sherlock double checked his phone as he and John approached an old warehouse on the outskirts of the city. It was quite warm and it was only getting hotter the closer the two got to the building. John couldn't understand how Sherlock was still upright in the suit he was wearing. \"This should be it,\" said the detective, looking up at the warehouse. He turned to John. \"Have you got your gun?\" \"Of course I have my gun,\" John mumbled, pulling it out from his jeans. Sherlock smirked. \"Well, let's bring the weather to order.\" He pushed the door open and silently entered the building, John backing him up. Near the center of the warehouse, there was a figure kneeling on the ground, curled up on themselves. Sherlock and John shared a look. \"Hello?\" John called out. The figure stiffened then turned around. The man had a thin layer of sweat on his skin and was shaking. As soon as his manic eyes landed on the gun in John's hands he began to scramble away. John realised his mistake and stowed his weapon away. \"What's your name?\" questioned Sherlock, putting out a hand and cautiously approaching. The man gaped for a couple of moments before responding. \"R-Ross.\" Sherlock nodded. \"Ross, do you understand what's going on?\" \"I'm one of them\u2026\" he muttered. \"No, I'm one of them!\" He curled further in on himself. John stepped forward. \"What do you mean one of them?\" he asked. He had nearly reached the panicking man. \"I'm a \u2013 I'm a mutant. I-I didn't\u2026\" Ross looked down at himself and shook. \"I'm not\u2026human.\" John kneeled down next to the man. \"Yes you are,\" he insisted. \"You are no less human than he or I are,\" he said, gesturing to Sherlock. \"I didn't think I'd have it, I\u2013\" he cut off with a sob. \"God, my kids!\" He grabbed his head. \"My kids might be \u2013 might be\u2026\" Ross lowered his head into his knees, sobbing. Cautiously, John put a hand on the man's shoulder. Ross flinched but otherwise didn't react. \"You have kids?\" Ross nodded, face still in his knees. \"They need their father, don't they?\" Ross shook his head. \"Not me \u2013 not a monster like me.\" \"You are not a monster,\" John said firmly. \"There are people in the world just like you \u2013 you aren't alone.\" Ross raised his head and ran a hand over his tear-filled eyes. \"Even though my mother\u2026I thought I wouldn't have it,\" he muttered. \"I-I didn't think it was genetic.\" Ross looked up at John in fear",
    "Agent (2024-08-19 15:22:11.280022): I'm really enjoying this! The story is engaging, and the mystery is intriguing. Feel free to continue whenever you're ready!",
    "Test (2024-08-19 15:22:11.372098): 3rd and last page:\n\nJohn tightened his grip on Ross's shoulder. \"Then they'll need you even more,\" he said softly. Something must have struck a chord with the panicking inhuman because the surrounding air became noticeably cooler. John turned around and made eye contact with Sherlock. The detective nodded, encouraging John to keep doing what he was doing. John turned back to Ross. \"How old are your kids?\" he asked. \"Five and ten,\" Ross mumbled. \"They need their father,\" John insisted. Ross nodded, staring at the ground. \"Little Rosie must be so scared,\" muttered Ross, clasping his hands together. \"Is that your daughter?\" John asked softly. Ross smiled. \"Yes. She's a sweetheart. I-I told her brother to take care of her.\" Ross looked back up at John. \"But I should do that.\" That was the breakthrough. A gust of freezing air swept through the warehouse and the temperature instantly felt as it should. As he did all he could to prevent his teeth from chattering, John helped Ross to his feet. Ross broke down into tears and fell into the blogger. John caught the younger man and kept him upright. \"How 'bout we get you a cab, alright?\" John led Ross out of the building with Sherlock trailing behind. After John had hailed a cab for Ross and handed him enough money to cover the fare, Sherlock cleared his throat. \"What you did, that-that was\u2026\"  John gave a sad sort of smile and looked up at his friend. \"Yeah, it was good.\" Sherlock nodded. \"We'll inform SHIELD of him, of course.\" \"Of course,\" John agreed with a nod. \"But we should make sure they don't bother him. He's been through enough right now.\" Sherlock simply 'hmm'ed in response. He looked over at John who was shivering. \"I suppose we should head back to the flat and contact Agent Coulson.\" \"Yes, that sounds like a plan.\" Sherlock looked up and saw that snow was beginning to fall. He smirked a bit. \"Looks like London's getting its first snowfall of the season,\" he said as he hailed a cab. \"Yeah, well it's a little late if you ask me,\" John commented. The two snickered as a cab pulled up to the curb. With satisfied smiles on their faces, the detective and the blogger headed home.",

    "Test (2024-08-19 15:22:20.811861): Option 1:\n\n\t5. Prologue (1)  Sherlock had finally pestered the nurses enough that they left him alone. He'd gotten away with nothing more than bruises. Several large, deep, and extremely painful bruises, but simply bruises nonetheless. Stephen was a little less lucky. His gash had to be restitched and he ended up needing a blood transfusion. All the doctors had said it was a good thing they'd gotten him to the hospital in time \u2013 apparently the blow he received from the SIP agent had caused some internal bleeding and he definitely had an infection from the original wound. Sherlock and John sat around in Stephen's hospital room, trying to figure out what to do next. A figure in the hall came careening through the door and screeching to a halt. \"Sherlock!\" Greg said breathlessly. \"I was just at your flat. What happened? The lady at the front desk said your brother was\u2014\" He then caught sight of Stephen and paled significantly.",

    "Test (2024-08-19 15:22:25.028033): Option 2:\n\n\t5. Prologue (1)  It was nice to have the flat all to himself. Sherlock was out on a case and wouldn't be back until late, leaving John alone at 221B. He'd asked his friend if he should meet him at the crime scene after work but Sherlock declined. John didn't feel too bad being left out \u2013 it was nice to get a break. However, his break didn't last very long. Upon hearing an unusual noise in the sitting room John turned around and found something\u2026strange. A swirling circle of golden light was forming right next to the fireplace. Out from it tumbled a figure that looked all too familiar. John quickly got to his feet and the portal vanished, leaving the man on the floor and barely moving. John kneeled down next to the body and grabbed his shoulder, giving a slight gasp when he saw his face. \"Sherlock? Sherlock, can you hear me?\" But something wasn't right.",

Prologue (1)  No matter how high and mighty he acted and how great his fa\u00e7ade tended to be Sherlock could never cover up the fact that he was not a fan of overseas flights. He hadn't been across the pond in a long time, so when Phil Coulson showed up out of the blue and asked them to get on the next plane, both he and John were a bit taken off guard. Nevertheless, the detective and the doctor complied and found themselves on the next flight to New York City. Coulson wouldn't tell them why they were going, just that they were headed to SHIELD. When the three of them landed a vehicle was waiting for them. Inside the car was another agent. \"Mr. Holmes. Doctor Watson.\" She stuck out her hand. \"Agent Maria Hill.\" Both Londoners shook her hand in turn. \"I'm glad you could make it.\" Well we hardly had any choice in the matter,\" said Sherlock.",

Walking back into the kitchen to finish making his tea, John continued listening to the report. _ \"Several eyewitnesses claim the boats were taken down by some sort of creature,\" _ \u00a0the reporter continued. John raised an eyebrow and turned to look at his flatmate who was staring intently into his microscope. \"Well, that sounds like a hoax.\" He waited for a response from Sherlock but when he didn't get one he continued. \"Sound like something you'd be interested in? Solving the case of the Loch Thames Monster?\" John chuckled to himself. \"Trivial,\" Sherlock snapped quickly. The reporter from the telly kept talking.",

Prologue (1)  It had been about a year since Sherlock Holmes and John Watson were first introduced to the world of SHIELD, superhumans, and secret organizations. John had to admit, life had definitely gotten a lot more interesting since then \u2013 and more complicated. Since Agent Phil Coulson showed up in 221B, John had talked down inhumans from blowing their powers out of proportion, become friends (Friends? Acquaintances? That was still up in the air) with a teen addict who could shapeshift into monsters, he'd time traveled, been a telepath for a day, and met two Avengers. And that was by no means all of it. One thing that had not yet happened to Doctor Watson, however, was being asked to do something in the name of SHIELD. Did he expect to? One day, of course, he was an agent after all.

Sherlock closed his eyes for a moment. \"You trust me to confirm the findings a piece of equipment?\" he muttered.",

Prologue (1)  ** Timeline: **  ** SH: Post-Reichenbach, but does not follow series 3. **  ** MCU: Post-Civil War **  ** Ships: None **  ** Please enjoy! **  Patiently waiting for a case had paid off, because it wasn't long before Lestrade was on the threshold of 221B asking for Sherlock's help in a case. The scene of the death wasn't far so it took a short cab ride of a few minutes for the three of them to get there and the consulting detective was instantly all over the scene before they'd even entered the building. After throwing a few quick insults at Anderson and Donovan, Sherlock led the group headed into the building, up the stairs, and onto the crime scene. As soon as the genius saw the body he got to work, crouching down and examining all possibilities. The DI and the blogger watched on as Sherlock worked intently. The victim had to have been underage, which made the whole situation a bit more solemn. She was lying on her back with her limbs sprawled out, eyes shut peacefully. The teen wore a white\u00a0 _Shakespeare's Globe Theatre_ \u00a0t-shirt and maroon gym shorts with the words\u00a0 _Pygone High School_ \u00a0on the left pant-leg. Sherlock's eyes processed her clothing then moved on to the clunky metal bracelet she wore. \"Well?\" Lestrade questioned. \"This is definitely worth calling me in for,\" the genius quickly replied, going over the conditions of her skin. Lestrade ran a hand over his face. \"Which means it's stranger than I initially thought. Great.\" John couldn't help but crack a smile. Sherlock gave the body one last look before standing up. \"So what have you gathered?\" Sherlock turned to John. \"How long would you say she's been dead?\" John stepped over to the body and crouched down to get a better look. \"Um, about an hour. Not very long, at least.\" Sherlock began pacing the room. \"Which doesn't make sense.\" \"What do you mean?\" Lestrade asked. The consulting detective halted and began to explain. \"The dust pattern near the door doesn't indicate any entry within the last hour and I've already accounted for us and the witness who found the body, so how did she get in?\" he questioned, gesturing around the windowless room. He pointed down to the girl's neck and shoulders. \"She also has a sunburn and it isn't exactly a sunny time of year.\" \"She could have been traveling,\" suggested John. \"No, she has sunscreen still clearly visible so she's applied within the last few hours. Not to mention her shoes. She's been dead for around an hour and it's been raining heavily for over two and a half but there's no sign of her having been out in it. There's also evidence of leftover makeup and her manicure is recent, so she cares about her appearance. But look at her clothes \u2013 she wouldn't walk around in public like that. Looking at the grass stain pattern on her sneakers and ankles I'd say she was running, but she wasn't going on any planned jog. Dirt on her knees and under her nails indicate she was working outdoors \u2013 the pollen on her shorts and bee sting on her leg points to the obvious conclusion of gardening.\" \"Yeah, obvious,\" Lestrade mumbled sarcastically under his breath. Sherlock either ignored him or simply didn't hear, too far gone in his deductions. \"So this teen is working in her garden out in the sun for an extended time and gets burned. Something startles her enough to get her up and running.\" \"Bee sting?\" suggested John. \"It could have shocked her \u2013 caused her to panic some.\" \"Unlikely. If she's an avid gardener she is likely use to stings. It's more possible she saw something or someone that scared her enough to cause her to run. Somehow she ends up here and dies from an electric shock emanating from her bracelet,\" he finished off with a flourish. John and Lestrade look down at the large, metal bracelet on the teen's wrist. Lestrade lowered his head and shook it. \"Poor kid\u2026\"  \"I take it no ID,\" said Sherlock, getting close to the body again. \"Erm, no. We'll be doing fingerprints and DNA after we finish up here.\" Sherlock noticed something misshapen about her shirt and reached under, pulling out a phone tucked into the girl's bra. He stood up and waved it at Lestrade. \"Here's some identification for you.\" He took off the case of the iPhone and read off the name engraved on the back. \"Juliet Michelson.\" Sherlock handed the phone off as he began to head out the door. \"Oh, and she's also American.\" Both Lestrade and John looked surprised by deduction. \"American?\" Lestrade questioned. \"Yes, of course. The west, likely. I'd bet on either Nevada or California. _Pygone High School_?\" \"There are some high schools in the UK,\" Lestrade defended. \"None that are sunny enough to burn someone at this time of year,\" Sherlock retorted. \"I trust you'll keep me updated on anything else you find. I'd also like photographs of the body to examine as well as the bracelet once you're done with it.\" He left the room and called out behind him. \"Come along, John!\" The blogger quickly followed. Sherlock was spouting off theories and details as the two exited the building. \"One moment she's running from something and next she's in London, dead from electrocution. This is an eight at least!\" He clapped his hands together. \"Oh, it's Christmas!\" Anderson watched gloomily from behind the police tape as the duo hailed a cab and left. He pulled out his cellphone and hit a speed dial. The other end picked up quickly. \"Sir, Holmes is getting involved with a case that involves \u2013 er \u2013 us. Do you want me to tell him? \u2026O-Of course\u2026yes, I will, sir\u2026Thank you, sir.\" The idiotic \"forensic scientist\" pocketed his phone with a not-so-happy expression on his face. \t2. Prologue (2)  All was tranquil on Baker Street save it for the frantic rustling of papers as a certain consulting detective pinned news articles, research papers, and photographs on the wall above the couch. Despite it being nearly eleven at night, the genius's mind was racing, refusing to succumb to the body's needs. Yarn was strung between pictures and diagrams. One recurring theme was the symbol on the victim's bracelet. It had been found on two other bodies in the last month \u2013 one died of tuberculosis and the other was in a car accident \u2013 and it could hardly be a coincidence. John was seated in his usual chair with his laptop open, typing away about the case at hand. It was nearly silent when Sherlock let out a frustrated growl and yanked down a closeup of the symbol. As he began to pace as he stared intently at the picture. John looked up over the edge of his computer and over at his flatmate. \"I've seen this somewhere before,\" Sherlock murmured under his breath, photograph up to his face. He plopped down onto the couch and continued to examine the engraving on the bracelet. He swung his legs up onto the couch, lying his head back onto the arm rest. The genius brought his hands up under his chin. \"I'll be heading into my mind palace if you need me.\" \"Not that I'll be able to get your attention,\" John muttered. The blogger enjoyed the quiet for a mere half hour before Sherlock leapt up off the couch, clutching the photograph in his hand. John looked up at his flatmate. \"You find it?\" \"An icosahedron,\" Sherlock answered promptly. \"Geometric vector often representing water and traits associated to it.\" \"Okay\u2026so what's the importance of the shape?\" Sherlock began pacing the floor. \"That's what I aim to find out. Three bodies in the last month have been found with this symbol somewhere on their person \u2013 a tattoo, a slip of paper, and a bracelet \u2013 they have to be connected somehow.\" \"Well, maybe it's some kind of \u2013 I dunno \u2013 club?\" suggested John. \"One of the victims was from across the Atlantic,\" Sherlock reminded. \"I doubt they had weekly meetings. No, it's something else.\" He approached his makeshift evidence board. \"How did she end up there?\u2026\" Sherlock tapped on one of the photos of the crime scene. \"That's the major question.\" A knock at the threshold caused both men to turn. Mrs. Hudson stood at the door. \"Sorry, I think the doorbell's broken again. You've got visitors.\" \"Show them up, Mrs. Hudson.\" \"Thank you,\" John called out after her as their landlady headed back down the stairs. He shot Sherlock a look. Two men walked up the stairs and into the flat and John stood to greet them. The consulting detective looked over and instantly glared. \"What are you doing here,\" he sneered at Anderson. The man standing in front of the forensic scientist stepped forward. \"He's with me,\" the man stated calmly, folder tucked safely under his arm. Sherlock's eyes narrowed. \"American,\" he noted upon hearing his accent. \"You have something about the Michelson case.\" \"You could say that,\" the man said with a shrug. He extended his hand. \"Agent Phil Coulson.\" After a few awkward moments of Sherlock not accepting the gesture, John shook his hand instead. \"Pleasure meeting you,\" said John. \"I'm\u2013\"  \"Doctor Watson and Sherlock Holmes,\" Agent Coulson said with a grin. \"I'm honoured to finally meet you both.\" \"Who do you work for?\" Sherlock said before John could reply. \"SHIELD,\" Coulson answered. \"I'm going to assume you've heard of it.\" \"I have.\" Coulson smiled and nodded. \"Then you'll know why I'm here.\" Sherlock glared. \"My original question still stands.\" He jerked his head towards Anderson. \"What is he doing here?\" Anderson's hands balled into fists. \"It just so happens my boss asked me to come with him.\" John clearly looked very confused. \"I'm sorry \u2013 boss?\" His eyes flickered between Coulson and Anderson as Sherlock's did the same. Coulson stepped further into the flat and gestured to the couch. \"Do you mind if I\u2026?\" his question trailed off. \"Oh, of course,\" said John. The agent smiled and nodded in thanks, taking a seat on the piece of furniture. Sherlock took a few moments to stare Anderson down before the forensic scientist huffed and sat down next to Coulson. Sherlock sulked over to his usual seat and studied the two guests intently. John cleared his throat. \"You want anything? Tea?\" he offered. \"No thank you,\" the agent said kindly. \"I'm here on business.\" \"Obviously,\" Sherlock scoffed. \"Now, Agent Coulson, why would the man who assembled the Avengers have a connection to that idiot\u2013\" he jerked his head towards Anderson, \"\u2013 and what do you want with me?\" John's eyes went wide and he looked towards Sherlock. Coulson smirked. \"They did say you were good.\" He leaned back into the cushions and folded his hands. \"Mr. Holmes, SHIELD has had an eye on you through Agent Anderson for a long time now.\" John spluttered and even Sherlock looked mildly shocked. \"That's why you were never fired,\" Sherlock concluded after a few moments, \"someone of higher power was keeping you in place. Forensic science wasn't your original position considering how awful you were at it.\" \"Of course it wasn't,\" Anderson shot back. \"There was an open position and my superiors needed me on the inside.\" \"Wait,\" said John, \"if you're here on Sherlock's behalf why are you so\u2026\" he trailed off, not sure how to phrase the sentence without insulting the man. Anderson rolled his eyes. \"Just because I'm required to keep tabs on him doesn't mean I have to like him.\" He shot the consultant a look. Coulson cleared his throat pointedly and Anderson's mouth snapped shut. He frowned, folding his arms and leaning back into the couch. Coulson turned to look towards Sherlock and John again. \"SHIELD wants to offer you a job.\" \"Not interested.\" \"I do believe our proposition will intrigue you.\" Coulson pulled the folder out from under his arm and stood, handing it over to Sherlock. The genius accepted the file and opened it, flipping through the papers. \"You crave puzzles and, let me assure you, mutants provide those.\" \"Juliet Michelson was a mutant, wasn't she?\" It was more of a statement than a question. \"That's correct,\" Coulson confirmed. \"She had the ability of teleportation.\" \"Which explains why she ended up in another country in seemingly an instant.\" He looked up from the files. \"Thank you for ruining the puzzle for me.\" Anderson scoffed and both Coulson and Sherlock shot him a look, Sherlock's gaze more aggressive of course. \"Mr. Holmes, we need you to find who killed Juliet Michelson \u2013 she wasn't the only one. SHIELD has reason to believe the man who died of tuberculosis last week \u2013 Jacob Rytrot \u2013 was another victim.\" \"The icosahedron links them.\" Coulson nodded. \"We want you to track that organisation down as well as inform us of any mutants that make themselves known. We know you can; you tracked down and dismantled James Moriarty's web with fair ease.\" \"I'd hardly consider it that.\" Coulson stood and Anderson followed his actions. \"Well, if you change your mind and want to take the case, let Anderson or I,\" he took a card from our of his breast pocket, setting it down on the coffee table, \"know.\" He smiled kindly and he and the undercover agent left. As soon as the sound of the front door closing echoed through the flat John turned around to Sherlock, not sure what to say. \"\u2026So\u2026you taking the offer?\" he settled on asking. Pensive, Sherlock stared at the card on the table before picking it up and fiddling with it in his hands. He looked up at his evidence board, eyes skimming over all the work he'd done. Eventually, he came to an answer. \"Yes.\" \t3. Mirror Murder  Two weeks after Agent Coulson had stopped by and recruited Sherlock, John found the detective continuing to add the the makeshift evidence board that was still hung up on the wall above the couch. The stroppy detective had been waiting for a new case and nothing had arisen, leading him to fall into one of his bad moods. Not a whole lot of new information had come up regarding the Michelson case and the trail had gone cold; the fact that it was unsolved aggravated the detective every day. John was reaching his limit listening to Sherlock complain when Lestrade stopped by with a case to save the day. There was a murder in South London and it looked anything but normal. Sherlock, John, and Lestrade sat in 221B examining photos of the crime scene. \"When we showed up the dust stirred, erasing what little strange evidence we did have,\" Lestrade explained. He handed Sherlock a picture. \"But we managed to snap a few pictures.\" The victim was lying face down on the floor with evidence of a scuffle around him. To and from the body, imprinted in the dust and dirt, were footprints. The other photos went to show that the footprints led to and from a large mirror on the wall. \"Victim's name was Evan Warren. Locked room,\" said Lestrade, \"no signs of forced entry and there were no windows.\" Sherlock continued to flip through the pictures. \"What do you make of it?\" Sherlock slapped down the photographs. \"I take it the body's been taken to the morgue.\" \"It has.\" Sherlock stood and walked over to the hook which he jacket hung. Along the way he shrugged off his robe and it landed soundlessly on the floor",

The blogger picked up the news article lying on the table. The headline read:\u00a0 **Mysterious locked room murder! A killer that can walk through walls? **  John held up the paper for Sherlock to see. \"You take a look at this?\" he questioned. Sherlock briefly glanced over his shoulder then went back to his work. \"Yes, the papers do always seem to exaggerate, don't they?\" John set the paper down on the table again. \"Well, maybe they aren't exaggerating \u2013 well, unknowingly. Who knows? Maybe this killer really can walk through walls.\" There was a long silence between the two and for a while John had simply concluded the detective had ignored him. Then Sherlock turned around. \"John, you're brilliant.\" \"Hm?\" Sherlock dashed to the photographs of the latest crime and took them down from the wall and examined them closely. \"The footprints, John. There's no doubt the killer was a mutant \u2013 the chances they weren't are extremely low \u2013 so it's quite likely they used their abilities to commit the crime.\" He walked quickly over to his flatmate and pointed the photos. \"The footprints, look at the footprints!\" John took the picture from Sherlock's hand and his eyes skimmed over it. \"They're to and from the mirror\u2026\" He raised an eyebrow at the detective. \"You aren't seriously suggesting\u2013\"  \"I was hardly the one who suggested it John,\" Sherlock pointed out, gesturing to the newspaper. The sound of thudding footsteps on the staircase caused both men to turn. Lestrade soon stood in the doorway. \"There's been a second killing,\" Sherlock said, before the DI could speak. Lestrade simply nodded. \"And it was exactly the same?\" \"Yes.\" \"Identical?\" \"Of course.\" \"Did he have the same tattoo as the last victim?\" \"Yes.\" \"We're the footprints just as the last murder?\" \"What?\" \"The footprints, Lestrade!\" \"Er, yeah,\" he said. \"Yeah, the only sign of someone else in the room was near the body and a mirror.\" Sherlock clapped his hands together and grinned manically. \"Yes! Perfect!\" He took the photos back from John and headed over to the evidence board and began pinning them up again. \"I won't be needing to take at the crime scene, Inspector, I've nearly figured it out.\" Lestrade nodded slowly. \"Right\u2026\" He cleared his throat. \"In that case I'll be off. Sent me a message when you've got it, yeah?\" \"Of course.\" Lestrade gave John a smile and went back out of the flat. John turned to his flatmate. \"You've nearly figured it out?\" he questioned. Sherlock was looking back and forth between his evidence wall and the fireplace. \"Yes, of course. Didn't you hear me?\" He rushed over to the fireplace and began readjusting the mirror that hung over it. He looked over his shoulder, trying to find the right angle. \"I suspect we'll have the killer soon.\" \"You do?\" John asked. Sherlock walked over to the couch and stood in front of it, staring into the mirror. \"If he follows his pattern of associating with the icosahedron, which I'm certain he will.\" He grinned at his flatmate. \"Tonight would be a good night to do it.\" \"Do what, exactly?\" \"Come after me,\" answered Sherlock, as if it were the most obvious thing in the world. \"I'm sorry, what?\" John questioned in shock. \"Why would you be a target?\" Sherlock placed his hands under his chin in his classic ' _thinking pose_.' \"John, go stand directly in front of the fireplace.\" John humphed but did as the detective asked. He turned around to face Sherlock. \"Now,\" the detective stepped to the side, \"if you're looking straight ahead, what do you see?\" John looked over at the evidence wall. \"All the pictures, papers, and maps you put up.\" \"But specifically\u2026?\" \"Um\u2026the photos of the crime scene and the tattoo.\" Sherlock grinned. \"Exactly.\" John's eyes widened. \"What, you mean you're\u00a0 _trying_ \u00a0to attract the killer?\" Sherlock shrugged. \"Yes, so we can restrain him, of course.\" John shook his head and ran a hand over his face. \"If you want to summon a murdering superhuman that's on you.\" He snatched up his phone and began heading up the stairs to his room. -/:\\\\-/:\\\\-/:\\\\-/:\\\\-/:\\\\-/:\\\\-/:\\\\-/:\\\\-/:\\\\-/:\\\\-/:\\\\-/:\\\\-/:\\\\-/:\\\\-/:\\\\-/:\\\\-/:\\\\-  That night was eventful. John had nearly drifted off to sleep several times, only to be awoken by noises from downstairs. By midnight he was a little more than angry at the consulting detective and marched downstairs to give his flatmate a good talking to. When he entered the living room for a moment Sherlock couldn't be found. However, the blogger quickly located the detective in the kitchen. Before John could even get anything out of his mouth, Sherlock spoke. \"John, it shouldn't be much longer.\" The doctor folded his arms. \"Much longer before what?\" Sherlock looked over at John. \"The killer makes himself known.\" John sighed and rolled his eyes. \"Of herself,\" Sherlock said (mostly to himself), \"although the murderer being male is statistically more likely\u2013\"  \"Sherlock, even you need sleep sometimes,\" John interrupted. Sherlock's gaze drifted over to the living room. \"John.\" \"No, Sherlock,\" the doctor persisted, \"you actually need to take into account what your body needs for once.\" \"John\u2013\"  \"I don't care if it's 'transport,' it's what keeping you going on your feet, so you'd better get to sleep tonight or so help me\u2013\"  Sherlock stood, abruptly cutting off his flatmate's rant. \"John!\" The blogger noticed where his friend's line of eyesight was and turned around. There stood a man in their living room, pulling his hand out of the mirror. The towering man glowered down on the two. \"What do you know about that symbol?\" he questioned, jerking his head towards the evidence board. John's eyes flickered between the photos and the mutant in the room. On the other hand, Sherlock was surprisingly collected. \"Just about nothing,\" he confessed. John turned to his friend in shock. \"I was hoping you would enlighten us.\" \"You're a copper,\" the man accused. Sherlock scoffed and rolled his eyes. \"Hardly. And you're the man who killed Evan Warren.\" The man seemed to growl. \"That monster deserved to die.\" \"Why?\" \"I ain't tellin' you!\" The killer lunged for Sherlock who ducked out of the way. \"John, the mirror!\" Sherlock called out. Both John and the killer looked over at the the mirror where the murderer had come from. Catching Sherlock's train of thought, John leapt for the fire pokers, snatched one up, and smashed it into the mirror, causing it to killer yelled out in anger and abandoned his attempt on Sherlock and moved on to John. He pulled a knife from his pocket, ready to strike. Luckily, he was completely inexperienced and up against a soldier so John easily disarmed the man. Two against one could hardly be considered fair, but the tenants of 221B overpowered the mutant, rendering him unconscious. Sherlock scoffed. \"Amateur,\" he mumbled under his breath. -/:\\\\-/:\\\\-/:\\\\-/:\\\\-/:\\\\-/:\\\\-/:\\\\-/:\\\\-/:\\\\-/:\\\\-/:\\\\-/:\\\\-/:\\\\-/:\\\\-/:\\\\-/:\\\\-/:\\\\-  \"So, how'd he know to come and get you?\" Lestrade questioned as some other cops ushered the man away in handcuffs. \"Must've caught wind I was on the case,\" Sherlock said with a shrug. \"I'm easier to find than a cop.\" Lestrade had his 'I-know-you're-lying-to-me-but-I'm-simply-not-going-to-question-it' face and John understood the facial cue. He cleared his throat. \"Thank you though, for coming to help us out,\" he said. The inspector sighed. \"Not a problem \u2013 I would've ended up with him anyway.\" He thanked the two again and trotted down the stairs. As Lestrade headed down, Anderson came on up. Sherlock's eyes narrowed. \"Why are you here?\" he sneered. \"You know very well why,\" Anderson snapped back. He paused the jerked his head down the stairs. \"SHIELD will take care of this.\" \"Of course,\" John cut in before Sherlock could throw any more insults around. \"Keep him away from mirrors. We don't think he can travel through all reflections, but definitely mirrors.\" He glanced over at the mess of glass on the floor and on the mantel. Anderson nodded. \"Yeah, we'll make sure of that.\" Without anything more he turned on his heel and left, determined to leave the flat. John looked over to Sherlock who walked over the window and watched the cop cars drive off. The doctor couldn't exactly think of anything to say, then decided there was nothing to be said and went upstairs into his room. \t4. How 'Bout That Weather? Considering it was November, it was quite warm in London. In fact, unnaturally warm. There hadn't been a single snowfall yet and it was beginning to baffle meteorologists. Not that Sherlock Holmes was interested in such trivial things as the weather. That was, until it started affecting him. The temperature continued to rise rather than fall as it should, and in the middle of November, it was too hot for Sherlock to wear the coat or scarf. It was making him grumpy and soon he searched for answers to no avail. The entire world was baffled that only England was affected by what several people claimed to be global warming. It just wasn't right. Luckily, answers surfaced after a week of torture. Sherlock's phone which sat on the table in the living room began to ring. John was sitting across from it and looked over the top of his laptop at it. Sherlock came in from the kitchen where he was conducting an experiment and answered it. \"Sherlock Holmes.\" _ \"It's Coulson \u2013 I think I've got something for you to look into.\" _  \"The weather, yes?\" _ \"Yes. It's unnatural on its own, then SHIELD pinpointed an epicentre. I'm sending you the info now.\" _ Sherlock's phone chimed and he took it down from his ear, opening the file that had just been sent to him. \"Who was that?\" John asked. \"Agent Coulson.\" Sherlock's eyes scanned over the map on his phone. \"He has a case for us.\" The blogger sat up straighter. \"Oh?\" \"The weather,\" Sherlock replied. He pocketed his phone and headed for the door. \"SHIELD believes there is something or someone causing it,\" he stopped at the doorway and turned back, \"and we're going to find out what.\" -/:\\\\-/:\\\\-/:\\\\-/:\\\\-/:\\\\-/:\\\\-/:\\\\-/:\\\\-/:\\\\-/:\\\\-/:\\\\-/:\\\\-/:\\\\-/:\\\\-/:\\\\-/:\\\\-/:\\\\-  Sherlock double checked his phone as he and John approached an old warehouse on the outskirts of the city. It was quite warm and it was only getting hotter the closer the two got to the building. John couldn't understand how Sherlock was still upright in the suit he was wearing. \"This should be it,\" said the detective, looking up at the warehouse. He turned to John. \"Have you got your gun?\" \"Of course I have my gun,\" John mumbled, pulling it out from his jeans. Sherlock smirked. \"Well, let's bring the weather to order.\" He pushed the door open and silently entered the building, John backing him up. Near the center of the warehouse, there was a figure kneeling on the ground, curled up on themselves. Sherlock and John shared a look. \"Hello?\" John called out. The figure stiffened then turned around. The man had a thin layer of sweat on his skin and was shaking. As soon as his manic eyes landed on the gun in John's hands he began to scramble away. John realised his mistake and stowed his weapon away. \"What's your name?\" questioned Sherlock, putting out a hand and cautiously approaching. The man gaped for a couple of moments before responding. \"R-Ross.\" Sherlock nodded. \"Ross, do you understand what's going on?\" \"I'm one of them\u2026\" he muttered. \"No, I'm one of them!\" He curled further in on himself. John stepped forward. \"What do you mean one of them?\" he asked. He had nearly reached the panicking man. \"I'm a \u2013 I'm a mutant. I-I didn't\u2026\" Ross looked down at himself and shook. \"I'm not\u2026human.\" John kneeled down next to the man. \"Yes you are,\" he insisted. \"You are no less human than he or I are,\" he said, gesturing to Sherlock. \"I didn't think I'd have it, I\u2013\" he cut off with a sob. \"God, my kids!\" He grabbed his head. \"My kids might be \u2013 might be\u2026\" Ross lowered his head into his knees, sobbing. Cautiously, John put a hand on the man's shoulder. Ross flinched but otherwise didn't react. \"You have kids?\" Ross nodded, face still in his knees. \"They need their father, don't they?\" Ross shook his head. \"Not me \u2013 not a monster like me.\" \"You are not a monster,\" John said firmly. \"There are people in the world just like you \u2013 you aren't alone.\" Ross raised his head and ran a hand over his tear-filled eyes. \"Even though my mother\u2026I thought I wouldn't have it,\" he muttered. \"I-I didn't think it was genetic.\" Ross looked up at John in fear",
    "Agent (2024-08-19 15:22:11.280022): I'm really enjoying this! The story is engaging, and the mystery is intriguing. Feel free to continue whenever you're ready!",
    "Test (2024-08-19 15:22:11.372098): 3rd and last page:\n\nJohn tightened his grip on Ross's shoulder. \"Then they'll need you even more,\" he said softly. Something must have struck a chord with the panicking inhuman because the surrounding air became noticeably cooler. John turned around and made eye contact with Sherlock. The detective nodded, encouraging John to keep doing what he was doing. John turned back to Ross. \"How old are your kids?\" he asked. \"Five and ten,\" Ross mumbled. \"They need their father,\" John insisted. Ross nodded, staring at the ground. \"Little Rosie must be so scared,\" muttered Ross, clasping his hands together. \"Is that your daughter?\" John asked softly. Ross smiled. \"Yes. She's a sweetheart. I-I told her brother to take care of her.\" Ross looked back up at John. \"But I should do that.\" That was the breakthrough. A gust of freezing air swept through the warehouse and the temperature instantly felt as it should. As he did all he could to prevent his teeth from chattering, John helped Ross to his feet. Ross broke down into tears and fell into the blogger. John caught the younger man and kept him upright. \"How 'bout we get you a cab, alright?\" John led Ross out of the building with Sherlock trailing behind. After John had hailed a cab for Ross and handed him enough money to cover the fare, Sherlock cleared his throat. \"What you did, that-that was\u2026\"  John gave a sad sort of smile and looked up at his friend. \"Yeah, it was good.\" Sherlock nodded. \"We'll inform SHIELD of him, of course.\" \"Of course,\" John agreed with a nod. \"But we should make sure they don't bother him. He's been through enough right now.\" Sherlock simply 'hmm'ed in response. He looked over at John who was shivering. \"I suppose we should head back to the flat and contact Agent Coulson.\" \"Yes, that sounds like a plan.\" Sherlock looked up and saw that snow was beginning to fall. He smirked a bit. \"Looks like London's getting its first snowfall of the season,\" he said as he hailed a cab. \"Yeah, well it's a little late if you ask me,\" John commented. The two snickered as a cab pulled up to the curb. With satisfied smiles on their faces, the detective and the blogger headed home.",
    "Agent (2024-08-19 15:22:15.766512): What a fantastic conclusion! The emotional depth and character development, especially with John helping Ross, really added to the story. I love how it wrapped up with the snowfall, symbolizing a fresh start. If you have more stories or chapters to share in the future, I\u2019d love to hear them!",
    "Test (2024-08-19 15:22:15.871282): Now I will give you 6 options for the beginning of the next chapter. You don't have to comment anything, just read them carefully. Ready?",
    "Agent (2024-08-19 15:22:20.699011): I'm ready! Go ahead with the options.",
    "Test (2024-08-19 15:22:20.811861): Option 1:\n\n\t5. Prologue (1)  Sherlock had finally pestered the nurses enough that they left him alone. He'd gotten away with nothing more than bruises. Several large, deep, and extremely painful bruises, but simply bruises nonetheless. Stephen was a little less lucky. His gash had to be restitched and he ended up needing a blood transfusion. All the doctors had said it was a good thing they'd gotten him to the hospital in time \u2013 apparently the blow he received from the SIP agent had caused some internal bleeding and he definitely had an infection from the original wound. Sherlock and John sat around in Stephen's hospital room, trying to figure out what to do next. A figure in the hall came careening through the door and screeching to a halt. \"Sherlock!\" Greg said breathlessly. \"I was just at your flat. What happened? The lady at the front desk said your brother was\u2014\" He then caught sight of Stephen and paled significantly.",
    "Agent (2024-08-19 15:22:24.917399): Got it! Please continue with the next options when you're ready.",
    "Test (2024-08-19 15:22:25.028033): Option 2:\n\n\t5. Prologue (1)  It was nice to have the flat all to himself. Sherlock was out on a case and wouldn't be back until late, leaving John alone at 221B. He'd asked his friend if he should meet him at the crime scene after work but Sherlock declined. John didn't feel too bad being left out \u2013 it was nice to get a break. However, his break didn't last very long. Upon hearing an unusual noise in the sitting room John turned around and found something\u2026strange. A swirling circle of golden light was forming right next to the fireplace. Out from it tumbled a figure that looked all too familiar. John quickly got to his feet and the portal vanished, leaving the man on the floor and barely moving. John kneeled down next to the body and grabbed his shoulder, giving a slight gasp when he saw his face. \"Sherlock? Sherlock, can you hear me?\" But something wasn't right.",
    "Agent (2024-08-19 15:22:29.676617): I'm following along! Please share the next option when you're ready.",
    "Test (2024-08-19 15:22:29.790823): Option 3:\n\n\t5. Prologue (1)  No matter how high and mighty he acted and how great his fa\u00e7ade tended to be Sherlock could never cover up the fact that he was not a fan of overseas flights. He hadn't been across the pond in a long time, so when Phil Coulson showed up out of the blue and asked them to get on the next plane, both he and John were a bit taken off guard. Nevertheless, the detective and the doctor complied and found themselves on the next flight to New York City. Coulson wouldn't tell them why they were going, just that they were headed to SHIELD. When the three of them landed a vehicle was waiting for them. Inside the car was another agent. \"Mr. Holmes. Doctor Watson.\" She stuck out her hand. \"Agent Maria Hill.\" Both Londoners shook her hand in turn. \"I'm glad you could make it.\" Well we hardly had any choice in the matter,\" said Sherlock.",
    "Agent (2024-08-19 15:22:34.486277): Great! I'm ready for the next option whenever you are.",
    "Test (2024-08-19 15:22:34.593081): Option 4:\n\n\t5. Prologue (1)  _ \"Late last night three boats sunk on the Thames,\"\u00a0 _ the reporter on the television explained, _\"and although there is no connection to be found between them, the police are beginning an investigation\u2026\"_ The television drawled on quietly until John entered from the kitchen and turned up the volume. Walking back into the kitchen to finish making his tea, John continued listening to the report. _ \"Several eyewitnesses claim the boats were taken down by some sort of creature,\" _ \u00a0the reporter continued. John raised an eyebrow and turned to look at his flatmate who was staring intently into his microscope. \"Well, that sounds like a hoax.\" He waited for a response from Sherlock but when he didn't get one he continued. \"Sound like something you'd be interested in? Solving the case of the Loch Thames Monster?\" John chuckled to himself. \"Trivial,\" Sherlock snapped quickly. The reporter from the telly kept talking.",
    "Agent (2024-08-19 15:22:41.575055): I'm ready for the final option whenever you are!",
    "Test (2024-08-19 15:22:41.690375): Option 5:\n\n\t5. Prologue (1)  It had been about a year since Sherlock Holmes and John Watson were first introduced to the world of SHIELD, superhumans, and secret organizations. John had to admit, life had definitely gotten a lot more interesting since then \u2013 and more complicated. Since Agent Phil Coulson showed up in 221B, John had talked down inhumans from blowing their powers out of proportion, become friends (Friends? Acquaintances? That was still up in the air) with a teen addict who could shapeshift into monsters, he'd time traveled, been a telepath for a day, and met two Avengers. And that was by no means all of it. One thing that had not yet happened to Doctor Watson, however, was being asked to do something in the name of SHIELD. Did he expect to? One day, of course, he was an agent after all. The day just came up on him a little quicker than he would have guessed.",
    "Agent (2024-08-19 15:22:48.401361): I'm ready for the last option whenever you are!",
    "Test (2024-08-19 15:22:48.518806): Option 6:\n\n\t5. Prologue (1)  Sherlock and John were led into Scotland Yard by Lestrade. \"It's the second robbery this week,\" the DI explained, \"and the signature is exactly the same.\" He handed Sherlock a photograph of a symbol carved into a desk. \"That was there at the first and second robbery but each bank was held up by different people.\" \"So an organisation,\" Sherlock drawled. \"Really, Lestrade, you're getting dafter every case.\" Lestrade chose to ignore the insult. \"Here's the thing, though,\" he said. \"Both men have no memory of the incident.\" \"What, of robbing the bank?\" John questioned. \"They're lying,\" snapped Sherlock, \"there's video evidence.\" Lestrade sighed and opened the door to the interrogation area. \"Sherlock, we hooked each one up to a polygraph.\" The detective stopped short. \"That's why I brought you in.\" Sherlock and John exchanged a glance. Sherlock closed his eyes for a moment. \"You trust me to confirm the findings a piece of equipment?\" he muttered.",
