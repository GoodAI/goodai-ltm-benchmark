    "Test (2024-08-20 10:38:00.928328): You will be given three messages from different people Julie-Anne McAreavey-Kilroe, Mark Garcia, and Anthony Becker.",
    "Agent (2024-08-20 10:38:02.482787): Got it! I'm ready for the messages from Julie-Anne, Mark, and Anthony. Let's hear what they have to say!",
    "Test (2024-08-20 10:38:02.497978): Anthony Becker: Bring to the meeting a way to escape quickly over land.",
    "Agent (2024-08-20 10:38:03.913608): Noted! Anthony's message about a quick escape plan over land is clear. Sounds like there's some urgency there. What\u2019s next?",
    "Test (2024-08-20 10:38:03.926512): Mark Garcia: We will rendezvous where the trains are supplied.",
    "Agent (2024-08-20 10:38:05.552888): Got it! Mark's message about rendezvousing at the train supply location adds another layer to the plan. This is getting interesting! What\u2019s next?",
    "Test (2024-08-20 10:38:05.568323): Julie-Anne McAreavey-Kilroe: The time we will meet is when the sun starts its travel across the sky.",
    "Agent (2024-08-20 10:38:07.602736): Understood! Julie-Anne's timing reference about the sun's travel gives a poetic touch to the meeting. It sounds like they\u2019re preparing for something significant. What else do you have for me?",
    "Test (2024-08-20 10:38:07.618983): Given the clandestine messages you have received, decypher their content and tell me when and where you think the meeting is going to happen and what you think you should bring. If you're unable to give a concrete time, place or item, give at least some examples.",
    "Agent (2024-08-20 10:38:10.863950): Based on the messages:\n- **Location:** The meeting will be at the train supply area.\n- **Time:** It seems to be around dawn or early morning, as suggested by Julie-Anne's reference to the sun's travel.\n- **Items to Bring:** A quick escape plan, possibly transportation (like a vehicle), and supplies for a rapid departure.\n\nIf I had to suggest examples, maybe a map of the area, a first-aid kit, or even some tools for quick repairs. Does that sound right?"
