    "Agent (2024-08-20 03:45:31.324135): Haha, that's a clever play on words! Atheism does have a way of making you think differently about beliefs and organizations. What's your take on the topic?",
    "Test (2024-08-20 04:48:31.331102): Just burned 2,000 calories. That\u2019s the last time I leave brownies in the oven while I nap.",
    "Agent (2024-08-20 04:48:32.843651): Oh no! That's a classic kitchen disaster. At least you got a workout in while dealing with the aftermath. Any plans for your next baking adventure?",
    "Test (2024-08-20 07:06:32.846740): It takes a lot of balls to golf the way I do.",

    "Agent (2024-08-20 08:44:35.913554): That's a classic! Camo pants can be surprisingly elusive. Maybe they were hiding in plain sight? Do you often go for that style?",
    "Test (2024-08-20 10:30:35.918992): Which joke did I tell you about 6 hours 45 minutes  ago?",
    "Agent (2024-08-20 10:30:40.392032): About 6 hours and 45 minutes ago, you told me: \"Atheism is a non-prophet organization.\" Still a classic! Got any more jokes up your sleeve?"
