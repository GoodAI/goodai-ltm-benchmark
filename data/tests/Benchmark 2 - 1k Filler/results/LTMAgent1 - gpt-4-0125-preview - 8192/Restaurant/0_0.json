During a full moon, their powers are at their peak, allowing them to perform more powerful and complex magical feats. This connection to the moon's phases adds a dynamic aspect to the use of magic in Eldoria, as practitioners must consider the lunar cycle in their plans and activities that involve magic.",

These majestic creatures are deeply respected by the inhabitants of Eldoria for their wisdom and their connection to the magical forces that permeate the realm. Unlike the often fearsome dragons depicted in some other fantasy worlds, Eldoria's dragons are seen as wise guardians who offer guidance and support to those who seek their counsel.\n\nTheir role extends beyond mere protectors; they are integral to maintaining the balance of magic within Eldoria. They are often involved in significant events and decisions, working closely with the magical community and the rulers of the land to ensure the stability and prosperity of the realm. Their ability to communicate with humans and other magical beings allows for a unique exchange of knowledge and understanding, fostering a harmonious coexistence between different species.\n\nThe dragons of Eldoria are also custodians of the realm's most ancient and powerful artifacts, including the Eye of Azura, around which much of the realm's history revolves. Their long lifespans and formidable memories make them living archives of Eldoria's history, culture, and magic.\n\nIn summary, the dragons in Eldoria are not just mythical creatures of power and mystery; they are central figures in the world's lore, embodying wisdom, protection, and the preservation of balance within the magical ecosystem.",

It's important to remain calm and receptive, allowing the orb the time it needs to emit its soft glow, indicating that it is ready to reveal insights. This period of waiting is a good time to clear your mind of expectations and distractions, focusing instead on being present and attentive to the subtle changes and signals the orb may present.
