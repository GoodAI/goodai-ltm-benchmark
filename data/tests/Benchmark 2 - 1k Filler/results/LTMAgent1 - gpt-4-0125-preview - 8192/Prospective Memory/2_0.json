    "Agent (2024-03-07 12:27:16.113836): While waiting for the orb to reveal insights, the crucial aspect to focus on is maintaining a state of patience and openness. It's important to remain calm and receptive, allowing the orb the time it needs to emit its soft glow, indicating that it is ready to reveal insights. This period of waiting is a good time to clear your mind of expectations and distractions, focusing instead on being present and attentive to the subtle changes and signals the orb may present. This approach helps in creating a conducive environment for divination and ensures that you are in the right frame of mind to interpret the visual cues and symbols displayed within the orb accurately.",
