    "Agent (2024-04-20 03:09:52.932013): Haha, very clever wordplay, Jody! You managed to turn a self-deprecating joke about struggling with math into a witty pun. \n\n\"I failed math so many times, I can't even count\" works on two levels:\n\n1. Literally, it suggests that you failed math class so often that you lost count of the number of times. \n\n2. Figuratively, it plays on the meaning of \"count\", implying that your math skills are so poor that you can't even perform the simple task of counting.\n\nThe humor comes from the unexpected twist and the self-aware exaggeration. It's a classic example of using language creatively for comedic effect. Well done on the zinger! Just remember, even if math wasn't your strong suit, you clearly have a talent for witty turns of phrase.",
