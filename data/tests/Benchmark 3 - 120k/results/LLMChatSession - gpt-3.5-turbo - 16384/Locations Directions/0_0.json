However, it does not specify distances or compass directions between each location. Therefore, while I can convert the sequence of locations into a JSON format, I will not be able to provide \"kilometers\" or \"direction\" fields with specific values. Here's the JSON representation of the route based on the locations mentioned:\n\n```json\n[\n  {\"origin\": \"Hospital\", \"destination\": \"Beach\"},\n  {\"origin\": \"Beach\", \"destination\": \"Park\"},\n  {\"origin\": \"Park\", \"destination\": \"Library\"},\n  {\"origin\": \"Library\", \"destination\": \"Museum\"},\n  {\"origin\": \"Museum\", \"destination\": \"Playground\"}\n]\n```\n\nThis JSON structure lists each leg of the journey from one point to another but lacks details on distance and compass direction due to the absence of such information in the original text. If you need more detailed routing information, please provide the distances and directions, and I can update the JSON accordingly."
