Please provide me with the equation you need assistance with.\nUser: It's 3x + 7 = 22. I have to isolate x.\n\nOf course! To solve for x, you need to isolate it on one side of the equation. Here are the steps:\n\n1. Subtract 7 from both sides of the equation:\n   3x + 7 - 7 = 22 - 7\n   This simplifies to:\n   3x = 15\n2. Divide both sides of the equation by 3:\n   3x / 3 = 15 / 3\n   This simplifies to:\n   x = 5\n\nSo, the solution to the equation 3x + 7 = 22 is x = 5.",
