    "Test (2024-08-13 10:42:32.517222): 1st page:\n\n\t1. Chapter 1    Sam is sick to death of angels. Sick of angels, demons, the apocalypse, the whole nine yards. So now he's in a shopping mall with Dean, trying to sort through a giant mess of a case, but at least it's a regular case, a break from all the end-of-the-world crap that's hanging over them like the sword of Damocles. He's beginning to understand Dean's obsession with finding \u201cnormal\u201d cases, the paranormal equivalent of two-point-five kids, a dog, and a white picket fence in the suburbs. So this case, in which people started dying in weird and creative ways, seemed like the way to go for a while. Of course, it's a gigantic mess now: nothing about it makes any sense, because none of the deaths seem related except for the fact that they're all in the same mall, none of it hangs together, and whatever is responsible has a sick sense of humour. There's no wishing well in town, so it's not that. It's enough to make Sam wonder if they haven't stumbled across faeries, except that he's only ever heard of faeries in really old textbooks, and the odds are pretty slim. Faeries stick to the woods, not to shopping malls. In fact, if Sam didn't know better, he'd think it was some sort of ironic commentary on American consumer culture. Still, it 's a way to take their minds off all the death, all the suffering, the weight that's pressing down on them. Also, it takes them away from all the freaking angels, and Sam hasn't been this pleased to be doing something in months, possibly years at this point. Right now, the word \u201cangel\u201d is his least favourite in the dictionary. Sure, there was a time when he prayed every day, at first, the way normal people do. Pastor Jim explained about prayer when Sam was very small, and it seemed like a great idea at the time: to appeal to a higher power for help, for guidance, and sometimes for a puppy (when he was five years old). Then as he grew older he prayed for a whole lot of things: for Dean, for his father, to get him out of hunting (please, God). The last few years, the prayers were more desperate: please, God, don't let Dean die. Please, God, give me back my brother. Please God. Please please please. Then Sam met his first angel, and the angel looked at him as though he was something to be scraped off its shoe, didn't even want to touch him. Sam never felt so filthy in his life, tainted and sick and disgusting. He hasn't prayed in over a year now, stopped the praying the day the angels told Dean to go into a locked room and torture a demon. He's given up thinking that maybe angels are the way he first imagined them. Dean is right, they are douchebags. Meddling, sadistic pricks who don't actually care about God's creations at all. Between Uriel, Zachariah and Lucifer, Sam has had enough angels to last him a lifetime. Castiel is going a long way to earning back Dean's trust (if he ever even lost it), but he still won't come near Sam unless he absolutely has to, and so Sam avoids him as much as he can. And speaking of sadistic douchebags, Sam has reserved a special place in his heart for Gabriel, whom he's known for so long only as \u201cThe Trickster.\u201d He's pretty sure he hates him even more than Lucifer. Lucifer, at least, has tried to make nice to Sam in his own weird, twisted way. Sure, it's all a trick to seduce him into becoming a cheap suit, but at least it's a real attempt to seduce. Gabriel, on the other hand, has been going out of his way from the start to make Sam's life even more of a living hell than it already was. It seems like his reasoning follows the same patterns: Dean is going to die? Awesome. You know what would be fun? Making Sam live his death over and over. Even more fun? Making Sam live without him for six extra months, just to see what will happen. For shits and giggles. You know what else is fun? Making him argue with Dean. Shoving them both into a make-believe TV land and tormenting them until they both decide to say \u201cyes\u201d to playing angel condom, because boo-hoo, little Gabriel wants his angelic brethren to get their little apocalypse over with. Gabriel, Sam has decided, is the worst coward of the lot: hiding behind his tricks and his pranks and his sadistic douchebaggery. Fucker. \u201cOh, come now, I'm not _that_ bad!\u201d  Sam straightens up from where he's been looking at the statue of an overweight man, complete with dirty jeans and black t-shirt from Think Geek, XBox controller held in a death grip. It's a wax effigy, except that not five hours ago he was alive and well and arguing vociferously with someone else in the store about how lame the new reboot of Star Trek was. \u201cI knew it,\u201d Sam is resigned. Can't bring himself to be surprised. \u201cYou're way too fond of irony for your own good.\u201d  \u201cWhat can I say? It's an appealing trope,\u201d Gabriel smirks, hops up to sit on a glass display case full of Wii's and iPods, his short legs dangling ludicrously. He's wearing a really garish shirt, all big prints and loud colours, a leather bomber jacket over it, his hair slicked back with what might be water but looks more like Brillcreem. \u201cThe Fonz called. He wants his wardrobe back.\u201d  Gabriel pretends to be wounded. \u201cOh, Sam, always with the _bon mot_.\u201d  \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d  \u201cWhat, I can't just have some fun now and then? I'm taking care of some colossal assholes who think that their possessions are more important than their lives.\u201d Gabriel crosses his legs, folds his arms across his chest, smirks at him. He looks around. \u201cI've always hated malls. Let's take this little pow-wow outside, shall we?\u201d  He snaps his fingers, and suddenly they're outside, Gabriel perched on the hood of the Impala instead of the counter. Sam straightens, rubs the back of his neck, tries to remember where he left Dean. \u201cDean will kill you for doing that to his car.\u201d  \u201cHe's welcome to try. I don't foresee him pulling holy oil out of your ass any time soon.\u201d Sam snorts. \u201cYou know what? I don't care. I know there's nothing we can do to stop you. Was there some new and interesting form of torture you wanted to inflict on me this week? How about skipping the preliminaries this time and just making me insane right off the bat?\u201d  \u201cSuch a drama queen. I'm amazed Dean has put up with you for so long. That's the trouble, isn't it? That he puts up with you, I mean. Big brother, always looking out for little Sammy, no matter what kind of shit you pull. He's the soul of forgiveness, isn't he?\u201d  Sam's fists clench at his side. \u201cJust... shut up, would you? You don't know what you're talking about.\u201d  \u201cOh, I think I do. It's pathetic, really, how you have no life outside of him. Sure, you made a big show of going off on your own, going to Stanford, getting a girl, but you hopped right back into the life with alacrity, didn't you, Sammy-boy? Followed wherever big brother led you. And look what happened when he died, the way we all knew he would: you imploded.\u201d Sam feels heat creeping up his neck, suffusing his cheeks. \u201cSelf-destructed so fast I almost got whiplash. Addiction is so _clich\u00e9_ , too, although I will credit you with putting a creative spin on it by unleashing the apocalypse in the process. And then Dean forgave that too.\u201d  Which just goes to show what Gabriel knows. Dean hasn't forgiven him, not by a long shot. Hell, there's no forgiveness for any of what he's done. \u201cJust... whatever it is you're going to do, can we get it over with?\u201d he asks finally, feeling his shoulders slump. He's tired of arguing with angels. Tired of arguing with Dean, for that matter. Just tired. Gabriel sulks. \u201cYou're no fun at all. I'm trying to impart a lesson here, chucklehead, and for once I was trying to do it without resorting to reshaping reality around you.\u201d When Sam doesn't answer, he sighs. \u201cYou may not believe this, but I like you, Sam.\u201d Sam snorts derisively at that, and Gabriel holds up a hand. \u201cNo, really. You kind of remind me of me, only without the brilliant sense of humour and the impeccable fashion sense. And I'm really sick of watching you trail after your brother like a kicked dog. You're holding each other back, you know. You need to both let go, and follow your destinies.\u201d  \u201cHaven't we already had this discussion?\u201d Sam is getting a headache. \u201cAnd look how well that turned out. I was hoping you'd listen to me this time, instead of digging in your heels. You think your brother appreciates having to drag you around on a leash all the time? Or has he taught you to walk to heel yet?\u201d there's scorn in the angel's voice now, and Sam feels his temper snap. \u201cShut up.\u201d  A sigh. \u201cI can see this isn't going anywhere. Fine. Don't say I didn't try being reasonable first.\u201d  Gabriel reaches out and, in a gesture that reminds Sam oddly of Castiel, pokes two fingers against his forehead, just above the bridge of his nose. And everything goes dark. \t2. Chapter 2  Zombies. Straight out of a Romero triple-feature. Slow and shambling and wearing really terrible 1970s clothes. There are only two of them, though, and after two spectacular head shots (he ought to get a prize, but since when is life ever fair that way?) Dean is by himself in an abandoned clothing outlet. Surrounded by jeans, halter tops, and two decomposing corpses that just literally tried to eat his flesh. It's actually kind of awesome. Except for the flesh-eating part: that was gross. He checks to make sure there aren't any more undead lurking behind the display racks, finds a corpse that looks like it's been snacked on, and he puts a bullet through its forehead just to be on the safe side. All things considered, he thinks that whatever is going on, it's not actually about the zombie apocalypse, and that's a good thing: they've already got one apocalypse to deal with, two just feels like overkill. He conducts a sweep of the store, then just outside the door. \u201cIt feels like Half-Life 2,\u201d he says to no one in particular. Speaking of which, he hasn't heard from Sam since he headed off into the electronics store. He glides down the deserted hallway, thankful at least that when the dying started in earnest someone had the good sense to evacuate the mall. The electronics store is dark, half the lights out for some reason. It's also deserted, except for one guy who looks like he belongs in a wax museum for the chronically lame and nerdy. \u201cSam?\u201d He pokes around in the aisles, finds Sam's pack, but no sign of Sam. \u201cSammy? You in here?\u201d Nothing. He pulls out his cell, dials Sam's number, is rewarded by the sound of Sam's pack ringing shrilly, with the same ring tone he programmed into it a couple of months ago. Sam pretended to be annoyed that he programmed The Muppet Show theme as a ringtone, but Dean can't help but notice that he hasn't changed it yet. Which doesn't solve his more immediate problem of his baby brother being AWOL. He picks up the bag, starts a more systematic sweep of the mall, getting a sinking feeling in the pit of his stomach. \u201cSam!\u201d  Still nothing. The bookstore is empty (first place to check for Sam), although there's a woman who's become a permanent display case for Oprah's book club, which makes him shudder. He's never watching that show again. The food court is empty, and he helps himself to a still-warm burger (hey, a guy has needs) before moving onto the next place, but eventually he has to reconcile himself to the idea that there's no one here. There are only two floors to this building, it's not that big: a small joint in a podunk town. So the next logical step is to try outside. Sam can't be far, that much is obvious. Sam wanted back into hunting, he's been acting like Dean's freaking shadow ever since Dean got back from the future (and wow, it hurts his head even to say that), and he is definitely not sneaking off to get a fix, or whatever. Ruby's dead, there's been no sign of demon activity, and Dean is definitely, definitely not thinking any thoughts like that because they've put all that shit behind them. \u201cSammy!\u201d  The parking lot is all but deserted, but he catches sight of a familiar figure leaning up against the Impala, and his heart drops into his stomach. \u201cGet away from my baby, you prick!\u201d  Gabriel shakes his head, clucks his tongue. He doesn't move from where he is, and instead leans over to scratch behind the ears of a large dog sitting at his feet. What is it with this guy and dogs, anyway? \u201cTsk, temper temper, Dean-o. Hypertension is the silent killer, you know.\u201d  Dean feels his fists clench, his teeth grind together. This is going to cost him a fortune in dental work, if he ever survives the apocalypse. \u201cAre you here to lecture me on how to take care of my arteries?\u201d  There's a derisive snort. \u201cFar be it for me to take your cheeseburgers away. I see you haven't given up that habit either. Well, maybe you'll have a heart attack or a stroke before the apocalypse: seems like as viable a plan as any other you've ever come up with. I hear petting animals is good for your blood pressure,\u201d he pats the dog's head. \u201cNice dog,\u201d Dean says, since the situation seems to call for it. It is a nice dog, as far as he can tell. He doesn't know much about them, but this one looks big and healthy, its black coat glossy, big hazel eyes staring at him. He didn't know dog's eyes came in that colour. It has a long feathered tail, which thumps on the ground in greeting, its tongue lolling from its mouth. \u201cWhat happened to the small yappy one?\u201d  \u201cI still have him, but I left him at home. He doesn't like you.\u201d  \u201cHow many dogs do you have, anyway?\u201d Dean feels like the conversation has taken a turn for the surreal, but can't quite help himself. \u201cEnough. You like shepherds?\u201d  Dean blinks. \u201cUh... yeah, I guess. I like dogs, they're fine. Don't have much use for 'em in my line of work, but yeah. Dogs're nice. Have you been smoking up?\u201d he asks, tilting his head a bit. \u201cDon't need to. Life is a natural high.\u201d  Dean feels a tension headache coming on. \u201cDo you know where Sam is?\u201d  \u201cI might.\u201d  \u201cDid you do something to him?\u201d  Gabriel manages to look injured. \u201cWhy do you always assume that I've done something?\u201d  \u201cBecause you always do?\u201d  \u201cFair enough. Look, it's not my problem you lost your brother. Maybe you shouldn't be trying to keep him on such a close leash anyway",

    "Test (2024-08-13 10:42:33.950556): 2nd page:\n\n\u201cMetaphor, yes, I get it. Look, are you here to do something ironic and whatever, or just to play peanut gallery?\u201d  Gabriel shrugs, and his eyes sparkle with poorly-concealed amusement. \u201cI like the peanut gallery. The snacks are excellent, and provide me with endless ballistic opportunities. But since you're not in a listening mood, I guess I'll just leave you to your search.\u201d He snaps his fingers, disappears. Dean gets the feeling that the finger-snapping is pretty much just for show. \u201cHey, you forgot your\u2014\u201d but Gabriel is long gone, \u201cdog,\u201d he finishes lamely. \u201cTerrific.\u201d He stares at the dog, which is sitting with its head cocked to one side, staring at him. \u201cHey, boy,\u201d Dean returns the stare, then ducks his head, checking. \u201cYep, definitely a boy. Your master is a douche, just so you know. I know you've got the whole unflinching loyalty thing going for you, but you'd be better off putting your trust elsewhere.\u201d He's talking to a dog. Awesome. He's obviously further gone than he thought. \u201cYou haven't seen my brother, have you? He's, like, eight feet tall, in serious need of a haircut, and looks like I'm about to kick him most of the time these days. Answers to Sam.\u201d  The dog wags its tail. Thump-thump-thump against the asphalt. \u201cNo? Didn't think so.\u201d Dean heaves a long-suffering sigh. It's not really like Sam to up and disappear in the middle of a case \u2014not recently, anyway\u2014 and he left all his gear behind, and Dean is trying very hard not to get worried just yet. There could be any number of explanations for this, none of which are particularly reassuring if he thinks about it for too long. \u201cAll right. I gotta go look for him.\u201d  He dumps Sam's stuff in the trunk, keeps hold of the cell phone just in case, pulls the map of the area out of the glove compartment and spreads it out on the hood of the Impala. The dog settles at his feet with a whuffing noise, lays its muzzle on its forepaws. It's not a big town, so he figures he can go looking in concentric circles, stay on foot for the time being, to make sure he doesn't drive right by Sam if he's, say, passed out somewhere outside. \u201cHe can't be far, right?\u201d he says to the dog. \u201cI mean, supposing he hasn't been zapped somewhere by angels, but so far that's only been my problem. Angels don't like zapping Sam anywhere if they can help it. All right,\u201d he folds up the map, tucks it in the inside pocket of his jacket. \u201cSee you around, boy.\u201d  He heads purposefully toward the entrance of the mall, figures he'll use that as a starting point, work his way around. To his surprise, the dog instantly gets to its feet and trots behind him, feathered tail held high behind it. He turns, makes a shooing motion. \u201cYou can't come with me. Go find Gabriel. Go on, git!\u201d  The dog stops, tail drooping, and whines at him. \u201cNo, I mean it. I have to look for Sam.\u201d  The dog whines again, gives a hopeful wag of its tail, and he sighs. \u201cAre you at least a good tracker?\u201d  The dog cocks its head at him, both ears perked. \u201cI didn't think so. Well, come on, then.\u201d There's a joyous bark, and the dog bounds to his side, tail wagging enthusiastically. \u201cWhy couldn't Gabriel have abandoned a bloodhound?\u201d he grumbles. \u201cI don't have any sheep for you to herd, you know.\u201d  The search goes badly. He spends three hours making his way around the mall, through the streets, checking with every passer-by and shop owner he can find, but no one has seen hide nor hair of Sam. It's like he's fallen off the face of the planet, and by now Dean is hard-pressed not to lose his shit. He calls Bobby, for lack of any better idea, but Bobby doesn't have anything helpful to add either. So he keeps looking until the sun sets and it gets too dark to look properly. He heads back to the car, lets himself sink onto the bumper, head in his hands. \u201cShit shit shit, fuck!\u201d  The dog is still there, has been literally dogging his heels all afternoon and evening. It whines, picking up on his mood, shoves its nose into his ribcage. \u201cI've lost him. What the hell kind of lousy brother am I, that I can't even keep track of Sam when he's a hundred yards away?\u201d he asks the dog. \u201cSome hunter I'm turning out to be. Can't do anything right.\u201d  Predictably enough, the dog doesn't have an answer, and there's nothing left but to head back to the motel. There's a good chance Sam will head back to the room now that they've been separated for so many hours. He pushes himself to his feet, pulls open the door, and nearly gets knocked off his feet as the dog barrels past him and settles into the shotgun seat. \u201cOh, no you don't!\u201d he leans into the car, makes a grab for the dog. \u201cThat's the original leather, you flea-ridden mutt! Get off there!\u201d He tugs fruitlessly at the dog, realizes that it's a lot bigger and a lot heavier than he thought at first. It gives him a shit-eating doggy grin, the furry bastard, and flops onto the seat, tongue hanging out. \u201cWe are not going for a car ride,\u201d he informs it sternly. \u201cI don't care how cute you are.\u201d He goes around the car, yanks open the passenger-side door, and tries to haul out the dog, only to meet with a hundred-odd pounds of very determined canine resistance. \u201cCome on! Son of a bitch,\u201d he stops, stares at the dog. \u201cI don't have time for this. Fine, come with me, then, but you can't stay. And don't drool on the upholstery, or so help me I will kick your furry ass out of the car while it's still running.\u201d  He drives back to the motel, the dog panting happily in the seat next to him, grumbles to himself under his breath about becoming a pushover in his old age. If Sam is there, he'll never let him live down being bullied by a creature that habitually drinks out of the toilet. God, he hopes Sam is there. His life is stressful enough as it is. He unlocks the motel room, turns to order the dog to stay, or whatever, but it's already too late: the dog has wormed its way through his legs and is in the room. He shakes his head, knows when he's defeated. If nothing else, it shows that it's Gabriel's dog: stubborn, and bent on driving him nuts. \u201cSam! Sammy, you here?\u201d There's no answer, but the dog is back at his feet, its tail wagging so hard it's practically a blur of motion. He switches on the light, scans the room for signs that Sam may have come and gone, but there are none. \u201cSam!\u201d The dog cavorts around him, play-snapping at the air, and he reaches down and pats it absentmindedly, dumps his gear on the floor. He checks his phone messages, but apart from a single text message from Bobby (and the thought of Bobby sending text messages still amuses him to no end) saying that he's checking in with some contacts to see if there's been any indication of weirdness or disappearances in the area, there's nothing. There's nothing on the motel phone either, which he checks out of principle rather than because he really thinks Sam would have left a message there. He sinks down on his bed \u2014the one closest the door, as usual\u2014 clasps his hands between his knees, feeling his heart clench in his chest. For the first time, he wonders what he'll do if he can't find Sam, and the thought sends shivers of panic through him. \u201cDammit, Sam, where are you?\u201d  There's a blur of motion, and before he can so much as flinch the dog has launched itself at his chest. It bowls him backward on the bed and straddles him, soft pink tongue lapping at his face, giving him the most thorough licking he's ever received in his life. He sputters, shoves at it, tries to twist away. \u201cAck! Get off! That's... ptuh! That's seriously gross, dude. I only kiss girls on the lips. Get off!\u201d  The dog doesn't budge, but it stops licking him. He's stuck, spreadeagled on the bed with a hundred pounds of dog on his chest. It shoves its nose into his face, fixes him with an intense gaze, the weird-coloured hazel eyes seemingly waiting for him to do something, or maybe say something. For the second time that day it occurs to him that he's never seen a dog with eyes that colour, and if it's a black dog, shouldn't it have brown eyes? He blinks at it. No. It can't be. \u201cSam?\u201d  The dog barks once, and licks the tip of his nose. Oh, shit. \t3. Chapter 3  \u201cCome again?\u201d Bobby's tone is incredulous, and Dean can't blame him. This one is weird, even by Winchester standards. \u201cIt's the only thing that makes sense, Bobby,\u201d he says, watching the dog as it sniffs its way around the edges of the room, taking in everything as though for the first time. Well, it sort of is the first time, he supposes. \u201cIt \u2014he\u2014 even answers to his name. Hey, Sam!\u201d he snaps his fingers. The dog perks up its ears, comes trotting over, and he gives it a friendly scritch behind the ears as a reward, earning himself a tail-wagging. \u201cAre you sure you didn't fall on that fool head of yours, boy?\u201d  \u201cI'm sure, Bobby. One minute I'm fighting off the horde from Dawn of the Dead while Sam is dealing with Night at the Museum in reverse, or whatever, and the next thing I know he's gone and that damned trickster is back in the game. Or angel, or whatever he is.\u201d  \u201cIt don't make a lick of sense. Why would he turn your brother into a dog?\u201d  \u201cBeats me. He did go on for a while about my keeping Sam on too short a leash, so maybe he decided to make it literal? Anyway, it doesn't matter. What matters is turning him back. This is seriously too weird for me. My brother is a _sheepdog_ , Bobby.\u201d He pauses. \u201cAre you laughing?\u201d  It sounds suspiciously like Bobby is sniggering. \u201c'Course not. It ain't a laughing matter, is it?\u201d  \u201cDammit, Bobby, this isn't funny!\u201d  Okay, Bobby is definitely laughing. It sounds as though he's got his hand over the mouthpiece of his phone, but a few seconds later he gives up all pretense, and Dean can hear him guffawing on the other end, hand over the receiver to muffle the sound. \u201cBobby!\u201d  The dog \u2014Sam, he reminds himself\u2014 puts its front paws up on his knees, shoves its head into his face. On the other end of the line, Bobby pulls himself together, still giggling. \u201cOkay, I'm sorry. You gotta admit, it's pretty funny.\u201d  \u201cHilarious.\u201d  \u201cYou're sure it's Sam?\u201d  Dean shrugs, even though Bobby can't see him. \u201cAs sure as I can be. It's not like he can answer me in any way that I can understand. He's a dog.\u201d  \u201cDoes he know what's happened?\u201d  He shoves the dog back onto the floor, fondles its ears, and it leans into the touch, tail thumping. \u201cI don't think so. I mean, I think he knows he's Sam, but I think he's really a dog, too. I mean, he's all happy and tail-waggy and shit. Sam hasn't been this cheerful in, well, ever.\u201d The realization depresses him. He addresses the dog. \u201cYou know you're Sam, right?\u201d  The dog barks once. \u201cI think that's about as much of an answer as I'm ever going to get directly from the horse's mouth. Or the dog's mouth, or whatever.\u201d  Bobby snorts and sounds like he's perilously close to another fit of hysterical laughter. \u201cOkay. Why don't you haul your asses down here, and we'll figure it out. Although I don't need to tell you, boy, that if this is an angel's doing, even if it's just Gabriel, it's going to be damn near impossible to fix unless he wants you to do it.\u201d  \u201cI know,\u201d he rubs his hand over his face. It smells doggy. \u201cI just... God. How does this kind of stuff even happen to us? What am I supposed to do with him in the meantime?\u201d  \u201cHe's your brother. Figure something out. At least dogs like to ride in cars.\u201d  Dean lets himself flop backward on the bed with a groan, tosses the cell phone next to his watch and his wallet on the night stand. The dog \u2014Sam, he tells himself again, still can't quite wrap his mind around it\u2014 prowls along the walls, determined to explore every inch of baseboard, it seems. It shoves its nose in the salt line over the threshold, sneezes, shakes its head, looks up with that endearing doggy grin, and he finds himself grinning back at it. \u201cAt least you're a happy dog. Are you sure you're my emo little brother? There's no way he'd ever let himself be that content. He's all broody and angsty, usually. I figure if he were to turn into a dog he's be one of those dogs with droopy ears and sad eyes. Maybe you're not Sam, maybe you're just some dog named Sam that that freaking trickster left behind just to mess with my head.\u201d  The dog cocks its head to the side, sits on its haunches and watches him. \u201cDo you understand me when I talk? Bark once for 'yes,' twice for 'no. '\u201d  It's possible that that's the stupidest thing he's ever said, he realizes as soon as the words have left his mouth. The dog barks twice, and he has to restrain himself from hitting his head against the wall as hard as he can. \u201cYou're doing it on purpose to screw with me now, aren't you?\u201d  The dog barks once. \u201cFuck you, Sparky.\u201d  The dog barks twice, and then someone hammers furiously on the wall from the room next door. \u201cShut the fuck up in there!\u201d  He pounds the wall back. \u201cShut up yourself!\u201d He turns to \u2014Sam. His brain stutters over the name, can't match it to the body. \u201cOkay, no more barking unless we want to get kicked out. I don't know if we're even allowed animals in here.\u201d He stares at the dog, throws up his hands. \u201cYou know what? I'm not dealing with this tonight. Maybe we'll luck out and it's a twenty-four hour thing, and you'll be back to normal tomorrow. What kind of dog are you, anyway? I know Gabriel said shepherd, but that doesn't exactly narrow it down. You don't look like a German shepherd, and you're definitely not Lassie",

It figures you'd be some sort of froofy European breed.\u201d The dog just gives him a reproachful look. \u201cNice-looking dog, though. Says here you're supposed to be good with kids but that you need lots of exercise. Not that I'm anticipating taking you for long walks, or whatever, so you can forget it.\u201d  The dog's ears perk up at that, and he sighs. No saying the \u201cw\u201d word in front of the dog, copy that. He shuts the laptop, shucks his clothes and tosses them on a chair. There's nothing to do now except sleep it off and hope it's all some sort of really weird dream that he'll never, ever mention to Sam, except to tease him for being turned into a fluffy European dog. He crawls under the bedclothes, pulls them up to his chin, reaches over to switch off the light, when the whole bed lurches to the side, swaying alarmingly. \u201cOh, no! I am not sharing the bed with a dog. You can either take the other bed, or sleep on the floor like a normal dog.\u201d  A moment later he's got a face full of dog, its tongue working over him enthusiastically. \u201cGah! Get off!\u201d he shoves at it ineffectually, and is definitely beginning to sense a pattern here. \u201cFine, fine! You can sleep on the bed. Just not on top of me, got it? Jeez, give a guy some space here, mutt.\u201d  The dog chuffs happily, flops down by his legs with an ominous creak of bedsprings. He switches off the light and lies there, staring at the ceiling, listening to the rhythmic thump-thump-thump of its tail against the bedspread. A few moments later it heaves a sigh of contentment, the tail stops wagging, and the only sound to be heard in the room is its soft breathing. He lets his eyes slip closed, unable to worry overmuch with the comforting weight of the dog leaning against his leg, drifts to sleep.",

So now he's in a shopping mall with Dean, trying to sort through a giant mess of a case, but at least it's a regular case, a break from all the end-of-the-world crap that's hanging over them like the sword of Damocles. He's beginning to understand Dean's obsession with finding \u201cnormal\u201d cases, the paranormal equivalent of two-point-five kids, a dog, and a white picket fence in the suburbs. So this case, in which people started dying in weird and creative ways, seemed like the way to go for a while. Of course, it's a gigantic mess now: nothing about it makes any sense, because none of the deaths seem related except for the fact that they're all in the same mall, none of it hangs together, and whatever is responsible has a sick sense of humour. There's no wishing well in town, so it's not that. It's enough to make Sam wonder if they haven't stumbled across faeries, except that he's only ever heard of faeries in really old textbooks, and the odds are pretty slim. Faeries stick to the woods, not to shopping malls. In fact, if Sam didn't know better, he'd think it was some sort of ironic commentary on American consumer culture. Still, it 's a way to take their minds off all the death, all the suffering, the weight that's pressing down on them. Also, it takes them away from all the freaking angels, and Sam hasn't been this pleased to be doing something in months, possibly years at this point. Right now, the word \u201cangel\u201d is his least favourite in the dictionary. Sure, there was a time when he prayed every day, at first, the way normal people do. Pastor Jim explained about prayer when Sam was very small, and it seemed like a great idea at the time: to appeal to a higher power for help, for guidance, and sometimes for a puppy (when he was five years old). Then as he grew older he prayed for a whole lot of things: for Dean, for his father, to get him out of hunting (please, God). The last few years, the prayers were more desperate: please, God, don't let Dean die. Please, God, give me back my brother. Please God. Please please please. Then Sam met his first angel, and the angel looked at him as though he was something to be scraped off its shoe, didn't even want to touch him. Sam never felt so filthy in his life, tainted and sick and disgusting. He hasn't prayed in over a year now, stopped the praying the day the angels told Dean to go into a locked room and torture a demon. He's given up thinking that maybe angels are the way he first imagined them. Dean is right, they are douchebags. Meddling, sadistic pricks who don't actually care about God's creations at all. Between Uriel, Zachariah and Lucifer, Sam has had enough angels to last him a lifetime. Castiel is going a long way to earning back Dean's trust (if he ever even lost it), but he still won't come near Sam unless he absolutely has to, and so Sam avoids him as much as he can. And speaking of sadistic douchebags, Sam has reserved a special place in his heart for Gabriel, whom he's known for so long only as \u201cThe Trickster.\u201d He's pretty sure he hates him even more than Lucifer. Lucifer, at least, has tried to make nice to Sam in his own weird, twisted way. Sure, it's all a trick to seduce him into becoming a cheap suit, but at least it's a real attempt to seduce. Gabriel, on the other hand, has been going out of his way from the start to make Sam's life even more of a living hell than it already was. It seems like his reasoning follows the same patterns: Dean is going to die? Awesome. You know what would be fun? Making Sam live his death over and over. Even more fun? Making Sam live without him for six extra months, just to see what will happen. For shits and giggles. You know what else is fun? Making him argue with Dean. Shoving them both into a make-believe TV land and tormenting them until they both decide to say \u201cyes\u201d to playing angel condom, because boo-hoo, little Gabriel wants his angelic brethren to get their little apocalypse over with. Gabriel, Sam has decided, is the worst coward of the lot: hiding behind his tricks and his pranks and his sadistic douchebaggery. Fucker. \u201cOh, come now, I'm not _that_ bad!\u201d  Sam straightens up from where he's been looking at the statue of an overweight man, complete with dirty jeans and black t-shirt from Think Geek, XBox controller held in a death grip. It's a wax effigy, except that not five hours ago he was alive and well and arguing vociferously with someone else in the store about how lame the new reboot of Star Trek was. \u201cI knew it,\u201d Sam is resigned. Can't bring himself to be surprised. \u201cYou're way too fond of irony for your own good.\u201d  \u201cWhat can I say? It's an appealing trope,\u201d Gabriel smirks, hops up to sit on a glass display case full of Wii's and iPods, his short legs dangling ludicrously. He's wearing a really garish shirt, all big prints and loud colours, a leather bomber jacket over it, his hair slicked back with what might be water but looks more like Brillcreem. \u201cThe Fonz called. He wants his wardrobe back.\u201d  Gabriel pretends to be wounded. \u201cOh, Sam, always with the _bon mot_.\u201d  \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d  \u201cWhat, I can't just have some fun now and then? I'm taking care of some colossal assholes who think that their possessions are more important than their lives.\u201d Gabriel crosses his legs, folds his arms across his chest, smirks at him. He looks around. \u201cI've always hated malls. Let's take this little pow-wow outside, shall we?\u201d  He snaps his fingers, and suddenly they're outside, Gabriel perched on the hood of the Impala instead of the counter. Sam straightens, rubs the back of his neck, tries to remember where he left Dean. \u201cDean will kill you for doing that to his car.\u201d  \u201cHe's welcome to try. I don't foresee him pulling holy oil out of your ass any time soon.\u201d Sam snorts. \u201cYou know what? I don't care. I know there's nothing we can do to stop you. Was there some new and interesting form of torture you wanted to inflict on me this week? How about skipping the preliminaries this time and just making me insane right off the bat?\u201d  \u201cSuch a drama queen. I'm amazed Dean has put up with you for so long. That's the trouble, isn't it? That he puts up with you, I mean. Big brother, always looking out for little Sammy, no matter what kind of shit you pull. He's the soul of forgiveness, isn't he?\u201d  Sam's fists clench at his side. \u201cJust... shut up, would you? You don't know what you're talking about.\u201d  \u201cOh, I think I do. It's pathetic, really, how you have no life outside of him. Sure, you made a big show of going off on your own, going to Stanford, getting a girl, but you hopped right back into the life with alacrity, didn't you, Sammy-boy? Followed wherever big brother led you. And look what happened when he died, the way we all knew he would: you imploded.\u201d Sam feels heat creeping up his neck, suffusing his cheeks. \u201cSelf-destructed so fast I almost got whiplash. Addiction is so _clich\u00e9_ , too, although I will credit you with putting a creative spin on it by unleashing the apocalypse in the process. And then Dean forgave that too.\u201d  Which just goes to show what Gabriel knows. Dean hasn't forgiven him, not by a long shot. Hell, there's no forgiveness for any of what he's done. \u201cJust... whatever it is you're going to do, can we get it over with?\u201d he asks finally, feeling his shoulders slump. He's tired of arguing with angels. Tired of arguing with Dean, for that matter. Just tired. Gabriel sulks. \u201cYou're no fun at all. I'm trying to impart a lesson here, chucklehead, and for once I was trying to do it without resorting to reshaping reality around you.\u201d When Sam doesn't answer, he sighs. \u201cYou may not believe this, but I like you, Sam.\u201d Sam snorts derisively at that, and Gabriel holds up a hand. \u201cNo, really. You kind of remind me of me, only without the brilliant sense of humour and the impeccable fashion sense. And I'm really sick of watching you trail after your brother like a kicked dog. You're holding each other back, you know. You need to both let go, and follow your destinies.\u201d  \u201cHaven't we already had this discussion?\u201d Sam is getting a headache. \u201cAnd look how well that turned out. I was hoping you'd listen to me this time, instead of digging in your heels. You think your brother appreciates having to drag you around on a leash all the time? Or has he taught you to walk to heel yet?\u201d there's scorn in the angel's voice now, and Sam feels his temper snap. \u201cShut up.\u201d  A sigh. \u201cI can see this isn't going anywhere. Fine. Don't say I didn't try being reasonable first.\u201d  Gabriel reaches out and, in a gesture that reminds Sam oddly of Castiel, pokes two fingers against his forehead, just above the bridge of his nose. And everything goes dark. \t2. Chapter 2  Zombies. Straight out of a Romero triple-feature. Slow and shambling and wearing really terrible 1970s clothes. There are only two of them, though, and after two spectacular head shots (he ought to get a prize, but since when is life ever fair that way?) Dean is by himself in an abandoned clothing outlet. Surrounded by jeans, halter tops, and two decomposing corpses that just literally tried to eat his flesh. It's actually kind of awesome. Except for the flesh-eating part: that was gross. He checks to make sure there aren't any more undead lurking behind the display racks, finds a corpse that looks like it's been snacked on, and he puts a bullet through its forehead just to be on the safe side. All things considered, he thinks that whatever is going on, it's not actually about the zombie apocalypse, and that's a good thing: they've already got one apocalypse to deal with, two just feels like overkill. He conducts a sweep of the store, then just outside the door. \u201cIt feels like Half-Life 2,\u201d he says to no one in particular. Speaking of which, he hasn't heard from Sam since he headed off into the electronics store. He glides down the deserted hallway, thankful at least that when the dying started in earnest someone had the good sense to evacuate the mall. The electronics store is dark, half the lights out for some reason. It's also deserted, except for one guy who looks like he belongs in a wax museum for the chronically lame and nerdy. \u201cSam?\u201d He pokes around in the aisles, finds Sam's pack, but no sign of Sam. \u201cSammy? You in here?\u201d Nothing. He pulls out his cell, dials Sam's number, is rewarded by the sound of Sam's pack ringing shrilly, with the same ring tone he programmed into it a couple of months ago. Sam pretended to be annoyed that he programmed The Muppet Show theme as a ringtone, but Dean can't help but notice that he hasn't changed it yet. Which doesn't solve his more immediate problem of his baby brother being AWOL. He picks up the bag, starts a more systematic sweep of the mall, getting a sinking feeling in the pit of his stomach. \u201cSam!\u201d  Still nothing. The bookstore is empty (first place to check for Sam), although there's a woman who's become a permanent display case for Oprah's book club, which makes him shudder. He's never watching that show again. The food court is empty, and he helps himself to a still-warm burger (hey, a guy has needs) before moving onto the next place, but eventually he has to reconcile himself to the idea that there's no one here. There are only two floors to this building, it's not that big: a small joint in a podunk town. So the next logical step is to try outside. Sam can't be far, that much is obvious. Sam wanted back into hunting, he's been acting like Dean's freaking shadow ever since Dean got back from the future (and wow, it hurts his head even to say that), and he is definitely not sneaking off to get a fix, or whatever. Ruby's dead, there's been no sign of demon activity, and Dean is definitely, definitely not thinking any thoughts like that because they've put all that shit behind them. \u201cSammy!\u201d  The parking lot is all but deserted, but he catches sight of a familiar figure leaning up against the Impala, and his heart drops into his stomach. \u201cGet away from my baby, you prick!\u201d  Gabriel shakes his head, clucks his tongue. He doesn't move from where he is, and instead leans over to scratch behind the ears of a large dog sitting at his feet. What is it with this guy and dogs, anyway? \u201cTsk, temper temper, Dean-o. Hypertension is the silent killer, you know.\u201d  Dean feels his fists clench, his teeth grind together. This is going to cost him a fortune in dental work, if he ever survives the apocalypse. \u201cAre you here to lecture me on how to take care of my arteries?\u201d  There's a derisive snort. \u201cFar be it for me to take your cheeseburgers away. I see you haven't given up that habit either. Well, maybe you'll have a heart attack or a stroke before the apocalypse: seems like as viable a plan as any other you've ever come up with. I hear petting animals is good for your blood pressure,\u201d he pats the dog's head. \u201cNice dog,\u201d Dean says, since the situation seems to call for it. It is a nice dog, as far as he can tell. He doesn't know much about them, but this one looks big and healthy, its black coat glossy, big hazel eyes staring at him. He didn't know dog's eyes came in that colour. It has a long feathered tail, which thumps on the ground in greeting, its tongue lolling from its mouth. \u201cWhat happened to the small yappy one?\u201d  \u201cI still have him, but I left him at home. He doesn't like you.\u201d  \u201cHow many dogs do you have, anyway?\u201d Dean feels like the conversation has taken a turn for the surreal, but can't quite help himself. \u201cEnough. You like shepherds?\u201d  Dean blinks. \u201cUh... yeah, I guess. I like dogs, they're fine. Don't have much use for 'em in my line of work, but yeah. Dogs're nice. Have you been smoking up?\u201d he asks, tilting his head a bit. \u201cDon't need to. Life is a natural high.\u201d  Dean feels a tension headache coming on. \u201cDo you know where Sam is?\u201d  \u201cI might.\u201d  \u201cDid you do something to him?\u201d  Gabriel manages to look injured. \u201cWhy do you always assume that I've done something?\u201d  \u201cBecause you always do?\u201d  \u201cFair enough. Look, it's not my problem you lost your brother. Maybe you shouldn't be trying to keep him on such a close leash anyway",

The snacks are excellent, and provide me with endless ballistic opportunities. But since you're not in a listening mood, I guess I'll just leave you to your search.\u201d He snaps his fingers, disappears.

Your master is a douche, just so you know. I know you've got the whole unflinching loyalty thing going for you, but you'd be better off putting your trust elsewhere.\u201d He's talking to a dog. Awesome. He's obviously further gone than he thought. \u201cYou haven't seen my brother, have you? He's, like, eight feet tall, in serious need of a haircut, and looks like I'm about to kick him most of the time these days. Answers to Sam.\u201d  The dog wags its tail. Thump-thump-thump against the asphalt. \u201cNo? Didn't think so.\u201d Dean heaves a long-suffering sigh. It's not really like Sam to up and disappear in the middle of a case \u2014not recently, anyway\u2014 and he left all his gear behind, and Dean is trying very hard not to get worried just yet. There could be any number of explanations for this, none of which are particularly reassuring if he thinks about it for too long. \u201cAll right. I gotta go look for him.\u201d  He dumps Sam's stuff in the trunk, keeps hold of the cell phone just in case, pulls the map of the area out of the glove compartment and spreads it out on the hood of the Impala. The dog settles at his feet with a whuffing noise, lays its muzzle on its forepaws. It's not a big town, so he figures he can go looking in concentric circles, stay on foot for the time being, to make sure he doesn't drive right by Sam if he's, say, passed out somewhere outside. \u201cHe can't be far, right?\u201d he says to the dog. \u201cI mean, supposing he hasn't been zapped somewhere by angels, but so far that's only been my problem. Angels don't like zapping Sam anywhere if they can help it. All right,\u201d he folds up the map, tucks it in the inside pocket of his jacket. \u201cSee you around, boy.\u201d  He heads purposefully toward the entrance of the mall, figures he'll use that as a starting point, work his way around. To his surprise, the dog instantly gets to its feet and trots behind him, feathered tail held high behind it. He turns, makes a shooing motion. \u201cYou can't come with me. Go find Gabriel. Go on, git!\u201d  The dog stops, tail drooping, and whines at him. \u201cNo, I mean it. I have to look for Sam.\u201d  The dog whines again, gives a hopeful wag of its tail, and he sighs. \u201cAre you at least a good tracker?\u201d  The dog cocks its head at him, both ears perked. \u201cI didn't think so. Well, come on, then.\u201d There's a joyous bark, and the dog bounds to his side, tail wagging enthusiastically. \u201cWhy couldn't Gabriel have abandoned a bloodhound?\u201d he grumbles. \u201cI don't have any sheep for you to herd, you know.\u201d  The search goes badly. He spends three hours making his way around the mall, through the streets, checking with every passer-by and shop owner he can find, but no one has seen hide nor hair of Sam. It's like he's fallen off the face of the planet, and by now Dean is hard-pressed not to lose his shit. He calls Bobby, for lack of any better idea, but Bobby doesn't have anything helpful to add either. So he keeps looking until the sun sets and it gets too dark to look properly. He heads back to the car, lets himself sink onto the bumper, head in his hands. \u201cShit shit shit, fuck!\u201d  The dog is still there, has been literally dogging his heels all afternoon and evening. It whines, picking up on his mood, shoves its nose into his ribcage. \u201cI've lost him. What the hell kind of lousy brother am I, that I can't even keep track of Sam when he's a hundred yards away?\u201d he asks the dog. \u201cSome hunter I'm turning out to be. Can't do anything right.\u201d  Predictably enough, the dog doesn't have an answer, and there's nothing left but to head back to the motel. There's a good chance Sam will head back to the room now that they've been separated for so many hours. He pushes himself to his feet, pulls open the door, and nearly gets knocked off his feet as the dog barrels past him and settles into the shotgun seat. \u201cOh, no you don't!\u201d he leans into the car, makes a grab for the dog. \u201cThat's the original leather, you flea-ridden mutt! Get off there!\u201d He tugs fruitlessly at the dog, realizes that it's a lot bigger and a lot heavier than he thought at first. It gives him a shit-eating doggy grin, the furry bastard, and flops onto the seat, tongue hanging out. \u201cWe are not going for a car ride,\u201d he informs it sternly. \u201cI don't care how cute you are.\u201d He goes around the car, yanks open the passenger-side door, and tries to haul out the dog, only to meet with a hundred-odd pounds of very determined canine resistance. \u201cCome on! Son of a bitch,\u201d he stops, stares at the dog. \u201cI don't have time for this. Fine, come with me, then, but you can't stay. And don't drool on the upholstery, or so help me I will kick your furry ass out of the car while it's still running.\u201d  He drives back to the motel, the dog panting happily in the seat next to him, grumbles to himself under his breath about becoming a pushover in his old age. If Sam is there, he'll never let him live down being bullied by a creature that habitually drinks out of the toilet. God, he hopes Sam is there. His life is stressful enough as it is. He unlocks the motel room, turns to order the dog to stay, or whatever, but it's already too late: the dog has wormed its way through his legs and is in the room. He shakes his head, knows when he's defeated. If nothing else, it shows that it's Gabriel's dog: stubborn, and bent on driving him nuts. \u201cSam! Sammy, you here?\u201d There's no answer, but the dog is back at his feet, its tail wagging so hard it's practically a blur of motion. He switches on the light, scans the room for signs that Sam may have come and gone, but there are none. \u201cSam!\u201d The dog cavorts around him, play-snapping at the air, and he reaches down and pats it absentmindedly, dumps his gear on the floor. He checks his phone messages, but apart from a single text message from Bobby (and the thought of Bobby sending text messages still amuses him to no end) saying that he's checking in with some contacts to see if there's been any indication of weirdness or disappearances in the area, there's nothing. There's nothing on the motel phone either, which he checks out of principle rather than because he really thinks Sam would have left a message there. He sinks down on his bed \u2014the one closest the door, as usual\u2014 clasps his hands between his knees, feeling his heart clench in his chest. For the first time, he wonders what he'll do if he can't find Sam, and the thought sends shivers of panic through him. \u201cDammit, Sam, where are you?\u201d  There's a blur of motion, and before he can so much as flinch the dog has launched itself at his chest. It bowls him backward on the bed and straddles him, soft pink tongue lapping at his face, giving him the most thorough licking he's ever received in his life. He sputters, shoves at it, tries to twist away. \u201cAck! Get off! That's... ptuh! That's seriously gross, dude. I only kiss girls on the lips. Get off!\u201d  The dog doesn't budge, but it stops licking him. He's stuck, spreadeagled on the bed with a hundred pounds of dog on his chest. It shoves its nose into his face, fixes him with an intense gaze, the weird-coloured hazel eyes seemingly waiting for him to do something, or maybe say something. For the second time that day it occurs to him that he's never seen a dog with eyes that colour, and if it's a black dog, shouldn't it have brown eyes? He blinks at it. No. It can't be. \u201cSam?\u201d  The dog barks once, and licks the tip of his nose. Oh, shit. \t3. Chapter 3  \u201cCome again?\u201d Bobby's tone is incredulous, and Dean can't blame him. This one is weird, even by Winchester standards. \u201cIt's the only thing that makes sense, Bobby,\u201d he says, watching the dog as it sniffs its way around the edges of the room, taking in everything as though for the first time. Well, it sort of is the first time, he supposes. \u201cIt \u2014he\u2014 even answers to his name. Hey, Sam!\u201d he snaps his fingers. The dog perks up its ears, comes trotting over, and he gives it a friendly scritch behind the ears as a reward, earning himself a tail-wagging. \u201cAre you sure you didn't fall on that fool head of yours, boy?\u201d  \u201cI'm sure, Bobby. One minute I'm fighting off the horde from Dawn of the Dead while Sam is dealing with Night at the Museum in reverse, or whatever, and the next thing I know he's gone and that damned trickster is back in the game. Or angel, or whatever he is.\u201d  \u201cIt don't make a lick of sense. Why would he turn your brother into a dog?\u201d  \u201cBeats me. He did go on for a while about my keeping Sam on too short a leash, so maybe he decided to make it literal? Anyway, it doesn't matter. What matters is turning him back. This is seriously too weird for me. My brother is a _sheepdog_ , Bobby.\u201d He pauses. \u201cAre you laughing?\u201d  It sounds suspiciously like Bobby is sniggering. \u201c'Course not. It ain't a laughing matter, is it?\u201d  \u201cDammit, Bobby, this isn't funny!\u201d  Okay, Bobby is definitely laughing. It sounds as though he's got his hand over the mouthpiece of his phone, but a few seconds later he gives up all pretense, and Dean can hear him guffawing on the other end, hand over the receiver to muffle the sound. \u201cBobby!\u201d  The dog \u2014Sam, he reminds himself\u2014 puts its front paws up on his knees, shoves its head into his face. On the other end of the line, Bobby pulls himself together, still giggling. \u201cOkay, I'm sorry. You gotta admit, it's pretty funny.\u201d  \u201cHilarious.\u201d  \u201cYou're sure it's Sam?\u201d  Dean shrugs, even though Bobby can't see him. \u201cAs sure as I can be. It's not like he can answer me in any way that I can understand. He's a dog.\u201d  \u201cDoes he know what's happened?\u201d  He shoves the dog back onto the floor, fondles its ears, and it leans into the touch, tail thumping. \u201cI don't think so. I mean, I think he knows he's Sam, but I think he's really a dog, too. I mean, he's all happy and tail-waggy and shit. Sam hasn't been this cheerful in, well, ever.\u201d The realization depresses him. He addresses the dog. \u201cYou know you're Sam, right?\u201d  The dog barks once. \u201cI think that's about as much of an answer as I'm ever going to get directly from the horse's mouth. Or the dog's mouth, or whatever.\u201d  Bobby snorts and sounds like he's perilously close to another fit of hysterical laughter. \u201cOkay. Why don't you haul your asses down here, and we'll figure it out. Although I don't need to tell you, boy, that if this is an angel's doing, even if it's just Gabriel, it's going to be damn near impossible to fix unless he wants you to do it.\u201d  \u201cI know,\u201d he rubs his hand over his face. It smells doggy. \u201cI just... God. How does this kind of stuff even happen to us? What am I supposed to do with him in the meantime?\u201d  \u201cHe's your brother. Figure something out. At least dogs like to ride in cars.\u201d  Dean lets himself flop backward on the bed with a groan, tosses the cell phone next to his watch and his wallet on the night stand. The dog \u2014Sam, he tells himself again, still can't quite wrap his mind around it\u2014 prowls along the walls, determined to explore every inch of baseboard, it seems. It shoves its nose in the salt line over the threshold, sneezes, shakes its head, looks up with that endearing doggy grin, and he finds himself grinning back at it. \u201cAt least you're a happy dog. Are you sure you're my emo little brother? There's no way he'd ever let himself be that content. He's all broody and angsty, usually. I figure if he were to turn into a dog he's be one of those dogs with droopy ears and sad eyes. Maybe you're not Sam, maybe you're just some dog named Sam that that freaking trickster left behind just to mess with my head.\u201d  The dog cocks its head to the side, sits on its haunches and watches him. \u201cDo you understand me when I talk? Bark once for 'yes,' twice for 'no. '\u201d  It's possible that that's the stupidest thing he's ever said, he realizes as soon as the words have left his mouth. The dog barks twice, and he has to restrain himself from hitting his head against the wall as hard as he can. \u201cYou're doing it on purpose to screw with me now, aren't you?\u201d  The dog barks once. \u201cFuck you, Sparky.\u201d  The dog barks twice, and then someone hammers furiously on the wall from the room next door. \u201cShut the fuck up in there!\u201d  He pounds the wall back. \u201cShut up yourself!\u201d He turns to \u2014Sam. His brain stutters over the name, can't match it to the body. \u201cOkay, no more barking unless we want to get kicked out. I don't know if we're even allowed animals in here.\u201d He stares at the dog, throws up his hands. \u201cYou know what? I'm not dealing with this tonight. Maybe we'll luck out and it's a twenty-four hour thing, and you'll be back to normal tomorrow. What kind of dog are you, anyway? I know Gabriel said shepherd, but that doesn't exactly narrow it down. You don't look like a German shepherd, and you're definitely not Lassie",

It figures you'd be some sort of froofy European breed.\u201d The dog just gives him a reproachful look. \u201cNice-looking dog, though. Says here you're supposed to be good with kids but that you need lots of exercise. Not that I'm anticipating taking you for long walks, or whatever, so you can forget it.\u201d  The dog's ears perk up at that, and he sighs. No saying the \u201cw\u201d word in front of the dog, copy that. He shuts the laptop, shucks his clothes and tosses them on a chair. There's nothing to do now except sleep it off and hope it's all some sort of really weird dream that he'll never, ever mention to Sam, except to tease him for being turned into a fluffy European dog. He crawls under the bedclothes, pulls them up to his chin, reaches over to switch off the light, when the whole bed lurches to the side, swaying alarmingly. \u201cOh, no! I am not sharing the bed with a dog. You can either take the other bed, or sleep on the floor like a normal dog.\u201d  A moment later he's got a face full of dog, its tongue working over him enthusiastically. \u201cGah! Get off!\u201d he shoves at it ineffectually, and is definitely beginning to sense a pattern here. \u201cFine, fine! You can sleep on the bed. Just not on top of me, got it? Jeez, give a guy some space here, mutt.\u201d  The dog chuffs happily, flops down by his legs with an ominous creak of bedsprings. He switches off the light and lies there, staring at the ceiling, listening to the rhythmic thump-thump-thump of its tail against the bedspread. A few moments later it heaves a sigh of contentment, the tail stops wagging, and the only sound to be heard in the room is its soft breathing. He lets his eyes slip closed, unable to worry overmuch with the comforting weight of the dog leaning against his leg, drifts to sleep.",

Katie-Anne is four feet and three inches of grim determination, holding her boots in one hand and her raincoat in the other. It's been raining steadily for four days now, and while it was easy enough to keep her inside on school days, it's Saturday now, and it's only a matter of time before she wins this particular battle of wills. There's no real reason to keep her inside, either, except for Deborah's maternal instincts which want to keep her daughter safe and dry and warm, none of which will be possible if she goes outside to play in the rain. Then again, playing in the rain and splashing in puddles is a time-honoured childhood rite of passage, and who is she to deny her daughter that pleasure?",

She spends the night forcing fluids into him with an IV drip, and quickly finds that she has to resort to a sedative in spite of the pneumonia, because he keeps wriggling and trying to jump down first from the exam table and then away from the x-ray machine. Even sedated, he keeps looking first at her, then at the door, as though he has somewhere pressing to be and doesn't really have time to deal with this injury nonsense, occasionally whining at her as though asking her to let him out again. \u201cSorry, buddy.

Except that he doesn't come, and Sam is all alone. He rests his muzzle on his paws, heaves a sigh, tries sleeping. He even succeeds for a while, but not for long. He sits up, scents the air for Dean, but there's nothing there, and he sinks down again, his heart heavy. Eventually hunger overrides _wait-for-Dean_ , and he goes to look for food, because Dean has left his bowl and all the kibble where Sam can't get to it.
